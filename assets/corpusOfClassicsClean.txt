My fathers family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my
infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit
than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.
 
I give Pirrip as my fathers family name, on the authority of his
tombstone and my sister,Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith.
As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness
of either of them for their days were long before the days of
photographs, my first fancies regarding what they were like were
unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on
my fathers, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man,
with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription,
"Also Georgiana Wife of the Above," I drew a childish conclusion that
my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each
about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside
their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of
mine,who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in
that universal struggle,I am indebted for a belief I religiously
entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands
in their trouserspockets, and had never taken them out in this state of
existence.
 
Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river
wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad impression
of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable
raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out for certain
that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard and
that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the
above, were dead and buried and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham,
Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead
and buried and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard,
intersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle
feeding on it, was the marshes and that the low leaden line beyond
was the river and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was
rushing was the sea and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid
of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.
 
"Hold your noise!" cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from
among the graves at the side of the church porch. "Keep still, you
little devil, or Ill cut your throat!"
 
A fearful man, all in coarse gray, with a great iron on his leg. A man
with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his
head. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and
lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by
briars who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled and whose
teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.
 
"Oh! Dont cut my throat, sir," I pleaded in terror. "Pray dont do it,
sir."
 
"Tell us your name!" said the man. "Quick!"
 
"Pip, sir."
 
"Once more," said the man, staring at me. "Give it mouth!"
 
"Pip. Pip, sir."
 
"Show us where you live," said the man. "Pint out the place!"
 
I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat inshore among the
aldertrees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.
 
The man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and
emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread. When
the church came to itself,for he was so sudden and strong that he
made it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my
feet,when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high
tombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.
 
"You young dog," said the man, licking his lips, "what fat cheeks you
ha got."
 
I believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my
years, and not strong.
 
"Darn me if I couldnt eat em," said the man, with a threatening shake
of his head, "and if I hant half a mind tot!"
 
I earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldnt, and held tighter to
the tombstone on which he had put me partly, to keep myself upon it
partly, to keep myself from crying.
 
"Now lookee here!" said the man. "Wheres your mother?"
 
"There, sir!" said I.
 
He started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.
 
"There, sir!" I timidly explained. "Also Georgiana. Thats my mother."
 
"Oh!" said he, coming back. "And is that your father alonger your
mother?"
 
"Yes, sir," said I "him too late of this parish."
 
"Ha!" he muttered then, considering. "Who dye live with,supposin
youre kindly let to live, which I hant made up my mind about?"
 
"My sister, sir,Mrs. Joe Gargery,wife of Joe Gargery, the
blacksmith, sir."
 
"Blacksmith, eh?" said he. And looked down at his leg.
 
After darkly looking at his leg and me several times, he came closer
to my tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he
could hold me so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine,
and mine looked most helplessly up into his.
 
"Now lookee here," he said, "the question being whether youre to be let
to live. You know what a file is?"
 
"Yes, sir."
 
"And you know what wittles is?"
 
"Yes, sir."
 
After each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a
greater sense of helplessness and danger.
 
"You get me a file." He tilted me again. "And you get me wittles." He
tilted me again. "You bring em both to me." He tilted me again. "Or
Ill have your heart and liver out." He tilted me again.
 
I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both
hands, and said, "If you would kindly please to let me keep upright,
sir, perhaps I shouldnt be sick, and perhaps I could attend more."
 
He gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped
over its own weathercock. Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright
position on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms
 
"You bring me, tomorrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You
bring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and you
never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having
seen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall be let to
live. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no matter how
small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore out, roasted,
and ate. Now, I aint alone, as you may think I am. Theres a young man
hid with me, in comparison with which young man I am a Angel. That young
man hears the words I speak. That young man has a secret way pecooliar
to himself, of getting at a boy, and at his heart, and at his liver. It
is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man. A
boy may lock his door, may be warm in bed, may tuck himself up, may draw
the clothes over his head, may think himself comfortable and safe, but
that young man will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him
open. I am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present
moment, with great difficulty. I find it wery hard to hold that young
man off of your inside. Now, what do you say?"
 
I said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken
bits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in
the morning.
 
"Say Lord strike you dead if you dont!" said the man.
 
I said so, and he took me down.
 
"Now," he pursued, "you remember what youve undertook, and you remember
that young man, and you get home!"
 
"Googood night, sir," I faltered.
 
"Much of that!" said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat. "I
wish I was a frog. Or a eel!"
 
At the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his
arms,clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,and limped
towards the low church wall. As I saw him go, picking his way among the
nettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked
in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people,
stretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his
ankle and pull him in.
 
When he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose
legs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me. When I
saw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of
my legs. But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going on
again towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and picking
his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the
marshes here and there, for steppingplaces when the rains were heavy or
the tide was in.
 
The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped
to look after him and the river was just another horizontal line, not
nearly so broad nor yet so black and the sky was just a row of long
angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the edge of the
river I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the
prospect that seemed to be standing upright one of these was the beacon
by which the sailors steered,like an unhooped cask upon a pole,an
ugly thing when you were near it the other, a gibbet, with some chains
hanging to it which had once held a pirate. The man was limping on
towards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life, and come
down, and going back to hook himself up again. It gave me a terrible
turn when I thought so and as I saw the cattle lifting their heads to
gaze after him, I wondered whether they thought so too. I looked all
round for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of him. But now
I was frightened again, and ran home without stopping.
 
 
 
 
 
My sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I,
and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors
because she had brought me up "by hand." Having at that time to find out
for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a hard and
heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as
well as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up
by hand.
 
She was not a goodlooking woman, my sister and I had a general
impression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand. Joe
was a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth
face, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed
to have somehow got mixed with their own whites. He was a mild,
goodnatured, sweettempered, easygoing, foolish, dear fellow,a sort
of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.
 
My sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing
redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible
she washed herself with a nutmeggrater instead of soap. She was tall
and bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her
figure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in
front, that was stuck full of pins and needles. She made it a powerful
merit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore this
apron so much. Though I really see no reason why she should have worn it
at all or why, if she did wear it at all, she should not have taken it
off, every day of her life.
 
Joes forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of the
dwellings in our country were,most of them, at that time. When I ran
home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was sitting
alone in the kitchen. Joe and I being fellowsufferers, and having
confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment I
raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it,
sitting in the chimney corner.
 
"Mrs. Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip. And shes
out now, making it a bakers dozen."
 
"Is she?"
 
"Yes, Pip," said Joe "and whats worse, shes got Tickler with her."
 
At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat
round and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Tickler
was a waxended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled
frame.
 
"She sot down," said Joe, "and she got up, and she made a grab at
Tickler, and she Rampaged out. Thats what she did," said Joe, slowly
clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at
it "she Rampaged out, Pip."
 
"Has she been gone long, Joe?" I always treated him as a larger species
of child, and as no more than my equal.
 
"Well," said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, "shes been on the
Rampage, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip. Shes a coming! Get
behind the door, old chap, and have the jacktowel betwixt you."
 
I took the advice. My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open,
and finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause, and
applied Tickler to its further investigation. She concluded by throwing
meI often served as a connubial missileat Joe, who, glad to get hold
of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me
up there with his great leg.
 
"Where have you been, you young monkey?" said Mrs. Joe, stamping her
foot. "Tell me directly what youve been doing to wear me away with fret
and fright and worrit, or Id have you out of that corner if you was
fifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys."
 
"I have only been to the churchyard," said I, from my stool, crying and
rubbing myself.
 
"Churchyard!" repeated my sister. "If it warnt for me youd have been
to the churchyard long ago, and stayed there. Who brought you up by
hand?"
 
"You did," said I.
 
"And why did I do it, I should like to know?" exclaimed my sister.
 
I whimpered, "I dont know."
 
"I dont!" said my sister. "Id never do it again! I know that. I may
truly say Ive never had this apron of mine off since born you were.
Its bad enough to be a blacksmiths wife and him a Gargery without
being your mother."
 
My thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at
the fire. For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, the
mysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I was
under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before me
in the avenging coals.
 
"Hah!" said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station. "Churchyard,
indeed! You may well say churchyard, you two." One of us, by the by, had
not said it at all. "Youll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you, one
of these days, and O, a prrrecious pair youd be without me!"
 
As she applied herself to set the teathings, Joe peeped down at me
over his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, and
calculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the
grievous circumstances foreshadowed. After that, he sat feeling his
rightside flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with
his blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times.
 
My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us,
that never varied. First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard
and fast against her bib,where it sometimes got a pin into it, and
sometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then she
took some butter not too much on a knife and spread it on the loaf, in
an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,using both
sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and moulding
the butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife a final smart
wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very thick round off
the loaf which she finally, before separating from the loaf, hewed into
two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.
 
On the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my
slice. I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful
acquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man. I knew
Mrs. Joes housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my
larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe. Therefore
I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of my
trousers.
 
The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I
found to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap
from the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.
And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In
our alreadymentioned freemasonry as fellowsufferers, and in his
goodnatured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare
the way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each
others admiration now and then,which stimulated us to new exertions.
Tonight, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast
diminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition but
he found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and
my untouched bread and butter on the other. At last, I desperately
considered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it
had best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the
circumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at
me, and got my bread and butter down my leg.
 
Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss
of appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he
didnt seem to enjoy. He turned it about in his mouth much longer than
usual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like
a pill. He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on
one side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw
that my bread and butter was gone.
 
The wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold
of his bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sisters
observation.
 
"Whats the matter now?" said she, smartly, as she put down her cup.
 
"I say, you know!" muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in very serious
remonstrance. "Pip, old chap! Youll do yourself a mischief. Itll stick
somewhere. You cant have chawed it, Pip."
 
"Whats the matter now?" repeated my sister, more sharply than before.
 
"If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, Id recommend you to do it,"
said Joe, all aghast. "Manners is manners, but still your elths your
elth."
 
By this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe,
and, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little while
against the wall behind him, while I sat in the corner, looking guiltily
on.
 
"Now, perhaps youll mention whats the matter," said my sister, out of
breath, "you staring great stuck pig."
 
Joe looked at her in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and
looked at me again.
 
"You know, Pip," said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek,
and speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone,
"you and me is always friends, and Id be the last to tell upon you,
any time. But such a" he moved his chair and looked about the floor
between us, and then again at me"such a most oncommon Bolt as that!"
 
"Been bolting his food, has he?" cried my sister.
 
"You know, old chap," said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe,
with his bite still in his cheek, "I Bolted, myself, when I was your
agefrequentand as a boy Ive been among a many Bolters but I never
see your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and its a mercy you aint Bolted
dead."
 
My sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, saying
nothing more than the awful words, "You come along and be dosed."
 
Some medical beast had revived Tarwater in those days as a fine
medicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard
having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness. At the
best of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice
restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like a new
fence. On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a
pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater
comfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would
be held in a bootjack. Joe got off with half a pint but was made to
swallow that much to his disturbance, as he sat slowly munching and
meditating before the fire, "because he had had a turn." Judging from
myself, I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had had
none before.
 
Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy but when, in
the case of a boy, that secret burden cooperates with another secret
burden down the leg of his trousers, it is as I can testify a great
punishment. The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. JoeI
never thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the
housekeeping property as hisunited to the necessity of always keeping
one hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about
the kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind. Then,
as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the
voice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to
secrecy, declaring that he couldnt and wouldnt starve until tomorrow,
but must be fed now. At other times, I thought, What if the young man
who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his hands in me
should yield to a constitutional impatience, or should mistake the time,
and should think himself accredited to my heart and liver tonight,
instead of tomorrow! If ever anybodys hair stood on end with terror,
mine must have done so then. But, perhaps, nobodys ever did?
 
It was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with
a copperstick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried it with
the load upon my leg and that made me think afresh of the man with the
load on HIS leg, and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread
and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable. Happily I slipped away,
and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.
 
"Hark!" said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final warm
in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed "was that great guns,
Joe?"
 
"Ah!" said Joe. "Theres another conwict off."
 
"What does that mean, Joe?" said I.
 
Mrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly,
"Escaped. Escaped." Administering the definition like Tarwater.
 
While Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I put my
mouth into the forms of saying to Joe, "Whats a convict?" Joe put his
mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer, that I
could make out nothing of it but the single word "Pip."
 
"There was a conwict off last night," said Joe, aloud, "after
sunsetgun. And they fired warning of him. And now it appears theyre
firing warning of another."
 
"Whos firing?" said I.
 
"Drat that boy," interposed my sister, frowning at me over her work,
"what a questioner he is. Ask no questions, and youll be told no lies."
 
It was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should be
told lies by her even if I did ask questions. But she never was polite
unless there was company.
 
At this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost
pains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a word
that looked to me like "sulks." Therefore, I naturally pointed to Mrs.
Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, "her?" But Joe wouldnt
hear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide, and shook
the form of a most emphatic word out of it. But I could make nothing of
the word.
 
"Mrs. Joe," said I, as a last resort, "I should like to knowif you
wouldnt much mindwhere the firing comes from?"
 
"Lord bless the boy!" exclaimed my sister, as if she didnt quite mean
that but rather the contrary. "From the Hulks!"
 
"Ohh!" said I, looking at Joe. "Hulks!"
 
Joe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, "Well, I told you so."
 
"And please, whats Hulks?" said I.
 
"Thats the way with this boy!" exclaimed my sister, pointing me out
with her needle and thread, and shaking her head at me. "Answer him one
question, and hell ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are prisonships,
right cross th meshes." We always used that name for marshes, in our
country.
 
"I wonder whos put into prisonships, and why theyre put there?" said
I, in a general way, and with quiet desperation.
 
It was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose. "I tell you what,
young fellow," said she, "I didnt bring you up by hand to badger
peoples lives out. It would be blame to me and not praise, if I had.
People are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob,
and forge, and do all sorts of bad and they always begin by asking
questions. Now, you get along to bed!"
 
I was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went up
stairs in the dark, with my head tingling,from Mrs. Joes thimble
having played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last words,I
felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were
handy for me. I was clearly on my way there. I had begun by asking
questions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe.
 
Since that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thought
that few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror.
No matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror. I was in
mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver I was
in mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg I was in mortal
terror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted I had
no hope of deliverance through my allpowerful sister, who repulsed
me at every turn I am afraid to think of what I might have done on
requirement, in the secrecy of my terror.
 
If I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting
down the river on a strong springtide, to the Hulks a ghostly
pirate calling out to me through a speakingtrumpet, as I passed the
gibbetstation, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there at
once, and not put it off. I was afraid to sleep, even if I had been
inclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must rob
the pantry. There was no doing it in the night, for there was no getting
a light by easy friction then to have got one I must have struck it out
of flint and steel, and have made a noise like the very pirate himself
rattling his chains.
 
As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot
with gray, I got up and went down stairs every board upon the way, and
every crack in every board calling after me, "Stop thief!" and "Get up,
Mrs. Joe!" In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied than
usual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a hare hanging
up by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught when my back was half
turned, winking. I had no time for verification, no time for selection,
no time for anything, for I had no time to spare. I stole some bread,
some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat which I tied up in
my pockethandkerchief with my last nights slice, some brandy from a
stone bottle which I decanted into a glass bottle I had secretly used
for making that intoxicating fluid, Spanishliquoricewater, up in my
room diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboard,
a meat bone with very little on it, and a beautiful round compact pork
pie. I was nearly going away without the pie, but I was tempted to mount
upon a shelf, to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a
covered earthen ware dish in a corner, and I found it was the pie, and
I took it in the hope that it was not intended for early use, and would
not be missed for some time.
 
There was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge I
unlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joes tools.
Then I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at which
I had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for the misty
marshes.
 
 
 
 
 
It was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying on the
outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there all
night, and using the window for a pockethandkerchief. Now, I saw the
damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort of
spiders webs hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade. On
every rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so thick,
that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our villagea
direction which they never accepted, for they never came therewas
invisible to me until I was quite close under it. Then, as I looked up
at it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a
phantom devoting me to the Hulks.
 
The mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so that
instead of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at me.
This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind. The gates and dikes and
banks came bursting at me through the mist, as if they cried as plainly
as could be, "A boy with Somebodys elses pork pie! Stop him!" The
cattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes,
and steaming out of their nostrils, "Halloa, young thief!" One black
ox, with a white cravat on,who even had to my awakened conscience
something of a clerical air,fixed me so obstinately with his eyes,
and moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved
round, that I blubbered out to him, "I couldnt help it, sir! It wasnt
for myself I took it!" Upon which he put down his head, blew a cloud of
smoke out of his nose, and vanished with a kickup of his hindlegs and
a flourish of his tail.
 
All this time, I was getting on towards the river but however fast I
went, I couldnt warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted, as
the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet. I knew
my way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down there on a
Sunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old gun, had told me that when
I was prentice to him, regularly bound, we would have such Larks there!
However, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last too far to
the right, and consequently had to try back along the riverside, on the
bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide
out. Making my way along here with all despatch, I had just crossed a
ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and had just scrambled
up the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the man sitting before me.
His back was towards me, and he had his arms folded, and was nodding
forward, heavy with sleep.
 
I thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his breakfast,
in that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched him on
the shoulder. He instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, but
another man!
 
And yet this man was dressed in coarse gray, too, and had a great iron
on his leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was everything that
the other man was except that he had not the same face, and had a flat
broadbrimmed lowcrowned felt hat on. All this I saw in a moment, for
I had only a moment to see it in he swore an oath at me, made a hit at
me,it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself
down, for it made him stumble,and then he ran into the mist, stumbling
twice as he went, and I lost him.
 
"Its the young man!" I thought, feeling my heart shoot as I identified
him. I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver, too, if I had
known where it was.
 
I was soon at the Battery after that, and there was the right
Man,hugging himself and limping to and fro, as if he had never all
night left off hugging and limping,waiting for me. He was awfully
cold, to be sure. I half expected to see him drop down before my face
and die of deadly cold. His eyes looked so awfully hungry too, that when
I handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass, it occurred to
me he would have tried to eat it, if he had not seen my bundle. He did
not turn me upside down this time to get at what I had, but left me
right side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied my pockets.
 
"Whats in the bottle, boy?" said he.
 
"Brandy," said I.
 
He was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious
manner,more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent
hurry, than a man who was eating it,but he left off to take some of
the liquor. He shivered all the while so violently, that it was quite
as much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his teeth,
without biting it off.
 
"I think you have got the ague," said I.
 
"Im much of your opinion, boy," said he.
 
"Its bad about here," I told him. "Youve been lying out on the meshes,
and theyre dreadful aguish. Rheumatic too."
 
"Ill eat my breakfast afore theyre the death of me," said he. "Id do
that, if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is
over there, directly afterwards. Ill beat the shivers so far, Ill bet
you."
 
He was gobbling mincemeat, meatbone, bread, cheese, and pork pie, all
at once staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round
us, and often stoppingeven stopping his jawsto listen. Some real or
fancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the
marsh, now gave him a start, and he said, suddenly,
 
"Youre not a deceiving imp? You brought no one with you?"
 
"No, sir! No!"
 
"Nor giv no one the office to follow you?"
 
"No!"
 
"Well," said he, "I believe you. Youd be but a fierce young hound
indeed, if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched
warmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint
is!"
 
Something clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock,
and was going to strike. And he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over his
eyes.
 
Pitying his desolation, and watching him as he gradually settled down
upon the pie, I made bold to say, "I am glad you enjoy it."
 
"Did you speak?"
 
"I said I was glad you enjoyed it."
 
"Thankee, my boy. I do."
 
I had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food and I now
noticed a decided similarity between the dogs way of eating, and the
mans. The man took strong sharp sudden bites, just like the dog. He
swallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too fast
and he looked sideways here and there while he ate, as if he thought
there was danger in every direction of somebodys coming to take the pie
away. He was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it, to appreciate
it comfortably I thought, or to have anybody to dine with him, without
making a chop with his jaws at the visitor. In all of which particulars
he was very like the dog.
 
"I am afraid you wont leave any of it for him," said I, timidly after
a silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of making
the remark. "Theres no more to be got where that came from." It was the
certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint.
 
"Leave any for him? Whos him?" said my friend, stopping in his
crunching of piecrust.
 
"The young man. That you spoke of. That was hid with you."
 
"Oh ah!" he returned, with something like a gruff laugh. "Him? Yes, yes!
He dont want no wittles."
 
"I thought he looked as if he did," said I.
 
The man stopped eating, and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and
the greatest surprise.
 
"Looked? When?"
 
"Just now."
 
"Where?"
 
"Yonder," said I, pointing "over there, where I found him nodding
asleep, and thought it was you."
 
He held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to think his
first idea about cutting my throat had revived.
 
"Dressed like you, you know, only with a hat," I explained, trembling
"andand"I was very anxious to put this delicately"and withthe
same reason for wanting to borrow a file. Didnt you hear the cannon
last night?"
 
"Then there was firing!" he said to himself.
 
"I wonder you shouldnt have been sure of that," I returned, "for
we heard it up at home, and thats farther away, and we were shut in
besides."
 
"Why, see now!" said he. "When a mans alone on these flats, with a
light head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, he hears
nothin all night, but guns firing, and voices calling. Hears? He sees
the soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried
afore, closing in round him. Hears his number called, hears himself
challenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, hears the orders Make
ready! Present! Cover him steady, men! and is laid hands onand
theres nothin! Why, if I see one pursuing party last nightcoming up
in order, Damn em, with their tramp, trampI see a hundred. And as to
firing! Why, I see the mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broad
day,But this man" he had said all the rest, as if he had forgotten my
being there "did you notice anything in him?"
 
"He had a badly bruised face," said I, recalling what I hardly knew I
knew.
 
"Not here?" exclaimed the man, striking his left cheek mercilessly, with
the flat of his hand.
 
"Yes, there!"
 
"Where is he?" He crammed what little food was left, into the breast of
his gray jacket. "Show me the way he went. Ill pull him down, like a
bloodhound. Curse this iron on my sore leg! Give us hold of the file,
boy."
 
I indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man,
and he looked up at it for an instant. But he was down on the rank wet
grass, filing at his iron like a madman, and not minding me or minding
his own leg, which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody, but which he
handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file. I
was very much afraid of him again, now that he had worked himself into
this fierce hurry, and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping away
from home any longer. I told him I must go, but he took no notice, so
I thought the best thing I could do was to slip off. The last I saw
of him, his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his
fetter, muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg. The last
I heard of him, I stopped in the mist to listen, and the file was still
going.
 
 
 
 
I fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take me
up. But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yet
been made of the robbery. Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the
house ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon
the kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dustpan,an article into
which his destiny always led him, sooner or later, when my sister was
vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.
 
"And where the deuce ha you been?" was Mrs. Joes Christmas salutation,
when I and my conscience showed ourselves.
 
I said I had been down to hear the Carols. "Ah! well!" observed Mrs.
Joe. "You might ha done worse." Not a doubt of that I thought.
 
"Perhaps if I warnt a blacksmiths wife, and whats the same thing a
slave with her apron never off, I should have been to hear the Carols,"
said Mrs. Joe. "Im rather partial to Carols, myself, and thats the
best of reasons for my never hearing any."
 
Joe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had
retired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with a
conciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when her eyes
were withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, and exhibited them
to me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper. This was so
much her normal state, that Joe and I would often, for weeks together,
be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to their legs.
 
We were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork and
greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls. A handsome mincepie had
been made yesterday morning which accounted for the mincemeat not
being missed, and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensive
arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of
breakfast "for I aint," said Mrs. Joe,"I aint a going to have
no formal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what Ive got
before me, I promise you!"
 
So, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on a
forced march instead of a man and boy at home and we took gulps of milk
and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the dresser. In
the meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and tacked a new
flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one, and
uncovered the little state parlor across the passage, which was never
uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the year in a cool
haze of silver paper, which even extended to the four little white
crockery poodles on the mantelshelf, each with a black nose and a
basket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart of the other.
Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of
making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt
itself. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the same by
their religion.
 
My sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that
is to say, Joe and I were going. In his workingclothes, Joe was a
wellknit characteristiclooking blacksmith in his holiday clothes,
he was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.
Nothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him and
everything that he wore then grazed him. On the present festive occasion
he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going, the picture
of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me, I think my
sister must have had some general idea that I was a young offender whom
an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up on my birthday and delivered over
to her, to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of the law.
I was always treated as if I had insisted on being born in opposition
to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality, and against the
dissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when I was taken to have
a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of
Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs.
 
Joe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle
for compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to
what I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever
Mrs. Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be
equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had
done. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the
Church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the
terrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived the
idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman said,
"Ye are now to declare it!" would be the time for me to rise and propose
a private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure that I
might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to this
extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.
 
Mr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us and Mr. Hubble
the wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble and Uncle Pumblechook Joes uncle,
but Mrs. Joe appropriated him, who was a welltodo cornchandler in
the nearest town, and drove his own chaisecart. The dinner hour was
halfpast one. When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and
Mrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked
it never was at any other time for the company to enter by, and
everything most splendid. And still, not a word of the robbery.
 
The time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, and
the company came. Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large shining
bald forehead, had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud of indeed
it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could only give him
his head, he would read the clergyman into fits he himself confessed
that if the Church was "thrown open," meaning to competition, he would
not despair of making his mark in it. The Church not being "thrown
open," he was, as I have said, our clerk. But he punished the Amens
tremendously and when he gave out the psalm,always giving the whole
verse,he looked all round the congregation first, as much as to say,
"You have heard my friend overhead oblige me with your opinion of this
style!"
 
I opened the door to the company,making believe that it was a habit
of ours to open that door,and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next
to Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook. N.B. I was
not allowed to call him uncle, under the severest penalties.
 
"Mrs. Joe," said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hardbreathing middleaged
slow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair
standing upright on his head, so that he looked as if he had just been
all but choked, and had that moment come to, "I have brought you as the
compliments of the seasonI have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry
wineand I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine."
 
Every Christmas Day he presented himself, as a profound novelty, with
exactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumbbells.
Every Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she now replied, "O, Uncle
Pumblechook! This is kind!" Every Christmas Day, he retorted, as
he now retorted, "Its no more than your merits. And now are you all
bobbish, and hows Sixpennorth of halfpence?" meaning me.
 
We dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts
and oranges and apples to the parlor which was a change very like
Joes change from his workingclothes to his Sunday dress. My sister was
uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally more
gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company. I remember
Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharpedged person in skyblue, who held a
conventionally juvenile position, because she had married Mr. Hubble,I
dont know at what remote period,when she was much younger than he. I
remember Mr Hubble as a tough, highshouldered, stooping old man, of a
sawdusty fragrance, with his legs extraordinarily wide apart so that in
my short days I always saw some miles of open country between them when
I met him coming up the lane.
 
Among this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadnt
robbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in
at an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and the
Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to speak
I didnt want to speak, nor because I was regaled with the scaly tips
of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure corners of pork
of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason to be vain. No
I should not have minded that, if they would only have left me alone.
But they wouldnt leave me alone. They seemed to think the opportunity
lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me, every now and
then, and stick the point into me. I might have been an unfortunate
little bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched up by these
moral goads.
 
It began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace with
theatrical declamation,as it now appears to me, something like a
religious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,and
ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.
Upon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a low
reproachful voice, "Do you hear that? Be grateful."
 
"Especially," said Mr. Pumblechook, "be grateful, boy, to them which
brought you up by hand."
 
Mrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournful
presentiment that I should come to no good, asked, "Why is it that the
young are never grateful?" This moral mystery seemed too much for
the company until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, "Naterally
wicious." Everybody then murmured "True!" and looked at me in a
particularly unpleasant and personal manner.
 
Joes station and influence were something feebler if possible when
there was company than when there was none. But he always aided and
comforted me when he could, in some way of his own, and he always did so
at dinnertime by giving me gravy, if there were any. There being plenty
of gravy today, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, about half a
pint.
 
A little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with
some severity, and intimatedin the usual hypothetical case of the
Church being "thrown open"what kind of sermon he would have given
them. After favoring them with some heads of that discourse, he remarked
that he considered the subject of the days homily, ill chosen which
was the less excusable, he added, when there were so many subjects
"going about."
 
"True again," said Uncle Pumblechook. "Youve hit it, sir! Plenty of
subjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon their
tails. Thats whats wanted. A man neednt go far to find a subject,
if hes ready with his saltbox." Mr. Pumblechook added, after a short
interval of reflection, "Look at Pork alone. Theres a subject! If you
want a subject, look at Pork!"
 
"True, sir. Many a moral for the young," returned Mr. Wopsle,and I
knew he was going to lug me in, before he said it "might be deduced
from that text."
 
"You listen to this," said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.
 
Joe gave me some more gravy.
 
"Swine," pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing his fork
at my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name,"swine were
the companions of the prodigal. The gluttony of Swine is put before us,
as an example to the young." I thought this pretty well in him who
had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy. "What is
detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy."
 
"Or girl," suggested Mr. Hubble.
 
"Of course, or girl, Mr. Hubble," assented Mr. Wopsle, rather irritably,
"but there is no girl present."
 
"Besides," said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, "think what youve
got to be grateful for. If youd been born a Squeaker"
 
"He was, if ever a child was," said my sister, most emphatically.
 
Joe gave me some more gravy.
 
"Well, but I mean a fourfooted Squeaker," said Mr. Pumblechook. "If you
had been born such, would you have been here now? Not you"
 
"Unless in that form," said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.
 
"But I dont mean in that form, sir," returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had
an objection to being interrupted "I mean, enjoying himself with his
elders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, and
rolling in the lap of luxury. Would he have been doing that? No, he
wouldnt. And what would have been your destination?" turning on me
again. "You would have been disposed of for so many shillings according
to the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would have
come up to you as you lay in your straw, and he would have whipped you
under his left arm, and with his right he would have tucked up his frock
to get a penknife from out of his waistcoatpocket, and he would have
shed your blood and had your life. No bringing up by hand then. Not a
bit of it!"
 
Joe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.
 
"He was a world of trouble to you, maam," said Mrs. Hubble,
commiserating my sister.
 
"Trouble?" echoed my sister "trouble?" and then entered on a fearful
catalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts
of sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled
from, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I
had done myself, and all the times she had wished me in my grave, and I
had contumaciously refused to go there.
 
I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with
their noses. Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in
consequence. Anyhow, Mr. Wopsles Roman nose so aggravated me, during
the recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it
until he howled. But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing in
comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the
pause was broken which ensued upon my sisters recital, and in which
pause everybody had looked at me as I felt painfully conscious with
indignation and abhorrence.
 
"Yet," said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the
theme from which they had strayed, "Porkregarded as biledis rich,
too aint it?"
 
"Have a little brandy, uncle," said my sister.
 
O Heavens, it had come at last! He would find it was weak, he would say
it was weak, and I was lost! I held tight to the leg of the table under
the cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.
 
My sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle,
and poured his brandy out no one else taking any. The wretched man
trifled with his glass,took it up, looked at it through the light,
put it down,prolonged my misery. All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were
briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.
 
I couldnt keep my eyes off him. Always holding tight by the leg of the
table with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger his
glass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink
the brandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with
unspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning
round several times in an appalling spasmodic whoopingcough dance,
and rushing out at the door he then became visible through the window,
violently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces, and
apparently out of his mind.
 
I held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him. I didnt know how
I had done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow. In my
dreadful situation, it was a relief when he was brought back, and
surveying the company all round as if they had disagreed with him, sank
down into his chair with the one significant gasp, "Tar!"
 
I had filled up the bottle from the tarwater jug. I knew he would be
worse by and by. I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day, by
the vigor of my unseen hold upon it.
 
"Tar!" cried my sister, in amazement. "Why, how ever could Tar come
there?"
 
But, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldnt
hear the word, wouldnt hear of the subject, imperiously waved it all
away with his hand, and asked for hot gin and water. My sister, who had
begun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively in
getting the gin the hot water, the sugar, and the lemonpeel, and mixing
them. For the time being at least, I was saved. I still held on to the
leg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude.
 
By degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of
pudding. Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding. All partook of pudding.
The course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the
genial influence of gin and water. I began to think I should get over
the day, when my sister said to Joe, "Clean plates,cold."
 
I clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to my
bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul.
I foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was gone.
 
"You must taste," said my sister, addressing the guests with her best
grace"you must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and delicious
present of Uncle Pumblechooks!"
 
Must they! Let them not hope to taste it!
 
"You must know," said my sister, rising, "its a pie a savory pork
pie."
 
The company murmured their compliments. Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of
having deserved well of his fellowcreatures, said,quite vivaciously,
all things considered,"Well, Mrs. Joe, well do our best endeavors
let us have a cut at this same pie."
 
My sister went out to get it. I heard her steps proceed to the pantry. I
saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife. I saw reawakening appetite in the
Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle. I heard Mr. Hubble remark that "a bit of
savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do
no harm," and I heard Joe say, "You shall have some, Pip." I have never
been absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror,
merely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company. I felt that I
could bear no more, and that I must run away. I released the leg of the
table, and ran for my life.
 
But I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran headforemost
into a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out a pair
of handcuffs to me, saying, "Here you are, look sharp, come on!"
 
 
 
 
Chapter V
 
The apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the butends of their
loaded muskets on our doorstep, caused the dinnerparty to rise
from table in confusion, and caused Mrs. Joe reentering the kitchen
emptyhanded, to stop short and stare, in her wondering lament of
"Gracious goodness gracious me, whats gonewith thepie!"
 
The sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood staring
at which crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses. It was
the sergeant who had spoken to me, and he was now looking round at the
company, with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his
right hand, and his left on my shoulder.
 
"Excuse me, ladies and gentleman," said the sergeant, "but as I have
mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver," which he hadnt, "I
am on a chase in the name of the king, and I want the blacksmith."
 
"And pray what might you want with him?" retorted my sister, quick to
resent his being wanted at all.
 
"Missis," returned the gallant sergeant, "speaking for myself, I should
reply, the honor and pleasure of his fine wifes acquaintance speaking
for the king, I answer, a little job done."
 
This was received as rather neat in the sergeant insomuch that Mr.
Pumblechook cried audibly, "Good again!"
 
"You see, blacksmith," said the sergeant, who had by this time picked
out Joe with his eye, "we have had an accident with these, and I find
the lock of one of em goes wrong, and the coupling dont act pretty.
As they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye over
them?"
 
Joe threw his eye over them, and pronounced that the job would
necessitate the lighting of his forge fire, and would take nearer
two hours than one, "Will it? Then will you set about it at once,
blacksmith?" said the offhand sergeant, "as its on his Majestys
service. And if my men can bear a hand anywhere, theyll make themselves
useful." With that, he called to his men, who came trooping into the
kitchen one after another, and piled their arms in a corner. And then
they stood about, as soldiers do now, with their hands loosely clasped
before them now, resting a knee or a shoulder now, easing a belt or a
pouch now, opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks, out
into the yard.
 
All these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them, for I
was in an agony of apprehension. But beginning to perceive that the
handcuffs were not for me, and that the military had so far got the
better of the pie as to put it in the background, I collected a little
more of my scattered wits.
 
"Would you give me the time?" said the sergeant, addressing himself to
Mr. Pumblechook, as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the
inference that he was equal to the time.
 
"Its just gone half past two."
 
"Thats not so bad," said the sergeant, reflecting "even if I was
forced to halt here nigh two hours, thatll do. How far might you call
yourselves from the marshes, hereabouts? Not above a mile, I reckon?"
 
"Just a mile," said Mrs. Joe.
 
"Thatll do. We begin to close in upon em about dusk. A little before
dusk, my orders are. Thatll do."
 
"Convicts, sergeant?" asked Mr. Wopsle, in a matterofcourse way.
 
"Ay!" returned the sergeant, "two. Theyre pretty well known to be out
on the marshes still, and they wont try to get clear of em before
dusk. Anybody here seen anything of any such game?"
 
Everybody, myself excepted, said no, with confidence. Nobody thought of
me.
 
"Well!" said the sergeant, "theyll find themselves trapped in a circle,
I expect, sooner than they count on. Now, blacksmith! If youre ready,
his Majesty the King is."
 
Joe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and his leather apron
on, and passed into the forge. One of the soldiers opened its wooden
windows, another lighted the fire, another turned to at the bellows, the
rest stood round the blaze, which was soon roaring. Then Joe began to
hammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all looked on.
 
The interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general
attention, but even made my sister liberal. She drew a pitcher of beer
from the cask for the soldiers, and invited the sergeant to take a glass
of brandy. But Mr. Pumblechook said, sharply, "Give him wine, Mum. Ill
engage theres no Tar in that" so, the sergeant thanked him and said
that as he preferred his drink without tar, he would take wine, if it
was equally convenient. When it was given him, he drank his Majestys
health and compliments of the season, and took it all at a mouthful and
smacked his lips.
 
"Good stuff, eh, sergeant?" said Mr. Pumblechook.
 
"Ill tell you something," returned the sergeant "I suspect that
stuffs of your providing."
 
Mr. Pumblechook, with a fat sort of laugh, said, "Ay, ay? Why?"
 
"Because," returned the sergeant, clapping him on the shoulder, "youre
a man that knows whats what."
 
"Dye think so?" said Mr. Pumblechook, with his former laugh. "Have
another glass!"
 
"With you. Hob and nob," returned the sergeant. "The top of mine to the
foot of yours,the foot of yours to the top of mine,Ring once, ring
twice,the best tune on the Musical Glasses! Your health. May you live
a thousand years, and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you
are at the present moment of your life!"
 
The sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for
another glass. I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitality
appeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine, but took the
bottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a
gush of joviality. Even I got some. And he was so very free of the wine
that he even called for the other bottle, and handed that about with the
same liberality, when the first was gone.
 
As I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge,
enjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for
a dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was. They had not enjoyed
themselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightened
with the excitement he furnished. And now, when they were all in lively
anticipation of "the two villains" being taken, and when the bellows
seemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke
to hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them,
and all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the
blaze rose and sank, and the redhot sparks dropped and died, the pale
afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned
pale on their account, poor wretches.
 
At last, Joes job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped. As Joe
got on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of us should
go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt. Mr. Pumblechook
and Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies society but
Mr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would. Joe said he was agreeable,
and would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved. We never should have got leave
to go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joes curiosity to know all about it and
how it ended. As it was, she merely stipulated, "If you bring the boy
back with his head blown to bits by a musket, dont look to me to put it
together again."
 
The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr.
Pumblechook as from a comrade though I doubt if he were quite as fully
sensible of that gentlemans merits under arid conditions, as when
something moist was going. His men resumed their muskets and fell in.
Mr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and
to speak no word after we reached the marshes. When we were all out in
the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I treasonably
whispered to Joe, "I hope, Joe, we shant find them." and Joe whispered
to me, "Id give a shilling if they had cut and run, Pip."
 
We were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was
cold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming
on, and the people had good fires indoors and were keeping the day. A
few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came
out. We passed the fingerpost, and held straight on to the churchyard.
There we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeants
hand, while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the
graves, and also examined the porch. They came in again without finding
anything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate
at the side of the churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against us
here on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.
 
Now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little
thought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men
hiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should
come upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who
had brought the soldiers there? He had asked me if I was a deceiving
imp, and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the
hunt against him. Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in
treacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?
 
It was of no use asking myself this question now. There I was, on Joes
back, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a
hunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, and
to keep up with us. The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a
pretty wide line with an interval between man and man. We were taking
the course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.
Either the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it.
Under the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the
mound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain,
though all of a watery lead color.
 
With my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joes broad shoulder, I
looked all about for any sign of the convicts. I could see none, I could
hear none. Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by his
blowing and hard breathing but I knew the sounds by this time, and
could dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadful
start, when I thought I heard the file still going but it was only a
sheepbell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at
us and the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared
angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances but, except
these things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass,
there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.
 
The soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery, and we
were moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a sudden, we all
stopped. For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a
long shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, but
it was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raised
together,if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.
 
To this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under
their breath, when Joe and I came up. After another moments listening,
Joe who was a good judge agreed, and Mr. Wopsle who was a bad judge
agreed. The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should not
be answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his men
should make towards it "at the double." So we slanted to the right
where the East was, and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I had to
hold on tight to keep my seat.
 
It was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two words he
spoke all the time, "a Winder." Down banks and up banks, and over gates,
and splashing into dikes, and breaking among coarse rushes no man cared
where he went. As we came nearer to the shouting, it became more and
more apparent that it was made by more than one voice. Sometimes, it
seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped. When it broke
out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever, and we
after them. After a while, we had so run it down, that we could hear one
voice calling "Murder!" and another voice, "Convicts! Runaways! Guard!
This way for the runaway convicts!" Then both voices would seem to be
stifled in a struggle, and then would break out again. And when it had
come to this, the soldiers ran like deer, and Joe too.
 
The sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, and two
of his men ran in close upon him. Their pieces were cocked and levelled
when we all ran in.
 
"Here are both men!" panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of a
ditch. "Surrender, you two! and confound you for two wild beasts! Come
asunder!"
 
Water was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn, and
blows were being struck, when some more men went down into the ditch to
help the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict and the other
one. Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling but
of course I knew them both directly.
 
"Mind!" said my convict, wiping blood from his face with his ragged
sleeves, and shaking torn hair from his fingers "I took him! I give him
up to you! Mind that!"
 
"Its not much to be particular about," said the sergeant "itll do you
small good, my man, being in the same plight yourself. Handcuffs there!"
 
"I dont expect it to do me any good. I dont want it to do me more good
than it does now," said my convict, with a greedy laugh. "I took him. He
knows it. Thats enough for me."
 
The other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old
bruised left side of his face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.
He could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were both
separately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from
falling.
 
"Take notice, guard,he tried to murder me," were his first words.
 
"Tried to murder him?" said my convict, disdainfully. "Try, and not
do it? I took him, and giv him up thats what I done. I not only
prevented him getting off the marshes, but I dragged him here,dragged
him this far on his way back. Hes a gentleman, if you please, this
villain. Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me. Murder
him? Worth my while, too, to murder him, when I could do worse and drag
him back!"
 
The other one still gasped, "He triedhe triedtomurder me.
Bearbear witness."
 
"Lookee here!" said my convict to the sergeant. "Singlehanded I got
clear of the prisonship I made a dash and I done it. I could ha got
clear of these deathcold flats likewiselook at my leg you wont find
much iron on itif I hadnt made the discovery that he was here. Let
him go free? Let him profit by the means as I found out? Let him make a
tool of me afresh and again? Once more? No, no, no. If I had died at
the bottom there," and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his
manacled hands, "Id have held to him with that grip, that you should
have been safe to find him in my hold."
 
The other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of his
companion, repeated, "He tried to murder me. I should have been a dead
man if you had not come up."
 
"He lies!" said my convict, with fierce energy. "Hes a liar born, and
hell die a liar. Look at his face aint it written there? Let him turn
those eyes of his on me. I defy him to do it."
 
The other, with an effort at a scornful smile, which could not, however,
collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set expression, looked
at the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes and at the sky, but
certainly did not look at the speaker.
 
"Do you see him?" pursued my convict. "Do you see what a villain he is?
Do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes? Thats how he looked
when we were tried together. He never looked at me."
 
The other, always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes
restlessly about him far and near, did at last turn them for a moment on
the speaker, with the words, "You are not much to look at," and with
a halftaunting glance at the bound hands. At that point, my convict
became so frantically exasperated, that he would have rushed upon him
but for the interposition of the soldiers. "Didnt I tell you," said the
other convict then, "that he would murder me, if he could?" And any one
could see that he shook with fear, and that there broke out upon his
lips curious white flakes, like thin snow.
 
"Enough of this parley," said the sergeant. "Light those torches."
 
As one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, went down
on his knee to open it, my convict looked round him for the first time,
and saw me. I had alighted from Joes back on the brink of the ditch
when we came up, and had not moved since. I looked at him eagerly when
he looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head. I had
been waiting for him to see me that I might try to assure him of my
innocence. It was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended
my intention, for he gave me a look that I did not understand, and it
all passed in a moment. But if he had looked at me for an hour or for
a day, I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards, as having
been more attentive.
 
The soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four
torches, and took one himself and distributed the others. It had been
almost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards
very dark. Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in
a ring, fired twice into the air. Presently we saw other torches kindled
at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the opposite
bank of the river. "All right," said the sergeant. "March."
 
We had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a
sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. "You are expected
on board," said the sergeant to my convict "they know you are coming.
Dont straggle, my man. Close up here."
 
The two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate guard.
I had hold of Joes hand now, and Joe carried one of the torches. Mr.
Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to see it out, so
we went on with the party. There was a reasonably good path now, mostly
on the edge of the river, with a divergence here and there where a dike
came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluicegate. When
I looked round, I could see the other lights coming in after us. The
torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon the track, and
I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. I could see nothing
else but black darkness. Our lights warmed the air about us with their
pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that, as they
limped along in the midst of the muskets. We could not go fast, because
of their lameness and they were so spent, that two or three times we
had to halt while they rested.
 
After an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hut
and a landingplace. There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged,
and the sergeant answered. Then, we went into the hut, where there was
a smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and
a stand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an
overgrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about a dozen
soldiers all at once. Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their
greatcoats were not much interested in us, but just lifted their heads
and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again. The sergeant made some
kind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the convict whom I
call the other convict was drafted off with his guard, to go on board
first.
 
My convict never looked at me, except that once. While we stood in the
hut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up
his feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if
he pitied them for their recent adventures. Suddenly, he turned to the
sergeant, and remarked,
 
"I wish to say something respecting this escape. It may prevent some
persons laying under suspicion alonger me."
 
"You can say what you like," returned the sergeant, standing coolly
looking at him with his arms folded, "but you have no call to say it
here. Youll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear about it,
before its done with, you know."
 
"I know, but this is another pint, a separate matter. A man cant
starve at least I cant. I took some wittles, up at the willage over
yonder,where the church stands amost out on the marshes."
 
"You mean stole," said the sergeant.
 
"And Ill tell you where from. From the blacksmiths."
 
"Halloa!" said the sergeant, staring at Joe.
 
"Halloa, Pip!" said Joe, staring at me.
 
"It was some broken wittlesthats what it wasand a dram of liquor,
and a pie."
 
"Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?" asked
the sergeant, confidentially.
 
"My wife did, at the very moment when you came in. Dont you know, Pip?"
 
"So," said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and
without the least glance at me,"so youre the blacksmith, are you?
Than Im sorry to say, Ive eat your pie."
 
"God knows youre welcome to it,so far as it was ever mine," returned
Joe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe. "We dont know what you have
done, but we wouldnt have you starved to death for it, poor miserable
fellowcreatur.Would us, Pip?"
 
The something that I had noticed before, clicked in the mans throat
again, and he turned his back. The boat had returned, and his guard were
ready, so we followed him to the landingplace made of rough stakes
and stones, and saw him put into the boat, which was rowed by a crew of
convicts like himself. No one seemed surprised to see him, or interested
in seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, or spoke a word,
except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs, "Give way,
you!" which was the signal for the dip of the oars. By the light of the
torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from the mud of
the shore, like a wicked Noahs ark. Cribbed and barred and moored by
massive rusty chains, the prisonship seemed in my young eyes to be
ironed like the prisoners. We saw the boat go alongside, and we saw
him taken up the side and disappear. Then, the ends of the torches were
flung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all over with
him.
 
 
 
 
Chapter VI
 
My state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been so
unexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure but I hope
it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it.
 
I do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference
to Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me. But
I loved Joe,perhaps for no better reason in those early days than
because the dear fellow let me love him,and, as to him, my inner self
was not so easily composed. It was much upon my mind particularly when
I first saw him looking about for his file that I ought to tell Joe the
whole truth. Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrusted that
if I did, he would think me worse than I was. The fear of losing Joes
confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night
staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied up my
tongue. I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, I never
afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair whisker,
without thinking that he was meditating on it. That, if Joe knew it, I
never afterwards could see him glance, however casually, at yesterdays
meat or pudding when it came on todays table, without thinking that he
was debating whether I had been in the pantry. That, if Joe knew it, and
at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his
beer was flat or thick, the conviction that he suspected Tar in it,
would bring a rush of blood to my face. In a word, I was too cowardly
to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing
what I knew to be wrong. I had had no intercourse with the world at
that time, and I imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this
manner. Quite an untaught genius, I made the discovery of the line of
action for myself.
 
As I was sleepy before we were far away from the prisonship, Joe took
me on his back again and carried me home. He must have had a tiresome
journey of it, for Mr. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad
temper that if the Church had been thrown open, he would probably have
excommunicated the whole expedition, beginning with Joe and myself. In
his lay capacity, he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such
an insane extent, that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the
kitchen fire, the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have
hanged him, if it had been a capital offence.
 
By that time, I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little
drunkard, through having been newly set upon my feet, and through having
been fast asleep, and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of
tongues. As I came to myself with the aid of a heavy thump between the
shoulders, and the restorative exclamation "Yah! Was there ever such
a boy as this!" from my sister, I found Joe telling them about the
convicts confession, and all the visitors suggesting different ways
by which he had got into the pantry. Mr. Pumblechook made out, after
carefully surveying the premises, that he had first got upon the roof of
the forge, and had then got upon the roof of the house, and had then let
himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of his bedding cut
into strips and as Mr. Pumblechook was very positive and drove his
own chaisecartover Everybodyit was agreed that it must be so. Mr.
Wopsle, indeed, wildly cried out, "No!" with the feeble malice of a
tired man but, as he had no theory, and no coat on, he was unanimously
set at naught,not to mention his smoking hard behind, as he stood
with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out which was not
calculated to inspire confidence.
 
This was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me, as a
slumberous offence to the companys eyesight, and assisted me up to bed
with such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on, and to be
dangling them all against the edges of the stairs. My state of mind, as
I have described it, began before I was up in the morning, and lasted
long after the subject had died out, and had ceased to be mentioned
saving on exceptional occasions.
 
 
 
 
Chapter VII
 
At the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family
tombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out. My
construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for I
read "wife of the Above" as a complimentary reference to my fathers
exaltation to a better world and if any one of my deceased relations
had been referred to as "Below," I have no doubt I should have formed
the worst opinions of that member of the family. Neither were my notions
of the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me, at
all accurate for, I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my
declaration that I was to "walk in the same all the days of my life,"
laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our
house in one particular direction, and never to vary it by turning down
by the wheelwrights or up by the mill.
 
When I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until I could
assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called "Pompeyed," or
as I render it pampered. Therefore, I was not only oddboy about the
forge, but if any neighbor happened to want an extra boy to frighten
birds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I was favored with the
employment. In order, however, that our superior position might not be
compromised thereby, a moneybox was kept on the kitchen mantelshelf,
in to which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were
dropped. I have an impression that they were to be contributed
eventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt, but I know I
had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure.
 
Mr. Wopsles greataunt kept an evening school in the village that is
to say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited
infirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in
the society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the improving
opportunity of seeing her do it. She rented a small cottage, and Mr.
Wopsle had the room up stairs, where we students used to overhear him
reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and occasionally
bumping on the ceiling. There was a fiction that Mr. Wopsle "examined"
the scholars once a quarter. What he did on those occasions was to turn
up his cuffs, stick up his hair, and give us Mark Antonys oration over
the body of Caesar. This was always followed by Collinss Ode on
the Passions, wherein I particularly venerated Mr. Wopsle as Revenge
throwing his bloodstained sword in thunder down, and taking the
Wardenouncing trumpet with a withering look. It was not with me then,
as it was in later life, when I fell into the society of the Passions,
and compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to the disadvantage of
both gentlemen.
 
Mr. Wopsles greataunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution,
kept in the same rooma little general shop. She had no idea what stock
she had, or what the price of anything in it was but there was a little
greasy memorandumbook kept in a drawer, which served as a Catalogue
of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop transaction.
Biddy was Mr. Wopsles greataunts granddaughter I confess myself
quiet unequal to the working out of the problem, what relation she was
to Mr. Wopsle. She was an orphan like myself like me, too, had been
brought up by hand. She was most noticeable, I thought, in respect of
her extremities for, her hair always wanted brushing, her hands always
wanted washing, and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at
heel. This description must be received with a weekday limitation. On
Sundays, she went to church elaborated.
 
Much of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr.
Wopsles greataunt, I struggled through the alphabet as if it had been
a bramblebush getting considerably worried and scratched by every
letter. After that I fell among those thieves, the nine figures, who
seemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and
baffle recognition. But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, to
read, write, and cipher, on the very smallest scale.
 
One night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expending
great efforts on the production of a letter to Joe. I think it must have
been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was a long
time after, and it was winter and a hard frost. With an alphabet on the
hearth at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or two to print
and smear this epistle
 
"MI DEER JO i OPE U R KR WITE WELL i OPE i SHAL SON B HABELL 4 2 TEEDGE
U JO AN THEN WE SHORL B SO GLODD AN WEN i M PRENGTD 2 U JO WOT LARX AN
BLEVE ME INF XN PIP."
 
There was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe by
letter, inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone. But I delivered
this written communication slate and all with my own hand, and Joe
received it as a miracle of erudition.
 
"I say, Pip, old chap!" cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, "what a
scholar you are! Ant you?"
 
"I should like to be," said I, glancing at the slate as he held it with
a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.
 
"Why, heres a J," said Joe, "and a O equal to anythink! Heres a J and
a O, Pip, and a JO, Joe."
 
I had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this
monosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when I
accidentally held our PrayerBook upside down, that it seemed to suit
his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. Wishing to
embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, I
should have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, "Ah! But read the
rest, Jo."
 
"The rest, eh, Pip?" said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searching eye,
"One, two, three. Why, heres three Js, and three Os, and three JO,
Joes in it, Pip!"
 
I leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger read him the whole
letter.
 
"Astonishing!" said Joe, when I had finished. "You ARE a scholar."
 
"How do you spell Gargery, Joe?" I asked him, with a modest patronage.
 
"I dont spell it at all," said Joe.
 
"But supposing you did?"
 
"It cant be supposed," said Joe. "Tho Im uncommon fond of reading,
too."
 
"Are you, Joe?"
 
"Oncommon. Give me," said Joe, "a good book, or a good newspaper, and
sit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better. Lord!" he continued,
after rubbing his knees a little, "when you do come to a J and a O, and
says you, Here, at last, is a JO, Joe, how interesting reading is!"
 
I derived from this, that Joes education, like Steam, was yet in its
infancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired,
 
"Didnt you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?"
 
"No, Pip."
 
"Why didnt you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?"
 
"Well, Pip," said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to
his usual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire
between the lower bars "Ill tell you. My father, Pip, he were given
to drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at
my mother, most onmerciful. It were amost the only hammering he did,
indeed, xcepting at myself. And he hammered at me with a wigor only
to be equalled by the wigor with which he didnt hammer at his
anwil.Youre a listening and understanding, Pip?"
 
"Yes, Joe."
 
"Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several
times and then my mother shed go out to work, and shed say, "Joe,"
shed say, "now, please God, you shall have some schooling, child," and
shed put me to school. But my father were that good in his hart that
he couldnt abear to be without us. So, hed come with a most tremenjous
crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where we was, that
they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us
up to him. And then he took us home and hammered us. Which, you see,
Pip," said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of the fire, and
looking at me, "were a drawback on my learning."
 
"Certainly, poor Joe!"
 
"Though mind you, Pip," said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of the
poker on the top bar, "rendering unto all their doo, and maintaining
equal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in his hart,
dont you see?"
 
I didnt see but I didnt say so.
 
"Well!" Joe pursued, "somebody must keep the pot a biling, Pip, or the
pot wont bile, dont you know?"
 
I saw that, and said so.
 
"Consequence, my father didnt make objections to my going to work so
I went to work at my present calling, which were his too, if he
would have followed it, and I worked tolerable hard, I assure you, Pip.
In time I were able to keep him, and I kep him till he went off in a
purple leptic fit. And it were my intentions to have had put upon his
tombstone that, Whatsumeer the failings on his part, Remember reader he
were that good in his heart."
 
Joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful
perspicuity, that I asked him if he had made it himself.
 
"I made it," said Joe, "my own self. I made it in a moment. It was like
striking out a horseshoe complete, in a single blow. I never was so much
surprised in all my life,couldnt credit my own ed,to tell you the
truth, hardly believed it were my own ed. As I was saying, Pip, it were
my intentions to have had it cut over him but poetry costs money, cut
it how you will, small or large, and it were not done. Not to mention
bearers, all the money that could be spared were wanted for my mother.
She were in poor elth, and quite broke. She werent long of following,
poor soul, and her share of peace come round at last."
 
Joes blue eyes turned a little watery he rubbed first one of them, and
then the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner, with the
round knob on the top of the poker.
 
"It were but lonesome then," said Joe, "living here alone, and I got
acquainted with your sister. Now, Pip,"Joe looked firmly at me as
if he knew I was not going to agree with him"your sister is a fine
figure of a woman."
 
I could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt.
 
"Whatever family opinions, or whatever the worlds opinions, on that
subject may be, Pip, your sister is," Joe tapped the top bar with the
poker after every word following, "afinefigureofawoman!"
 
I could think of nothing better to say than "I am glad you think so,
Joe."
 
"So am I," returned Joe, catching me up. "I am glad I think so, Pip. A
little redness or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what does it
signify to Me?"
 
I sagaciously observed, if it didnt signify to him, to whom did it
signify?
 
"Certainly!" assented Joe. "Thats it. Youre right, old chap! When I
got acquainted with your sister, it were the talk how she was bringing
you up by hand. Very kind of her too, all the folks said, and I said,
along with all the folks. As to you," Joe pursued with a countenance
expressive of seeing something very nasty indeed, "if you could have
been aware how small and flabby and mean you was, dear me, youd have
formed the most contemptible opinion of yourself!"
 
Not exactly relishing this, I said, "Never mind me, Joe."
 
"But I did mind you, Pip," he returned with tender simplicity. "When
I offered to your sister to keep company, and to be asked in church at
such times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge, I said to
her, And bring the poor little child. God bless the poor little child,
I said to your sister, theres room for him at the forge!"
 
I broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck
who dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, "Ever the best of friends
ant us, Pip? Dont cry, old chap!"
 
When this little interruption was over, Joe resumed
 
"Well, you see, Pip, and here we are! Thats about where it lights here
we are! Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip and I tell
you beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull, Mrs. Joe mustnt see
too much of what were up to. It must be done, as I may say, on the sly.
And why on the sly? Ill tell you why, Pip."
 
He had taken up the poker again without which, I doubt if he could have
proceeded in his demonstration.
 
"Your sister is given to government."
 
"Given to government, Joe?" I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea
and I am afraid I must add, hope that Joe had divorced her in a favor
of the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.
 
"Given to government," said Joe. "Which I meantersay the government of
you and myself."
 
"Oh!"
 
"And she ant over partial to having scholars on the premises," Joe
continued, "and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a
scholar, for fear as I might rise. Like a sort of rebel, dont you see?"
 
I was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as "Why"
when Joe stopped me.
 
"Stay a bit. I know what youre a going to say, Pip stay a bit! I dont
deny that your sister comes the Mogul over us, now and again. I dont
deny that she do throw us backfalls, and that she do drop down upon us
heavy. At such times as when your sister is on the Rampage, Pip," Joe
sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, "candor compels fur
to admit that she is a Buster."
 
Joe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capital
Bs.
 
"Why dont I rise? That were your observation when I broke it off, Pip?"
 
"Yes, Joe."
 
"Well," said Joe, passing the poker into his left hand, that he might
feel his whisker and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that
placid occupation "your sisters a mastermind. A mastermind."
 
"Whats that?" I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand. But
Joe was readier with his definition than I had expected, and completely
stopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look,
"Her."
 
"And I aint a mastermind," Joe resumed, when he had unfixed his look,
and got back to his whisker. "And last of all, Pip,and this I want to
say very serious to you, old chap,I see so much in my poor mother,
of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never
getting no peace in her mortal days, that Im dead afeerd of going wrong
in the way of not doing whats right by a woman, and Id fur rather
of the two go wrong the tother way, and be a little illconwenienced
myself. I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip I wish there warnt
no Tickler for you, old chap I wish I could take it all on myself
but this is the upanddownandstraight on it, Pip, and I hope youll
overlook shortcomings."
 
Young as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from that
night. We were equals afterwards, as we had been before but, afterwards
at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about him, I had
a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up to Joe in my
heart.
 
"However," said Joe, rising to replenish the fire "heres the
Dutchclock a working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of em,
and shes not come home yet! I hope Uncle Pumblechooks mare maynt have
set a forefoot on a piece o ice, and gone down."
 
Mrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on marketdays,
to assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a
womans judgment Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no
confidences in his domestic servant. This was marketday, and Mrs. Joe
was out on one of these expeditions.
 
Joe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door to
listen for the chaisecart. It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew
keenly, and the frost was white and hard. A man would die tonight of
lying out on the marshes, I thought. And then I looked at the stars, and
considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to them
as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering
multitude.
 
"Here comes the mare," said Joe, "ringing like a peal of bells!"
 
The sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, as she
came along at a much brisker trot than usual. We got a chair out, ready
for Mrs. Joes alighting, and stirred up the fire that they might see a
bright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might
be out of its place. When we had completed these preparations, they
drove up, wrapped to the eyes. Mrs. Joe was soon landed, and Uncle
Pumblechook was soon down too, covering the mare with a cloth, and we
were soon all in the kitchen, carrying so much cold air in with us that
it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire.
 
"Now," said Mrs. Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excitement, and
throwing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings,
"if this boy aint grateful this night, he never will be!"
 
I looked as grateful as any boy possibly could, who was wholly
uninformed why he ought to assume that expression.
 
"Its only to be hoped," said my sister, "that he wont be Pompeyed. But
I have my fears."
 
"She aint in that line, Mum," said Mr. Pumblechook. "She knows better."
 
She? I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows,
"She?" Joe looked at me, making the motion with his lips and eyebrows,
"She?" My sister catching him in the act, he drew the back of his hand
across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such occasions, and
looked at her.
 
"Well?" said my sister, in her snappish way. "What are you staring at?
Is the house afire?"
 
"Which some individual," Joe politely hinted, "mentionedshe."
 
"And she is a she, I suppose?" said my sister. "Unless you call Miss
Havisham a he. And I doubt if even youll go so far as that."
 
"Miss Havisham, up town?" said Joe.
 
"Is there any Miss Havisham down town?" returned my sister.
 
"She wants this boy to go and play there. And of course hes going. And
he had better play there," said my sister, shaking her head at me as an
encouragement to be extremely light and sportive, "or Ill work him."
 
I had heard of Miss Havisham up town,everybody for miles round had
heard of Miss Havisham up town,as an immensely rich and grim lady who
lived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers, and who
led a life of seclusion.
 
"Well to be sure!" said Joe, astounded. "I wonder how she come to know
Pip!"
 
"Noodle!" cried my sister. "Who said she knew him?"
 
"Which some individual," Joe again politely hinted, "mentioned that
she wanted him to go and play there."
 
"And couldnt she ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and
play there? Isnt it just barely possible that Uncle Pumblechook may be
a tenant of hers, and that he may sometimeswe wont say quarterly
or halfyearly, for that would be requiring too much of youbut
sometimesgo there to pay his rent? And couldnt she then ask Uncle
Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there? And couldnt Uncle
Pumblechook, being always considerate and thoughtful for usthough you
may not think it, Joseph," in a tone of the deepest reproach, as if
he were the most callous of nephews, "then mention this boy, standing
Prancing here"which I solemnly declare I was not doing"that I have
for ever been a willing slave to?"
 
"Good again!" cried Uncle Pumblechook. "Well put! Prettily pointed! Good
indeed! Now Joseph, you know the case."
 
"No, Joseph," said my sister, still in a reproachful manner, while Joe
apologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose,
"you do not yetthough you may not think itknow the case. You may
consider that you do, but you do not, Joseph. For you do not know that
Uncle Pumblechook, being sensible that for anything we can tell, this
boys fortune may be made by his going to Miss Havishams, has offered
to take him into town tonight in his own chaisecart, and to keep
him tonight, and to take him with his own hands to Miss Havishams
tomorrow morning. And Loramussy me!" cried my sister, casting off her
bonnet in sudden desperation, "here I stand talking to mere Mooncalfs,
with Uncle Pumblechook waiting, and the mare catching cold at the door,
and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair of his head to the
sole of his foot!"
 
With that, she pounced upon me, like an eagle on a lamb, and my face was
squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks, and my head was put under taps of
waterbutts, and I was soaped, and kneaded, and towelled, and thumped,
and harrowed, and rasped, until I really was quite beside myself. I
may here remark that I suppose myself to be better acquainted than
any living authority, with the ridgy effect of a weddingring, passing
unsympathetically over the human countenance.
 
When my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of the
stiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and was
trussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit. I was then delivered
over to Mr. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he were the
Sheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had been
dying to make all along "Boy, be forever grateful to all friends, but
especially unto them which brought you up by hand!"
 
"Goodbye, Joe!"
 
"God bless you, Pip, old chap!"
 
I had never parted from him before, and what with my feelings and what
with soapsuds, I could at first see no stars from the chaisecart.
But they twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light on the
questions why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havishams, and what
on earth I was expected to play at.
 
 
 
 
Chapter VIII
 
Mr. Pumblechooks premises in the High Street of the market town,
were of a peppercorny and farinaceous character, as the premises of a
cornchandler and seedsman should be. It appeared to me that he must be a
very happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his shop and
I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and saw the
tiedup brown paper packets inside, whether the flowerseeds and bulbs
ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and bloom.
 
It was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this
speculation. On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed in
an attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the
bedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my
eyebrows. In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity
between seeds and corduroys. Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did
his shopman and somehow, there was a general air and flavor about the
corduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and flavor
about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I hardly knew
which was which. The same opportunity served me for noticing that Mr.
Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the
street at the saddler, who appeared to transact his business by keeping
his eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to get on in life by putting his
hands in his pockets and contemplating the baker, who in his turn folded
his arms and stared at the grocer, who stood at his door and yawned at
the chemist. The watchmaker, always poring over a little desk with
a magnifyingglass at his eye, and always inspected by a group of
smockfrocks poring over him through the glass of his shopwindow,
seemed to be about the only person in the High Street whose trade
engaged his attention.
 
Mr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight oclock in the parlor behind
the shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of bread
and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I considered Mr.
Pumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by my sisters
idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted
to my diet,besides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination
with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm water into
my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out
altogether,his conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic. On
my politely bidding him Good morning, he said, pompously, "Seven times
nine, boy?" And how should I be able to answer, dodged in that way, in
a strange place, on an empty stomach! I was hungry, but before I had
swallowed a morsel, he began a running sum that lasted all through the
breakfast. "Seven?" "And four?" "And eight?" "And six?" "And two?" "And
ten?" And so on. And after each figure was disposed of, it was as much
as I could do to get a bite or a sup, before the next came while he sat
at his ease guessing nothing, and eating bacon and hot roll, in if I
may be allowed the expression a gorging and gormandizing manner.
 
For such reasons, I was very glad when ten oclock came and we started
for Miss Havishams though I was not at all at my ease regarding the
manner in which I should acquit myself under that ladys roof. Within
a quarter of an hour we came to Miss Havishams house, which was of old
brick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it. Some of the
windows had been walled up of those that remained, all the lower were
rustily barred. There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred so
we had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come
to open it. While we waited at the gate, I peeped in even then Mr.
Pumblechook said, "And fourteen?" but I pretended not to hear him, and
saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery. No brewing
was going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long long
time.
 
A window was raised, and a clear voice demanded "What name?" To which my
conductor replied, "Pumblechook." The voice returned, "Quite right," and
the window was shut again, and a young lady came across the courtyard,
with keys in her hand.
 
"This," said Mr. Pumblechook, "is Pip."
 
"This is Pip, is it?" returned the young lady, who was very pretty and
seemed very proud "come in, Pip."
 
Mr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she stopped him with the gate.
 
"Oh!" she said. "Did you wish to see Miss Havisham?"
 
"If Miss Havisham wished to see me," returned Mr. Pumblechook,
discomfited.
 
"Ah!" said the girl "but you see she dont."
 
She said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr.
Pumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not
protest. But he eyed me severely,as if I had done anything to
him!and departed with the words reproachfully delivered "Boy! Let
your behavior here be a credit unto them which brought you up by hand!"
I was not free from apprehension that he would come back to propound
through the gate, "And sixteen?" But he didnt.
 
My young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard.
It was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice. The
brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and the
wooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stood
open, away to the high enclosing wall and all was empty and disused.
The cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate and
it made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the
brewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea.
 
She saw me looking at it, and she said, "You could drink without hurt
all the strong beer thats brewed there now, boy."
 
"I should think I could, miss," said I, in a shy way.
 
"Better not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour, boy
dont you think so?"
 
"It looks like it, miss."
 
"Not that anybody means to try," she added, "for thats all done with,
and the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls. As to strong
beer, theres enough of it in the cellars already, to drown the Manor
House."
 
"Is that the name of this house, miss?"
 
"One of its names, boy."
 
"It has more than one, then, miss?"
 
"One more. Its other name was Satis which is Greek, or Latin, or
Hebrew, or all threeor all one to mefor enough."
 
"Enough House," said I "thats a curious name, miss."
 
"Yes," she replied "but it meant more than it said. It meant, when it
was given, that whoever had this house could want nothing else. They
must have been easily satisfied in those days, I should think. But dont
loiter, boy."
 
Though she called me "boy" so often, and with a carelessness that was
far from complimentary, she was of about my own age. She seemed much
older than I, of course, being a girl, and beautiful and selfpossessed
and she was as scornful of me as if she had been oneandtwenty, and a
queen.
 
We went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had two
chains across it outside,and the first thing I noticed was, that the
passages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there.
She took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase,
and still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.
 
At last we came to the door of a room, and she said, "Go in."
 
I answered, more in shyness than politeness, "After you, miss."
 
To this she returned "Dont be ridiculous, boy I am not going in." And
scornfully walked away, andwhat was worsetook the candle with her.
 
This was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. However, the only
thing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told
from within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a pretty
large room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse of daylight was to
be seen in it. It was a dressingroom, as I supposed from the furniture,
though much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me. But
prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded lookingglass, and that
I made out at first sight to be a fine ladys dressingtable.
 
Whether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no
fine lady sitting at it, I cannot say. In an armchair, with an
elbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat the
strangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.
 
She was dressed in rich materials,satins, and lace, and silks,all
of white. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependent
from her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was
white. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and
some other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid
than the dress she wore, and halfpacked trunks, were scattered about.
She had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on,the
other was on the table near her hand,her veil was but half arranged,
her watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom lay
with those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and
some flowers, and a PrayerBook all confusedly heaped about the
lookingglass.
 
It was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though
I saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But I
saw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been
white long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw
that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and
like the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her
sunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure
of a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had
shrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly
waxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage
lying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches
to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of
a vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to
have dark eyes that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, if
I could.
 
"Who is it?" said the lady at the table.
 
"Pip, maam."
 
"Pip?"
 
"Mr. Pumblechooks boy, maam. Cometo play."
 
"Come nearer let me look at you. Come close."
 
It was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note of
the surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stopped
at twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at
twenty minutes to nine.
 
"Look at me," said Miss Havisham. "You are not afraid of a woman who has
never seen the sun since you were born?"
 
I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie
comprehended in the answer "No."
 
"Do you know what I touch here?" she said, laying her hands, one upon
the other, on her left side.
 
"Yes, maam." It made me think of the young man.
 
"What do I touch?"
 
"Your heart."
 
"Broken!"
 
She uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and
with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards she kept
her hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if they
were heavy.
 
"I am tired," said Miss Havisham. "I want diversion, and I have done
with men and women. Play."
 
I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she
could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide
world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.
 
"I sometimes have sick fancies," she went on, "and I have a sick fancy
that I want to see some play. There, there!" with an impatient movement
of the fingers of her right hand "play, play, play!"
 
For a moment, with the fear of my sisters working me before my eyes, I
had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character
of Mr. Pumblechooks chaisecart. But I felt myself so unequal to the
performance that I gave it up, and stood looking at Miss Havisham in
what I suppose she took for a dogged manner, inasmuch as she said, when
we had taken a good look at each other,
 
"Are you sullen and obstinate?"
 
"No, maam, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I cant play just
now. If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, so
I would do it if I could but its so new here, and so strange, and so
fine,and melancholy." I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or
had already said it, and we took another look at each other.
 
Before she spoke again, she turned her eyes from me, and looked at the
dress she wore, and at the dressingtable, and finally at herself in the
lookingglass.
 
"So new to him," she muttered, "so old to me so strange to him, so
familiar to me so melancholy to both of us! Call Estella."
 
As she was still looking at the reflection of herself, I thought she was
still talking to herself, and kept quiet.
 
"Call Estella," she repeated, flashing a look at me. "You can do that.
Call Estella. At the door."
 
To stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house,
bawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive,
and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name, was almost
as bad as playing to order. But she answered at last, and her light came
along the dark passage like a star.
 
Miss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel from the
table, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her
pretty brown hair. "Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use it
well. Let me see you play cards with this boy."
 
"With this boy? Why, he is a common laboring boy!"
 
I thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer,only it seemed so
unlikely,"Well? You can break his heart."
 
"What do you play, boy?" asked Estella of myself, with the greatest
disdain.
 
"Nothing but beggar my neighbor, miss."
 
"Beggar him," said Miss Havisham to Estella. So we sat down to cards.
 
It was then I began to understand that everything in the room had
stopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago. I noticed that
Miss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had
taken it up. As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the dressingtable
again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now yellow, had never
been worn. I glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent,
and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now yellow, had been
trodden ragged. Without this arrest of everything, this standing still
of all the pale decayed objects, not even the withered bridal dress on
the collapsed form could have looked so like graveclothes, or the long
veil so like a shroud.
 
So she sat, corpselike, as we played at cards the frillings and
trimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I knew nothing
then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in
ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly
seen but, I have often thought since, that she must have looked as if
the admission of the natural light of day would have struck her to dust.
 
"He calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!" said Estella with disdain, before
our first game was out. "And what coarse hands he has! And what thick
boots!"
 
I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before but I began
to consider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was so
strong, that it became infectious, and I caught it.
 
She won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as was only natural, when I
knew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong and she denounced me for
a stupid, clumsy laboringboy.
 
"You say nothing of her," remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she looked
on. "She says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her. What
do you think of her?"
 
"I dont like to say," I stammered.
 
"Tell me in my ear," said Miss Havisham, bending down.
 
"I think she is very proud," I replied, in a whisper.
 
"Anything else?"
 
"I think she is very pretty."
 
"Anything else?"
 
"I think she is very insulting." She was looking at me then with a look
of supreme aversion.
 
"Anything else?"
 
"I think I should like to go home."
 
"And never see her again, though she is so pretty?"
 
"I am not sure that I shouldnt like to see her again, but I should like
to go home now."
 
"You shall go soon," said Miss Havisham, aloud. "Play the game out."
 
Saving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost
sure that Miss Havishams face could not smile. It had dropped into a
watchful and brooding expression,most likely when all the things about
her had become transfixed,and it looked as if nothing could ever lift
it up again. Her chest had dropped, so that she stooped and her voice
had dropped, so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her
altogether, she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul,
within and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.
 
I played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me. She
threw the cards down on the table when she had won them all, as if she
despised them for having been won of me.
 
"When shall I have you here again?" said Miss Havisham. "Let me think."
 
I was beginning to remind her that today was Wednesday, when she
checked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her
right hand.
 
"There, there! I know nothing of days of the week I know nothing of
weeks of the year. Come again after six days. You hear?"
 
"Yes, maam."
 
"Estella, take him down. Let him have something to eat, and let him roam
and look about him while he eats. Go, Pip."
 
I followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and she
stood it in the place where we had found it. Until she opened the
side entrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must
necessarily be nighttime. The rush of the daylight quite confounded me,
and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange room
many hours.
 
"You are to wait here, you boy," said Estella and disappeared and
closed the door.
 
I took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my
coarse hands and my common boots. My opinion of those accessories was
not favorable. They had never troubled me before, but they troubled
me now, as vulgar appendages. I determined to ask Joe why he had ever
taught me to call those picturecards Jacks, which ought to be called
knaves. I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, and then
I should have been so too.
 
She came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer. She
put the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread
and meat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in
disgrace. I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,I
cannot hit upon the right name for the smartGod knows what its name
was,that tears started to my eyes. The moment they sprang there, the
girl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them.
This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her so, she gave a
contemptuous tossbut with a sense, I thought, of having made too sure
that I was so woundedand left me.
 
But when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face
in, and got behind one of the gates in the brewerylane, and leaned my
sleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.
As I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair so
bitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name, that
needed counteraction.
 
My sisters bringing up had made me sensitive. In the little world in
which children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is
nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice. It may be
only small injustice that the child can be exposed to but the child
is small, and its world is small, and its rockinghorse stands as many
hands high, according to scale, as a bigboned Irish hunter. Within
myself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with
injustice. I had known, from the time when I could speak, that my
sister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me. I had
cherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave her
no right to bring me up by jerks. Through all my punishments, disgraces,
fasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I had nursed
this assurance and to my communing so much with it, in a solitary and
unprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I was morally timid
and very sensitive.
 
I got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the
brewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my
face with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate. The bread and meat
were acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soon
in spirits to look about me.
 
To be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeonhouse in the
breweryyard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high
wind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there
had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But there were no pigeons
in the dovecot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty, no malt in
the storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat.
All the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its
last reek of smoke. In a byyard, there was a wilderness of empty casks,
which had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about
them but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that
was gone,and in this respect I remember those recluses as being like
most others.
 
Behind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old
wall not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough
to look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the
house, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was
a track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes walked
there, and that Estella was walking away from me even then. But she
seemed to be everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptation presented
by the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw her walking on them at
the end of the yard of casks. She had her back towards me, and held her
pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and never looked round,
and passed out of my view directly. So, in the brewery itself,by which
I mean the large paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer,
and where the brewing utensils still were. When I first went into it,
and, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near the door looking about
me, I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, and ascend some light
iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead, as if she were going
out into the sky.
 
It was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened
to my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a
stranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyesa little dimmed by
looking up at the frosty lighttowards a great wooden beam in a low
nook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure
hanging there by the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but
one shoe to the feet and it hung so, that I could see that the faded
trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was
Miss Havishams, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if
she were trying to call to me. In the terror of seeing the figure,
and in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment
before, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it. And my terror
was greatest of all when I found no figure there.
 
Nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of
people passing beyond the bars of the courtyard gate, and the reviving
influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have brought
me round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself as soon
as I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, to let
me out. She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I
thought, if she saw me frightened and she would have no fair reason.
 
She gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she rejoiced that
my hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she opened the
gate, and stood holding it. I was passing out without looking at her,
when she touched me with a taunting hand.
 
"Why dont you cry?"
 
"Because I dont want to."
 
"You do," said she. "You have been crying till you are half blind, and
you are near crying again now."
 
She laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me.
I went straight to Mr. Pumblechooks, and was immensely relieved to find
him not at home. So, leaving word with the shopman on what day I was
wanted at Miss Havishams again, I set off on the fourmile walk to
our forge pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply
revolving that I was a common laboringboy that my hands were coarse
that my boots were thick that I had fallen into a despicable habit
of calling knaves Jacks that I was much more ignorant than I had
considered myself last night, and generally that I was in a lowlived
bad way.
 
 
 
 
Chapter IX
 
When I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about Miss
Havishams, and asked a number of questions. And I soon found myself
getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small
of the back, and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen
wall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficient length.
 
If a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other
young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden
in mine,which I consider probable, as I have no particular reason
to suspect myself of having been a monstrosity,it is the key to many
reservations. I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havishams as my
eyes had seen it, I should not be understood. Not only that, but I felt
convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood and although
she was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an impression
that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging
her as she really was to say nothing of Miss Estella before the
contemplation of Mrs. Joe. Consequently, I said as little as I could,
and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall.
 
The worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed upon by
a devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, came
gaping over in his chaisecart at teatime, to have the details divulged
to him. And the mere sight of the torment, with his fishy eyes and mouth
open, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his waistcoat heaving
with windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.
 
"Well, boy," Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he was seated in the
chair of honor by the fire. "How did you get on up town?"
 
I answered, "Pretty well, sir," and my sister shook her fist at me.
 
"Pretty well?" Mr. Pumblechook repeated. "Pretty well is no answer. Tell
us what you mean by pretty well, boy?"
 
Whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy
perhaps. Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, my
obstinacy was adamantine. I reflected for some time, and then answered
as if I had discovered a new idea, "I mean pretty well."
 
My sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,I
had no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,when Mr.
Pumblechook interposed with "No! Dont lose your temper. Leave this
lad to me, maam leave this lad to me." Mr. Pumblechook then turned me
towards him, as if he were going to cut my hair, and said,
 
"First to get our thoughts in order Fortythree pence?"
 
I calculated the consequences of replying "Four Hundred Pound," and
finding them against me, went as near the answer as I couldwhich was
somewhere about eightpence off. Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my
pencetable from "twelve pence make one shilling," up to "forty pence
make three and fourpence," and then triumphantly demanded, as if he had
done for me, "Now! How much is fortythree pence?" To which I replied,
after a long interval of reflection, "I dont know." And I was so
aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know.
 
Mr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me,
and said, "Is fortythree pence seven and sixpence three fardens, for
instance?"
 
"Yes!" said I. And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it was
highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke, and
brought him to a dead stop.
 
"Boy! What like is Miss Havisham?" Mr. Pumblechook began again when
he had recovered folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the
screw.
 
"Very tall and dark," I told him.
 
"Is she, uncle?" asked my sister.
 
Mr. Pumblechook winked assent from which I at once inferred that he had
never seen Miss Havisham, for she was nothing of the kind.
 
"Good!" said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly. "This is the way to have him!
We are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?"
 
"I am sure, uncle," returned Mrs. Joe, "I wish you had him always you
know so well how to deal with him."
 
"Now, boy! What was she a doing of, when you went in today?" asked Mr.
Pumblechook.
 
"She was sitting," I answered, "in a black velvet coach."
 
Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one anotheras they well
mightand both repeated, "In a black velvet coach?"
 
"Yes," said I. "And Miss Estellathats her niece, I thinkhanded her
in cake and wine at the coachwindow, on a gold plate. And we all had
cake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the coach to eat mine,
because she told me to."
 
"Was anybody else there?" asked Mr. Pumblechook.
 
"Four dogs," said I.
 
"Large or small?"
 
"Immense," said I. "And they fought for vealcutlets out of a silver
basket."
 
Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utter
amazement. I was perfectly frantic,a reckless witness under the
torture,and would have told them anything.
 
"Where was this coach, in the name of gracious?" asked my sister.
 
"In Miss Havishams room." They stared again. "But there werent any
horses to it." I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejecting
four richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of
harnessing.
 
"Can this be possible, uncle?" asked Mrs. Joe. "What can the boy mean?"
 
"Ill tell you, Mum," said Mr. Pumblechook. "My opinion is, its a
sedanchair. Shes flighty, you know,very flighty,quite flighty
enough to pass her days in a sedanchair."
 
"Did you ever see her in it, uncle?" asked Mrs. Joe.
 
"How could I," he returned, forced to the admission, "when I never see
her in my life? Never clapped eyes upon her!"
 
"Goodness, uncle! And yet you have spoken to her?"
 
"Why, dont you know," said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, "that when I have
been there, I have been took up to the outside of her door, and the door
has stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way. Dont say you dont
know that, Mum. Howsever, the boy went there to play. What did you play
at, boy?"
 
"We played with flags," I said. I beg to observe that I think of myself
with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.
 
"Flags!" echoed my sister.
 
"Yes," said I. "Estella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and
Miss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out
at the coachwindow. And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed."
 
"Swords!" repeated my sister. "Where did you get swords from?"
 
"Out of a cupboard," said I. "And I saw pistols in it,and jam,and
pills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted up
with candles."
 
"Thats true, Mum," said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod. "Thats the
state of the case, for that much Ive seen myself." And then they
both stared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my
countenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trousers
with my right hand.
 
If they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly have
betrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning that
there was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statement
but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear
in the brewery. They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the
marvels I had already presented for their consideration, that I escaped.
The subject still held them when Joe came in from his work to have a cup
of tea. To whom my sister, more for the relief of her own mind than for
the gratification of his, related my pretended experiences.
 
Now, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the
kitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence but only as
regarded him,not in the least as regarded the other two. Towards
Joe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat
debating what results would come to me from Miss Havishams acquaintance
and favor. They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would "do something"
for me their doubts related to the form that something would take.
My sister stood out for "property." Mr. Pumblechook was in favor of a
handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel trade,say,
the corn and seed trade, for instance. Joe fell into the deepest
disgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I might only
be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the vealcutlets.
"If a fools head cant express better opinions than that," said my
sister, "and you have got any work to do, you had better go and do it."
So he went.
 
After Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was washing up,
I stole into the forge to Joe, and remained by him until he had done for
the night. Then I said, "Before the fire goes out, Joe, I should like to
tell you something."
 
"Should you, Pip?" said Joe, drawing his shoeingstool near the forge.
"Then tell us. What is it, Pip?"
 
"Joe," said I, taking hold of his rolledup shirt sleeve, and twisting
it between my finger and thumb, "you remember all that about Miss
Havishams?"
 
"Remember?" said Joe. "I believe you! Wonderful!"
 
"Its a terrible thing, Joe it aint true."
 
"What are you telling of, Pip?" cried Joe, falling back in the greatest
amazement. "You dont mean to say its"
 
"Yes I do its lies, Joe."
 
"But not all of it? Why sure you dont mean to say, Pip, that there was
no black welwet coch?" For, I stood shaking my head. "But at least
there was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip," said Joe, persuasively, "if there
warnt no wealcutlets, at least there was dogs?"
 
"No, Joe."
 
"A dog?" said Joe. "A puppy? Come?"
 
"No, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind."
 
As I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.
"Pip, old chap! This wont do, old fellow! I say! Where do you expect to
go to?"
 
"Its terrible, Joe aint it?"
 
"Terrible?" cried Joe. "Awful! What possessed you?"
 
"I dont know what possessed me, Joe," I replied, letting his shirt
sleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head
"but I wish you hadnt taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks and I
wish my boots werent so thick nor my hands so coarse."
 
And then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadnt been
able to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to
me, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havishams
who was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that I
knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the lies
had come of it somehow, though I didnt know how.
 
This was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal
with as for me. But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of
metaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.
 
"Theres one thing you may be sure of, Pip," said Joe, after some
rumination, "namely, that lies is lies. Howsever they come, they didnt
ought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round to
the same. Dont you tell no more of em, Pip. That aint the way to get
out of being common, old chap. And as to being common, I dont make
it out at all clear. You are oncommon in some things. Youre oncommon
small. Likewise youre a oncommon scholar."
 
"No, I am ignorant and backward, Joe."
 
"Why, see what a letter you wrote last night! Wrote in print even! Ive
seen lettersAh! and from gentlefolks!that Ill swear werent wrote
in print," said Joe.
 
"I have learnt next to nothing, Joe. You think much of me. Its only
that."
 
"Well, Pip," said Joe, "be it so or be it sont, you must be a common
scholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope! The king upon
his throne, with his crown upon his ed, cant sit and write his acts
of Parliament in print, without having begun, when he were a unpromoted
Prince, with the alphabet.Ah!" added Joe, with a shake of the head
that was full of meaning, "and begun at A. too, and worked his way to Z.
And I know what that is to do, though I cant say Ive exactly done it."
 
There was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged
me.
 
"Whether common ones as to callings and earnings," pursued Joe,
reflectively, "mightnt be the better of continuing for to keep
company with common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon
ones,which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?"
 
"No, Joe."
 
"Im sorry there werent a flag, Pip. Whether that might be or
mightnt be, is a thing as cant be looked into now, without putting
your sister on the Rampage and thats a thing not to be thought of as
being done intentional. Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by a
true friend. Which this to you the true friend say. If you cant get to
be oncommon through going straight, youll never get to do it through
going crooked. So dont tell no more on em, Pip, and live well and die
happy."
 
"You are not angry with me, Joe?"
 
"No, old chap. But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay
of a stunning and outdacious sort,alluding to them which bordered on
wealcutlets and dogfighting,a sincere wellwisher would adwise, Pip,
their being dropped into your meditations, when you go up stairs to bed.
Thats all, old chap, and dont never do it no more."
 
When I got up to my little room and said my prayers, I did not forget
Joes recommendation, and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and
unthankful state, that I thought long after I laid me down, how common
Estella would consider Joe, a mere blacksmith how thick his boots, and
how coarse his hands. I thought how Joe and my sister were then sitting
in the kitchen, and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen, and how
Miss Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen, but were far above the
level of such common doings. I fell asleep recalling what I "used to
do" when I was at Miss Havishams as though I had been there weeks or
months, instead of hours and as though it were quite an old subject of
remembrance, instead of one that had arisen only that day.
 
That was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me. But it
is the same with any life. Imagine one selected day struck out of it,
and think how different its course would have been. Pause you who read
this, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold,
of thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the
formation of the first link on one memorable day.
 
 
 
 
Chapter X
 
The felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke,
that the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to
get out of Biddy everything she knew. In pursuance of this luminous
conception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsles greataunts
at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life,
and that I should feel very much obliged to her if she would impart
all her learning to me. Biddy, who was the most obliging of girls,
immediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out her promise
within five minutes.
 
The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsles greataunt
may be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples
and put straws down one anothers backs, until Mr. Wopsles greataunt
collected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with
a birchrod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision, the
pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to
hand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and
a little spelling,that is to say, it had had once. As soon as this
volume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsles greataunt fell into a state of
coma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils then
entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject
of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon
whose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a rush at
them and distributed three defaced Bibles shaped as if they had been
unskilfully cut off the chump end of something, more illegibly printed
at the best than any curiosities of literature I have since met with,
speckled all over with ironmould, and having various specimens of the
insect world smashed between their leaves. This part of the Course was
usually lightened by several single combats between Biddy and refractory
students. When the fights were over, Biddy gave out the number of a
page, and then we all read aloud what we could,or what we couldntin
a frightful chorus Biddy leading with a high, shrill, monotonous voice,
and none of us having the least notion of, or reverence for, what we
were reading about. When this horrible din had lasted a certain time,
it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsles greataunt, who staggered at a boy
fortuitously, and pulled his ears. This was understood to terminate
the Course for the evening, and we emerged into the air with shrieks of
intellectual victory. It is fair to remark that there was no prohibition
against any pupils entertaining himself with a slate or even with the
ink when there was any, but that it was not easy to pursue that branch
of study in the winter season, on account of the little general shop
in which the classes were holdenand which was also Mr. Wopsles
greataunts sittingroom and bedchamberbeing but faintly illuminated
through the agency of one lowspirited dipcandle and no snuffers.
 
It appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, under
these circumstances nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that
very evening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some
information from her little catalogue of Prices, under the head of moist
sugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English D which she
had imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and which I supposed,
until she told me what it was, to be a design for a buckle.
 
Of course there was a publichouse in the village, and of course Joe
liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there. I had received strict orders
from my sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen, that
evening, on my way from school, and bring him home at my peril. To the
Three Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.
 
There was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalk
scores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to
be never paid off. They had been there ever since I could remember, and
had grown more than I had. But there was a quantity of chalk about our
country, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it
to account.
 
It being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly
at these records but as my business was with Joe and not with him, I
merely wished him good evening, and passed into the common room at the
end of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire,
and where Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a
stranger. Joe greeted me as usual with "Halloa, Pip, old chap!" and the
moment he said that, the stranger turned his head and looked at me.
 
He was a secretlooking man whom I had never seen before. His head was
all on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he were
taking aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in his
mouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away
and looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then he
nodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I might sit
down there.
 
But as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of
resort, I said "No, thank you, sir," and fell into the space Joe made
for me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe,
and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again
when I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his legin a very odd way, as
it struck me.
 
"You was saying," said the strange man, turning to Joe, "that you was a
blacksmith."
 
"Yes. I said it, you know," said Joe.
 
"Whatll you drink, Mr.? You didnt mention your name, by the bye."
 
Joe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it. "Whatll you
drink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?"
 
"Well," said Joe, "to tell you the truth, I aint much in the habit of
drinking at anybodys expense but my own."
 
"Habit? No," returned the stranger, "but once and away, and on a
Saturday night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery."
 
"I wouldnt wish to be stiff company," said Joe. "Rum."
 
"Rum," repeated the stranger. "And will the other gentleman originate a
sentiment."
 
"Rum," said Mr. Wopsle.
 
"Three Rums!" cried the stranger, calling to the landlord. "Glasses
round!"
 
"This other gentleman," observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle,
"is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out. Our clerk at
church."
 
"Aha!" said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. "The
lonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!"
 
"Thats it," said Joe.
 
The stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put
his legs up on the settle that he had to himself. He wore a flapping
broadbrimmed travellers hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over his
head in the manner of a cap so that he showed no hair. As he looked
at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a
halflaugh, come into his face.
 
"I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a
solitary country towards the river."
 
"Most marshes is solitary," said Joe.
 
"No doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or
vagrants of any sort, out there?"
 
"No," said Joe "none but a runaway convict now and then. And we dont
find them, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?"
 
Mr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented
but not warmly.
 
"Seems you have been out after such?" asked the stranger.
 
"Once," returned Joe. "Not that we wanted to take them, you understand
we went out as lookers on me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip. Didnt us, Pip?"
 
"Yes, Joe."
 
The stranger looked at me again,still cocking his eye, as if he were
expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun,and said, "Hes a
likely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?"
 
"Pip," said Joe.
 
"Christened Pip?"
 
"No, not christened Pip."
 
"Surname Pip?"
 
"No," said Joe, "its a kind of family name what he gave himself when a
infant, and is called by."
 
"Son of yours?"
 
"Well," said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in
anywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at
the Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was
discussed over pipes,"wellno. No, he aint."
 
"Nevvy?" said the strange man.
 
"Well," said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, "he
is notno, not to deceive you, he is notmy nevvy."
 
"What the Blue Blazes is he?" asked the stranger. Which appeared to me
to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.
 
Mr. Wopsle struck in upon that as one who knew all about relationships,
having professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man
might not marry and expounded the ties between me and Joe. Having
his hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling
passage from Richard the Third, and seemed to think he had done quite
enough to account for it when he added, "as the poet says."
 
And here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he considered
it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into
my eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of his standing who visited
at our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory
process under similar circumstances. Yet I do not call to mind that I
was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family
circle, but some largehanded person took some such ophthalmic steps to
patronize me.
 
All this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at
me as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me
down. But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation,
until the glasses of rum and water were brought and then he made his
shot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.
 
It was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumbshow, and was
pointedly addressed to me. He stirred his rum and water pointedly at me,
and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me. And he stirred it and
he tasted it not with a spoon that was brought to him, but with a file.
 
He did this so that nobody but I saw the file and when he had done it
he wiped the file and put it in a breastpocket. I knew it to be
Joes file, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the
instrument. I sat gazing at him, spellbound. But he now reclined on his
settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally about
turnips.
 
There was a delicious sense of cleaningup and making a quiet pause
before going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights, which
stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on Saturdays
than at other times. The halfhour and the rum and water running out
together, Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand.
 
"Stop half a moment, Mr. Gargery," said the strange man. "I think Ive
got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, the boy
shall have it."
 
He looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in some
crumpled paper, and gave it to me. "Yours!" said he. "Mind! Your own."
 
I thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners,
and holding tight to Joe. He gave Joe goodnight, and he gave Mr. Wopsle
goodnight who went out with us, and he gave me only a look with his
aiming eye,no, not a look, for he shut it up, but wonders may be done
with an eye by hiding it.
 
On the way home, if I had been in a humor for talking, the talk must
have been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of
the Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wide
open, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible. But I was in
a manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old
acquaintance, and could think of nothing else.
 
My sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in
the kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell
her about the bright shilling. "A bad un, Ill be bound," said Mrs. Joe
triumphantly, "or he wouldnt have given it to the boy! Lets look at
it."
 
I took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one. "But whats
this?" said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up the
paper. "Two OnePound notes?"
 
Nothing less than two fat sweltering onepound notes that seemed to have
been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattlemarkets in
the county. Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with them to the Jolly
Bargemen to restore them to their owner. While he was gone, I sat down
on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling pretty sure
that the man would not be there.
 
Presently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he,
Joe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.
Then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put them under
some dried roseleaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in
the state parlor. There they remained, a nightmare to me, many and many
a night and day.
 
I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the
strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun, and of the guiltily
coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of conspiracy with
convicts,a feature in my low career that I had previously forgotten.
I was haunted by the file too. A dread possessed me that when I least
expected it, the file would reappear. I coaxed myself to sleep by
thinking of Miss Havishams, next Wednesday and in my sleep I saw
the file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who held it, and I
screamed myself awake.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XI
 
At the appointed time I returned to Miss Havishams, and my hesitating
ring at the gate brought out Estella. She locked it after admitting
me, as she had done before, and again preceded me into the dark passage
where her candle stood. She took no notice of me until she had the
candle in her hand, when she looked over her shoulder, superciliously
saying, "You are to come this way today," and took me to quite another
part of the house.
 
The passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole square
basement of the Manor House. We traversed but one side of the square,
however, and at the end of it she stopped, and put her candle down and
opened a door. Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in
a small paved courtyard, the opposite side of which was formed by a
detached dwellinghouse, that looked as if it had once belonged to the
manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery. There was a clock in the
outer wall of this house. Like the clock in Miss Havishams room, and
like Miss Havishams watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.
 
We went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a
low ceiling, on the groundfloor at the back. There was some company in
the room, and Estella said to me as she joined it, "You are to go and
stand there boy, till you are wanted." "There", being the window, I
crossed to it, and stood "there," in a very uncomfortable state of mind,
looking out.
 
It opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of the
neglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbagestalks, and one boxtree
that had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a new
growth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different color, as if
that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt. This
was my homely thought, as I contemplated the boxtree. There had been
some light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge
but, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden,
and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window,
as if it pelted me for coming there.
 
I divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and that
its other occupants were looking at me. I could see nothing of the room
except the shining of the fire in the windowglass, but I stiffened in
all my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.
 
There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Before I had been
standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me that
they were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended not
to know that the others were toadies and humbugs because the admission
that he or she did know it, would have made him or her out to be a toady
and humbug.
 
They all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebodys pleasure,
and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to
repress a yawn. This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded
me of my sister, with the difference that she was older, and as I found
when I caught sight of her of a blunter cast of features. Indeed, when
I knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she had any features
at all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of her face.
 
"Poor dear soul!" said this lady, with an abruptness of manner quite my
sisters. "Nobodys enemy but his own!"
 
"It would be much more commendable to be somebody elses enemy," said
the gentleman "far more natural."
 
"Cousin Raymond," observed another lady, "we are to love our neighbor."
 
"Sarah Pocket," returned Cousin Raymond, "if a man is not his own
neighbor, who is?"
 
Miss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said checking a yawn,
"The idea!" But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good
idea too. The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and
emphatically, "Very true!"
 
"Poor soul!" Camilla presently went on I knew they had all been looking
at me in the mean time, "he is so very strange! Would anyone believe
that when Toms wife died, he actually could not be induced to see the
importance of the childrens having the deepest of trimmings to their
mourning? Good Lord! says he, Camilla, what can it signify so long
as the poor bereaved little things are in black? So like Matthew! The
idea!"
 
"Good points in him, good points in him," said Cousin Raymond "Heaven
forbid I should deny good points in him but he never had, and he never
will have, any sense of the proprieties."
 
"You know I was obliged," said Camilla,"I was obliged to be firm. I
said, It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family. I told him that,
without deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it from
breakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last he flung out
in his violent way, and said, with a D, Then do as you like. Thank
Goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly
went out in a pouring rain and bought the things."
 
"He paid for them, did he not?" asked Estella.
 
"Its not the question, my dear child, who paid for them," returned
Camilla. "I bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace,
when I wake up in the night."
 
The ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or
call along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the conversation
and caused Estella to say to me, "Now, boy!" On my turning round, they
all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went out, I heard
Sarah Pocket say, "Well I am sure! What next!" and Camilla add, with
indignation, "Was there ever such a fancy! The idea!"
 
As we were going with our candle along the dark passage, Estella stopped
all of a sudden, and, facing round, said in her taunting manner, with
her face quite close to mine,
 
"Well?"
 
"Well, miss?" I answered, almost falling over her and checking myself.
 
She stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at her.
 
"Am I pretty?"
 
"Yes I think you are very pretty."
 
"Am I insulting?"
 
"Not so much so as you were last time," said I.
 
"Not so much so?"
 
"No."
 
She fired when she asked the last question, and she slapped my face with
such force as she had, when I answered it.
 
"Now?" said she. "You little coarse monster, what do you think of me
now?"
 
"I shall not tell you."
 
"Because you are going to tell up stairs. Is that it?"
 
"No," said I, "thats not it."
 
"Why dont you cry again, you little wretch?"
 
"Because Ill never cry for you again," said I. Which was, I suppose, as
false a declaration as ever was made for I was inwardly crying for her
then, and I know what I know of the pain she cost me afterwards.
 
We went on our way up stairs after this episode and, as we were going
up, we met a gentleman groping his way down.
 
"Whom have we here?" asked the gentleman, stopping and looking at me.
 
"A boy," said Estella.
 
He was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion, with an
exceedingly large head, and a corresponding large hand. He took my chin
in his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the
light of the candle. He was prematurely bald on the top of his head, and
had bushy black eyebrows that wouldnt lie down but stood up bristling.
His eyes were set very deep in his head, and were disagreeably sharp and
suspicious. He had a large watchchain, and strong black dots where his
beard and whiskers would have been if he had let them. He was nothing
to me, and I could have had no foresight then, that he ever would be
anything to me, but it happened that I had this opportunity of observing
him well.
 
"Boy of the neighborhood? Hey?" said he.
 
"Yes, sir," said I.
 
"How do you come here?"
 
"Miss Havisham sent for me, sir," I explained.
 
"Well! Behave yourself. I have a pretty large experience of boys, and
youre a bad set of fellows. Now mind!" said he, biting the side of his
great forefinger as he frowned at me, "you behave yourself!"
 
With those words, he released mewhich I was glad of, for his hand
smelt of scented soapand went his way down stairs. I wondered whether
he could be a doctor but no, I thought he couldnt be a doctor, or he
would have a quieter and more persuasive manner. There was not much time
to consider the subject, for we were soon in Miss Havishams room, where
she and everything else were just as I had left them. Estella left me
standing near the door, and I stood there until Miss Havisham cast her
eyes upon me from the dressingtable.
 
"So!" she said, without being startled or surprised "the days have worn
away, have they?"
 
"Yes, maam. Today is"
 
"There, there, there!" with the impatient movement of her fingers. "I
dont want to know. Are you ready to play?"
 
I was obliged to answer in some confusion, "I dont think I am, maam."
 
"Not at cards again?" she demanded, with a searching look.
 
"Yes, maam I could do that, if I was wanted."
 
"Since this house strikes you old and grave, boy," said Miss Havisham,
impatiently, "and you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?"
 
I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to
find for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.
 
"Then go into that opposite room," said she, pointing at the door behind
me with her withered hand, "and wait there till I come."
 
I crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated.
From that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had an
airless smell that was oppressive. A fire had been lately kindled in
the damp oldfashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than
to burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder
than the clearer air,like our own marsh mist. Certain wintry branches
of candles on the high chimneypiece faintly lighted the chamber or it
would be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its darkness. It was
spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but every discernible
thing in it was covered with dust and mould, and dropping to pieces. The
most prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it,
as if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all
stopped together. An epergne or centrepiece of some kind was in the
middle of this cloth it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its
form was quite undistinguishable and, as I looked along the yellow
expanse out of which I remember its seeming to grow, like a black
fungus, I saw specklelegged spiders with blotchy bodies running home
to it, and running out from it, as if some circumstances of the greatest
public importance had just transpired in the spider community.
 
I heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same
occurrence were important to their interests. But the black beetles took
no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a ponderous
elderly way, as if they were shortsighted and hard of hearing, and not
on terms with one another.
 
These crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching
them from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.
In her other hand she had a crutchheaded stick on which she leaned, and
she looked like the Witch of the place.
 
"This," said she, pointing to the long table with her stick, "is where I
will be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here."
 
With some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and
there and die at once, the complete realization of the ghastly waxwork
at the Fair, I shrank under her touch.
 
"What do you think that is?" she asked me, again pointing with her
stick "that, where those cobwebs are?"
 
"I cant guess what it is, maam."
 
"Its a great cake. A bridecake. Mine!"
 
She looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said,
leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, "Come, come, come!
Walk me, walk me!"
 
I made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss
Havisham round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, and
she leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have
been an imitation founded on my first impulse under that roof of Mr.
Pumblechooks chaisecart.
 
She was not physically strong, and after a little time said, "Slower!"
Still, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she
twitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and led me to
believe that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast. After a
while she said, "Call Estella!" so I went out on the landing and
roared that name as I had done on the previous occasion. When her light
appeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round
and round the room.
 
If only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should
have felt sufficiently discontented but as she brought with her the
three ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didnt know
what to do. In my politeness, I would have stopped but Miss
Havisham twitched my shoulder, and we posted on,with a shamefaced
consciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing.
 
"Dear Miss Havisham," said Miss Sarah Pocket. "How well you look!"
 
"I do not," returned Miss Havisham. "I am yellow skin and bone."
 
Camilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff and she
murmured, as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, "Poor dear
soul! Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing. The idea!"
 
"And how are you?" said Miss Havisham to Camilla. As we were close to
Camilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Miss
Havisham wouldnt stop. We swept on, and I felt that I was highly
obnoxious to Camilla.
 
"Thank you, Miss Havisham," she returned, "I am as well as can be
expected."
 
"Why, whats the matter with you?" asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding
sharpness.
 
"Nothing worth mentioning," replied Camilla. "I dont wish to make a
display of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in the
night than I am quite equal to."
 
"Then dont think of me," retorted Miss Havisham.
 
"Very easily said!" remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while a
hitch came into her upper lip, and her tears overflowed. "Raymond is a
witness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night.
Raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs. Chokings
and nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think with
anxiety of those I love. If I could be less affectionate and sensitive,
I should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves. I am sure
I wish it could be so. But as to not thinking of you in the nightThe
idea!" Here, a burst of tears.
 
The Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and
him I understood to be Mr. Camilla. He came to the rescue at this point,
and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, "Camilla, my dear, it
is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to
the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other."
 
"I am not aware," observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but
once, "that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that
person, my dear."
 
Miss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugated
old woman, with a small face that might have been made of walnutshells,
and a large mouth like a cats without the whiskers, supported this
position by saying, "No, indeed, my dear. Hem!"
 
"Thinking is easy enough," said the grave lady.
 
"What is easier, you know?" assented Miss Sarah Pocket.
 
"Oh, yes, yes!" cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared to
rise from her legs to her bosom. "Its all very true! Its a weakness
to be so affectionate, but I cant help it. No doubt my health would be
much better if it was otherwise, still I wouldnt change my disposition
if I could. Its the cause of much suffering, but its a consolation to
know I posses it, when I wake up in the night." Here another burst of
feeling.
 
Miss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going
round and round the room now brushing against the skirts of the
visitors, now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber.
 
"Theres Matthew!" said Camilla. "Never mixing with any natural ties,
never coming here to see how Miss Havisham is! I have taken to the sofa
with my staylace cut, and have lain there hours insensible, with my head
over the side, and my hair all down, and my feet I dont know where"
 
"Much higher than your head, my love," said Mr. Camilla.
 
"I have gone off into that state, hours and hours, on account of
Matthews strange and inexplicable conduct, and nobody has thanked me."
 
"Really I must say I should think not!" interposed the grave lady.
 
"You see, my dear," added Miss Sarah Pocket a blandly vicious
personage, "the question to put to yourself is, who did you expect to
thank you, my love?"
 
"Without expecting any thanks, or anything of the sort," resumed
Camilla, "I have remained in that state, hours and hours, and Raymond
is a witness of the extent to which I have choked, and what the total
inefficacy of ginger has been, and I have been heard at the pianoforte
tuners across the street, where the poor mistaken children have even
supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance,and now to be told"
Here Camilla put her hand to her throat, and began to be quite chemical
as to the formation of new combinations there.
 
When this same Matthew was mentioned, Miss Havisham stopped me and
herself, and stood looking at the speaker. This change had a great
influence in bringing Camillas chemistry to a sudden end.
 
"Matthew will come and see me at last," said Miss Havisham, sternly,
"when I am laid on that table. That will be his place,there," striking
the table with her stick, "at my head! And yours will be there! And your
husbands there! And Sarah Pockets there! And Georgianas there! Now
you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me.
And now go!"
 
At the mention of each name, she had struck the table with her stick in
a new place. She now said, "Walk me, walk me!" and we went on again.
 
"I suppose theres nothing to be done," exclaimed Camilla, "but comply
and depart. Its something to have seen the object of ones love and
duty for even so short a time. I shall think of it with a melancholy
satisfaction when I wake up in the night. I wish Matthew could have
that comfort, but he sets it at defiance. I am determined not to make a
display of my feelings, but its very hard to be told one wants to feast
on ones relations,as if one was a Giant,and to be told to go. The
bare idea!"
 
Mr. Camilla interposing, as Mrs. Camilla laid her hand upon her heaving
bosom, that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I
supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of
view, and kissing her hand to Miss Havisham, was escorted forth. Sarah
Pocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last but Sarah was
too knowing to be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana with that artful
slipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence. Sarah
Pocket then made her separate effect of departing with, "Bless you, Miss
Havisham dear!" and with a smile of forgiving pity on her walnutshell
countenance for the weaknesses of the rest.
 
While Estella was away lighting them down, Miss Havisham still walked
with her hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly. At last she
stopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at it
some seconds,
 
"This is my birthday, Pip."
 
I was going to wish her many happy returns, when she lifted her stick.
 
"I dont suffer it to be spoken of. I dont suffer those who were here
just now, or any one to speak of it. They come here on the day, but they
dare not refer to it."
 
Of course I made no further effort to refer to it.
 
"On this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap of
decay," stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the
table, but not touching it, "was brought here. It and I have worn away
together. The mice have gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth of
mice have gnawed at me."
 
She held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking
at the table she in her once white dress, all yellow and withered the
once white cloth all yellow and withered everything around in a state
to crumble under a touch.
 
"When the ruin is complete," said she, with a ghastly look, "and when
they lay me dead, in my brides dress on the brides table,which shall
be done, and which will be the finished curse upon him,so much the
better if it is done on this day!"
 
She stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own figure
lying there. I remained quiet. Estella returned, and she too remained
quiet. It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time. In
the heavy air of the room, and the heavy darkness that brooded in its
remoter corners, I even had an alarming fancy that Estella and I might
presently begin to decay.
 
At length, not coming out of her distraught state by degrees, but in an
instant, Miss Havisham said, "Let me see you two play cards why have
you not begun?" With that, we returned to her room, and sat down as
before I was beggared, as before and again, as before, Miss Havisham
watched us all the time, directed my attention to Estellas beauty, and
made me notice it the more by trying her jewels on Estellas breast and
hair.
 
Estella, for her part, likewise treated me as before, except that she
did not condescend to speak. When we had played some halfdozen games,
a day was appointed for my return, and I was taken down into the yard
to be fed in the former doglike manner. There, too, I was again left to
wander about as I liked.
 
It is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which
I had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that last
occasion, open or shut. Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I
saw one now. As it stood open, and as I knew that Estella had let
the visitors out,for she had returned with the keys in her hand,I
strolled into the garden, and strolled all over it. It was quite a
wilderness, and there were old melonframes and cucumberframes in it,
which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of
weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with now and then a weedy
offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan.
 
When I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but
a fallendown grapevine and some bottles, I found myself in the dismal
corner upon which I had looked out of the window. Never questioning for
a moment that the house was now empty, I looked in at another window,
and found myself, to my great surprise, exchanging a broad stare with a
pale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair.
 
This pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared beside me.
He had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him, and I
now saw that he was inky.
 
"Halloa!" said he, "young fellow!"
 
Halloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to
be best answered by itself, I said, "Halloa!" politely omitting young
fellow.
 
"Who let you in?" said he.
 
"Miss Estella."
 
"Who gave you leave to prowl about?"
 
"Miss Estella."
 
"Come and fight," said the pale young gentleman.
 
What could I do but follow him? I have often asked myself the question
since but what else could I do? His manner was so final, and I was
so astonished, that I followed where he led, as if I had been under a
spell.
 
"Stop a minute, though," he said, wheeling round before we had gone many
paces. "I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too. There it is!"
In a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against one
another, daintily flung one of his legs up behind him, pulled my hair,
slapped his hands again, dipped his head, and butted it into my stomach.
 
The bulllike proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was
unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, was
particularly disagreeable just after bread and meat. I therefore hit out
at him and was going to hit out again, when he said, "Aha! Would you?"
and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled
within my limited experience.
 
"Laws of the game!" said he. Here, he skipped from his left leg on to
his right. "Regular rules!" Here, he skipped from his right leg on to
his left. "Come to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!" Here,
he dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while I
looked helplessly at him.
 
I was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous but I felt
morally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have
had no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to
consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention. Therefore, I
followed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by
the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish. On his asking me
if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, he begged my
leave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned with a bottle
of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. "Available for both," he said,
placing these against the wall. And then fell to pulling off, not
only his jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in a manner at once
lighthearted, businesslike, and bloodthirsty.
 
Although he did not look very healthy,having pimples on his face, and
a breaking out at his mouth,these dreadful preparations quite appalled
me. I judged him to be about my own age, but he was much taller, and he
had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance. For
the rest, he was a young gentleman in a gray suit when not denuded
for battle, with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in
advance of the rest of him as to development.
 
My heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with every
demonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he were
minutely choosing his bone. I never have been so surprised in my life,
as I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his
back, looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly
foreshortened.
 
But, he was on his feet directly, and after sponging himself with
a great show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest
surprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again,
looking up at me out of a black eye.
 
His spirit inspired me with great respect. He seemed to have no
strength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked down
but he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or drinking out
of the waterbottle, with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself
according to form, and then came at me with an air and a show that made
me believe he really was going to do for me at last. He got heavily
bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I hit him, the harder I
hit him but he came up again and again and again, until at last he got
a bad fall with the back of his head against the wall. Even after that
crisis in our affairs, he got up and turned round and round confusedly a
few times, not knowing where I was but finally went on his knees to his
sponge and threw it up at the same time panting out, "That means you
have won."
 
He seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the
contest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I go
so far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of
savage young wolf or other wild beast. However, I got dressed, darkly
wiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, "Can I help you?"
and he said "No thankee," and I said "Good afternoon," and he said "Same
to you."
 
When I got into the courtyard, I found Estella waiting with the keys.
But she neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept her
waiting and there was a bright flush upon her face, as though something
had happened to delight her. Instead of going straight to the gate, too,
she stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me.
 
"Come here! You may kiss me, if you like."
 
I kissed her cheek as she turned it to me. I think I would have gone
through a great deal to kiss her cheek. But I felt that the kiss was
given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been, and
that it was worth nothing.
 
What with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what with
the fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home the light
on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against
a black nightsky, and Joes furnace was flinging a path of fire across
the road.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XII
 
My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman. The
more I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentleman on
his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, the
more certain it appeared that something would be done to me. I felt that
the pale young gentlemans blood was on my head, and that the Law would
avenge it. Without having any definite idea of the penalties I had
incurred, it was clear to me that village boys could not go stalking
about the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into
the studious youth of England, without laying themselves open to severe
punishment. For some days, I even kept close at home, and looked out at
the kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going
on an errand, lest the officers of the County Jail should pounce upon
me. The pale young gentlemans nose had stained my trousers, and I tried
to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night. I had cut
my knuckles against the pale young gentlemans teeth, and I twisted my
imagination into a thousand tangles, as I devised incredible ways of
accounting for that damnatory circumstance when I should be haled before
the Judges.
 
When the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of
violence, my terrors reached their height. Whether myrmidons of Justice,
specially sent down from London, would be lying in ambush behind the
gatewhether Miss Havisham, preferring to take personal vengeance for
an outrage done to her house, might rise in those graveclothes of hers,
draw a pistol, and shoot me deadwhether suborned boysa numerous
band of mercenariesmight be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery,
and cuff me until I was no moreit was high testimony to my confidence
in the spirit of the pale young gentleman, that I never imagined him
accessory to these retaliations they always came into my mind as the
acts of injudicious relatives of his, goaded on by the state of his
visage and an indignant sympathy with the family features.
 
However, go to Miss Havishams I must, and go I did. And behold! nothing
came of the late struggle. It was not alluded to in any way, and no pale
young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises. I found the same
gate open, and I explored the garden, and even looked in at the windows
of the detached house but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed
shutters within, and all was lifeless. Only in the corner where
the combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of the young
gentlemans existence. There were traces of his gore in that spot, and I
covered them with gardenmould from the eye of man.
 
On the broad landing between Miss Havishams own room and that other
room in which the long table was laid out, I saw a gardenchair,a
light chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind. It had been placed
there since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regular
occupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair when she was tired of
walking with her hand upon my shoulder round her own room, and across
the landing, and round the other room. Over and over and over again,
we would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as long as
three hours at a stretch. I insensibly fall into a general mention of
these journeys as numerous, because it was at once settled that I should
return every alternate day at noon for these purposes, and because I am
now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months.
 
As we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more
to me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was
I going to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I
believed and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know
everything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards that
desirable end. But she did not on the contrary, she seemed to prefer my
being ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money,or anything
but my daily dinner,nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my
services.
 
Estella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told
me I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me
sometimes, she would condescend to me sometimes, she would be quite
familiar with me sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she
hated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we were
alone, "Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?" And when I said yes
for indeed she did, would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when we
played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish of
Estellas moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods were
so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what
to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness,
murmuring something in her ear that sounded like "Break their hearts my
pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!"
 
There was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which the
burden was Old Clem. This was not a very ceremonious way of rendering
homage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in that relation
towards smiths. It was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon
iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of Old Clems
respected name. Thus, you were to hammer boys roundOld Clem! With a
thump and a soundOld Clem! Beat it out, beat it outOld Clem! With a
clink for the stoutOld Clem! Blow the fire, blow the fireOld
Clem! Roaring dryer, soaring higherOld Clem! One day soon after the
appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly saying to me, with the
impatient movement of her fingers, "There, there, there! Sing!" I was
surprised into crooning this ditty as I pushed her over the floor. It
happened so to catch her fancy that she took it up in a low brooding
voice as if she were singing in her sleep. After that, it became
customary with us to have it as we moved about, and Estella would often
join in though the whole strain was so subdued, even when there were
three of us, that it made less noise in the grim old house than the
lightest breath of wind.
 
What could I become with these surroundings? How could my character fail
to be influenced by them? Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were
dazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural light from the
misty yellow rooms?
 
Perhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I had
not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which
I had confessed. Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly
fail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger
to be put into the black velvet coach therefore, I said nothing of him.
Besides, that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella discussed,
which had come upon me in the beginning, grew much more potent as time
went on. I reposed complete confidence in no one but Biddy but I told
poor Biddy everything. Why it came natural to me to do so, and why Biddy
had a deep concern in everything I told her, I did not know then, though
I think I know now.
 
Meanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with
almost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit. That ass,
Pumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of
discussing my prospects with my sister and I really do believe to
this hour with less penitence than I ought to feel, that if these hands
could have taken a linchpin out of his chaisecart, they would have done
it. The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of mind, that
he could not discuss my prospects without having me before him,as it
were, to operate upon,and he would drag me up from my stool usually
by the collar where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me before the
fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying, "Now, Mum,
here is this boy! Here is this boy which you brought up by hand. Hold up
your head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them which so did do. Now,
Mum, with respections to this boy!" And then he would rumple my hair
the wrong way,which from my earliest remembrance, as already hinted,
I have in my soul denied the right of any fellowcreature to do,and
would hold me before him by the sleeve,a spectacle of imbecility only
to be equalled by himself.
 
Then, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations
about Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me and for me,
that I used to wantquite painfullyto burst into spiteful tears, fly
at Pumblechook, and pummel him all over. In these dialogues, my sister
spoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at
every reference while Pumblechook himself, selfconstituted my patron,
would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of
my fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.
 
In these discussions, Joe bore no part. But he was often talked at,
while they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joes perceiving that
he was not favorable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully old
enough now to be apprenticed to Joe and when Joe sat with the poker on
his knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my
sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition
on his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker out of his
hands, shake him, and put it away. There was a most irritating end to
every one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing to lead up to
it, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catching sight of me as
it were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, "Come! theres enough of
you! You get along to bed youve given trouble enough for one night, I
hope!" As if I had besought them as a favor to bother my life out.
 
We went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that we
should continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Miss
Havisham stopped short as she and I were walking, she leaning on my
shoulder and said with some displeasure,
 
"You are growing tall, Pip!"
 
I thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look, that
this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no control.
 
She said no more at the time but she presently stopped and looked at me
again and presently again and after that, looked frowning and moody.
On the next day of my attendance, when our usual exercise was over, and
I had landed her at her dressingtable, she stayed me with a movement of
her impatient fingers
 
"Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours."
 
"Joe Gargery, maam."
 
"Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?"
 
"Yes, Miss Havisham."
 
"You had better be apprenticed at once. Would Gargery come here with
you, and bring your indentures, do you think?"
 
I signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honor to be
asked.
 
"Then let him come."
 
"At any particular time, Miss Havisham?"
 
"There, there! I know nothing about times. Let him come soon, and come
along with you."
 
When I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister
"went on the Rampage," in a more alarming degree than at any previous
period. She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was doormats under
our feet, and how we dared to use her so, and what company we graciously
thought she was fit for? When she had exhausted a torrent of such
inquiries, she threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loud sobbing,
got out the dustpan,which was always a very bad sign,put on her
coarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent. Not satisfied
with a dry cleaning, she took to a pail and scrubbingbrush, and cleaned
us out of house and home, so that we stood shivering in the backyard.
It was ten oclock at night before we ventured to creep in again, and
then she asked Joe why he hadnt married a Negress Slave at once?
Joe offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling his whisker and
looking dejectedly at me, as if he thought it really might have been a
better speculation.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XIII
 
It was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see
Joe arraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss
Havishams. However, as he thought his courtsuit necessary to the
occasion, it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in his
workingdress the rather, because I knew he made himself so dreadfully
uncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it was for me he pulled
up his shirtcollar so very high behind, that it made the hair on the
crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers.
 
At breakfasttime my sister declared her intention of going to town with
us, and being left at Uncle Pumblechooks and called for "when we had
done with our fine ladies"a way of putting the case, from which Joe
appeared inclined to augur the worst. The forge was shut up for the day,
and Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door as it was his custom to do on
the very rare occasions when he was not at work the monosyllable
HOUT, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the
direction he had taken.
 
We walked to town, my sister leading the way in a very large beaver
bonnet, and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaited
Straw, a pair of pattens, a spare shawl, and an umbrella, though it
was a fine bright day. I am not quite clear whether these articles were
carried penitentially or ostentatiously but I rather think they were
displayed as articles of property,much as Cleopatra or any other
sovereign lady on the Rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or
procession.
 
When we came to Pumblechooks, my sister bounced in and left us. As it
was almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havishams house.
Estella opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she appeared, Joe took
his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands as if
he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a
quarter of an ounce.
 
Estella took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I knew
so well. I followed next to her, and Joe came last. When I looked back
at Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat with the
greatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of
his toes.
 
Estella told me we were both to go in, so I took Joe by the coatcuff
and conducted him into Miss Havishams presence. She was seated at her
dressingtable, and looked round at us immediately.
 
"Oh!" said she to Joe. "You are the husband of the sister of this boy?"
 
I could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or
so like some extraordinary bird standing as he did speechless, with his
tuft of feathers ruffled, and his mouth open as if he wanted a worm.
 
"You are the husband," repeated Miss Havisham, "of the sister of this
boy?"
 
It was very aggravating but, throughout the interview, Joe persisted in
addressing Me instead of Miss Havisham.
 
"Which I meantersay, Pip," Joe now observed in a manner that was at
once expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and great
politeness, "as I hup and married your sister, and I were at the time
what you might call if you was anyways inclined a single man."
 
"Well!" said Miss Havisham. "And you have reared the boy, with the
intention of taking him for your apprentice is that so, Mr. Gargery?"
 
"You know, Pip," replied Joe, "as you and me were ever friends, and it
were looked forard to betwixt us, as being calclated to lead to
larks. Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to the
business,such as its being open to black and sut, or suchlike,not
but what they would have been attended to, dont you see?"
 
"Has the boy," said Miss Havisham, "ever made any objection? Does he
like the trade?"
 
"Which it is well beknown to yourself, Pip," returned Joe, strengthening
his former mixture of argumentation, confidence, and politeness, "that
it were the wish of your own hart." I saw the idea suddenly break upon
him that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion, before he went on
to say "And there werent no objection on your part, and Pip it were
the great wish of your hart!"
 
It was quite in vain for me to endeavor to make him sensible that he
ought to speak to Miss Havisham. The more I made faces and gestures
to him to do it, the more confidential, argumentative, and polite, he
persisted in being to Me.
 
"Have you brought his indentures with you?" asked Miss Havisham.
 
"Well, Pip, you know," replied Joe, as if that were a little
unreasonable, "you yourself see me put em in my at, and therefore you
know as they are here." With which he took them out, and gave them, not
to Miss Havisham, but to me. I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good
fellow,I know I was ashamed of him,when I saw that Estella stood
at the back of Miss Havishams chair, and that her eyes laughed
mischievously. I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to
Miss Havisham.
 
"You expected," said Miss Havisham, as she looked them over, "no premium
with the boy?"
 
"Joe!" I remonstrated, for he made no reply at all. "Why dont you
answer"
 
"Pip," returned Joe, cutting me short as if he were hurt, "which I
meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself
and me, and which you know the answer to be full well No. You know it to
be No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?"
 
Miss Havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was
better than I had thought possible, seeing what he was there and took
up a little bag from the table beside her.
 
"Pip has earned a premium here," she said, "and here it is. There are
fiveandtwenty guineas in this bag. Give it to your master, Pip."
 
As if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in
him by her strange figure and the strange room, Joe, even at this pass,
persisted in addressing me.
 
"This is wery liberal on your part, Pip," said Joe, "and it is as such
received and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near,
nor nowheres. And now, old chap," said Joe, conveying to me a sensation,
first of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if that familiar
expression were applied to Miss Havisham,"and now, old chap, may we
do our duty! May you and me do our duty, both on us, by one and another,
and by them which your liberal presenthaveconweyedto befor the
satisfaction of mindofthem as never" here Joe showed that he felt
he had fallen into frightful difficulties, until he triumphantly rescued
himself with the words, "and from myself far be it!" These words had
such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them twice.
 
"Good by, Pip!" said Miss Havisham. "Let them out, Estella."
 
"Am I to come again, Miss Havisham?" I asked.
 
"No. Gargery is your master now. Gargery! One word!"
 
Thus calling him back as I went out of the door, I heard her say to Joe
in a distinct emphatic voice, "The boy has been a good boy here, and
that is his reward. Of course, as an honest man, you will expect no
other and no more."
 
How Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine but
I know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding up stairs
instead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went
after him and laid hold of him. In another minute we were outside the
gate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone. When we stood in the
daylight alone again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me,
"Astonishing!" And there he remained so long saying, "Astonishing" at
intervals, so often, that I began to think his senses were never coming
back. At length he prolonged his remark into "Pip, I do assure you this
is asTONishing!" and so, by degrees, became conversational and able to
walk away.
 
I have reason to think that Joes intellects were brightened by the
encounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechooks
he invented a subtle and deep design. My reason is to be found in
what took place in Mr. Pumblechooks parlor where, on our presenting
ourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.
 
"Well?" cried my sister, addressing us both at once. "And whats
happened to you? I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor
society as this, I am sure I do!"
 
"Miss Havisham," said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort of
remembrance, "made it wery partickler that we should give herwere it
compliments or respects, Pip?"
 
"Compliments," I said.
 
"Which that were my own belief," answered Joe "her compliments to Mrs.
J. Gargery"
 
"Much good theyll do me!" observed my sister but rather gratified too.
 
"And wishing," pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like another
effort of remembrance, "that the state of Miss Havishams elth were
sitch as would haveallowed, were it, Pip?"
 
"Of her having the pleasure," I added.
 
"Of ladies company," said Joe. And drew a long breath.
 
"Well!" cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook.
"She might have had the politeness to send that message at first, but
its better late than never. And what did she give young Rantipole
here?"
 
"She giv him," said Joe, "nothing."
 
Mrs. Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on.
 
"What she giv," said Joe, "she giv to his friends. And by his
friends, were her explanation, I mean into the hands of his sister
Mrs. J. Gargery. Them were her words Mrs. J. Gargery. She maynt
have knowd," added Joe, with an appearance of reflection, "whether it
were Joe, or Jorge."
 
My sister looked at Pumblechook who smoothed the elbows of his wooden
armchair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he had known all
about it beforehand.
 
"And how much have you got?" asked my sister, laughing. Positively
laughing!
 
"What would present company say to ten pound?" demanded Joe.
 
"Theyd say," returned my sister, curtly, "pretty well. Not too much,
but pretty well."
 
"Its more than that, then," said Joe.
 
That fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as he
rubbed the arms of his chair, "Its more than that, Mum."
 
"Why, you dont mean to say" began my sister.
 
"Yes I do, Mum," said Pumblechook "but wait a bit. Go on, Joseph. Good
in you! Go on!"
 
"What would present company say," proceeded Joe, "to twenty pound?"
 
"Handsome would be the word," returned my sister.
 
"Well, then," said Joe, "Its more than twenty pound."
 
That abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a
patronizing laugh, "Its more than that, Mum. Good again! Follow her up,
Joseph!"
 
"Then to make an end of it," said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to my
sister "its fiveandtwenty pound."
 
"Its fiveandtwenty pound, Mum," echoed that basest of swindlers,
Pumblechook, rising to shake hands with her "and its no more than your
merits as I said when my opinion was asked, and I wish you joy of the
money!"
 
If the villain had stopped here, his case would have been sufficiently
awful, but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into custody,
with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality far
behind.
 
"Now you see, Joseph and wife," said Pumblechook, as he took me by the
arm above the elbow, "I am one of them that always go right through with
what theyve begun. This boy must be bound, out of hand. Thats my way.
Bound out of hand."
 
"Goodness knows, Uncle Pumblechook," said my sister grasping the
money, "were deeply beholden to you."
 
"Never mind me, Mum," returned that diabolical cornchandler. "A
pleasures a pleasure all the world over. But this boy, you know we
must have him bound. I said Id see to itto tell you the truth."
 
The Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at
once went over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial
presence. I say we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook,
exactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick indeed,
it was the general impression in Court that I had been taken redhanded
for, as Pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd, I heard some
people say, "Whats he done?" and others, "Hes a young un, too, but
looks bad, dont he?" One person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave
me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted
up with a perfect sausageshop of fetters, and entitled TO BE READ IN MY
CELL.
 
The Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than a
church,and with people hanging over the pews looking on,and with
mighty Justices one with a powdered head leaning back in chairs, with
folded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or reading
the newspapers,and with some shining black portraits on the walls,
which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and
stickingplaster. Here, in a corner my indentures were duly signed and
attested, and I was "bound" Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the while
as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold, to have those little
preliminaries disposed of.
 
When we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had been put
into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured,
and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely
rallying round me, we went back to Pumblechooks. And there my sister
became so excited by the twentyfive guineas, that nothing would serve
her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue Boar, and
that Pumblechook must go over in his chaisecart, and bring the Hubbles
and Mr. Wopsle.
 
It was agreed to be done and a most melancholy day I passed. For,
it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole
company, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment. And to make it
worse, they all asked me from time to time,in short, whenever they
had nothing else to do,why I didnt enjoy myself? And what could I
possibly do then, but say I was enjoying myself,when I wasnt!
 
However, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the
most of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent
contriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table
and, when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had
fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I
played at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company,
or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared
to contemplate as next to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chair
beside him to illustrate his remarks.
 
My only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they wouldnt
let me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off, woke me up
and told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in the evening Mr. Wopsle
gave us Collinss ode, and threw his bloodstained sword in thunder
down, with such effect, that a waiter came in and said, "The Commercials
underneath sent up their compliments, and it wasnt the Tumblers Arms."
That, they were all in excellent spirits on the road home, and sang, O
Lady Fair! Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, and asserting with a tremendously
strong voice in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece
of music in a most impertinent manner, by wanting to know all about
everybodys private affairs that he was the man with his white locks
flowing, and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going.
 
Finally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly
wretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like
Joes trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XIV
 
It is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. There may be black
ingratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributive and well
deserved but that it is a miserable thing, I can testify.
 
Home had never been a very pleasant place to me, because of my sisters
temper. But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had believed in it. I had
believed in the best parlor as a most elegant saloon I had believed
in the front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose
solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls I had
believed in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment
I had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and
independence. Within a single year all this was changed. Now it was all
coarse and common, and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella
see it on any account.
 
How much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault,
how much Miss Havishams, how much my sisters, is now of no moment to
me or to any one. The change was made in me the thing was done. Well or
ill done, excusably or inexcusably, it was done.
 
Once, it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my
shirtsleeves and go into the forge, Joes prentice, I should be
distinguished and happy. Now the reality was in my hold, I only felt
that I was dusty with the dust of smallcoal, and that I had a weight
upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather. There have
been occasions in my later life I suppose as in most lives when I have
felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest
and romance, to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more.
Never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when my way in
life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road
of apprenticeship to Joe.
 
I remember that at a later period of my "time," I used to stand about
the churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling, comparing my
own perspective with the windy marsh view, and making out some likeness
between them by thinking how flat and low both were, and how on both
there came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea. I was quite
as dejected on the first workingday of my apprenticeship as in that
aftertime but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe
while my indentures lasted. It is about the only thing I am glad to know
of myself in that connection.
 
For, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what I
proceed to add was Joes. It was not because I was faithful, but because
Joe was faithful, that I never ran away and went for a soldier or
a sailor. It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of
industry, but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry,
that I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain. It is not possible
to know how far the influence of any amiable honesthearted dutydoing
man flies out into the world but it is very possible to know how it has
touched ones self in going by, and I know right well that any good that
intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented Joe,
and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.
 
What I wanted, who can say? How can I say, when I never knew? What
I dreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my grimiest and
commonest, should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one
of the wooden windows of the forge. I was haunted by the fear that she
would, sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doing
the coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me.
Often after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we were
singing Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss
Havishams would seem to show me Estellas face in the fire, with her
pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me,often at
such a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the wall
which the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw her just
drawing her face away, and would believe that she had come at last.
 
After that, when we went in to supper, the place and the meal would have
a more homely look than ever, and I would feel more ashamed of home than
ever, in my own ungracious breast.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XV
 
As I was getting too big for Mr. Wopsles greataunts room, my
education under that preposterous female terminated. Not, however, until
Biddy had imparted to me everything she knew, from the little catalogue
of prices, to a comic song she had once bought for a halfpenny.
Although the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were
the opening lines.
 
When I went to Lunnon town sirs, Too rul loo rul Too rul loo rul Wasnt
I done very brown sirs? Too rul loo rul Too rul loo rulstill, in
my desire to be wiser, I got this composition by heart with the utmost
gravity nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit, except that I
thought as I still do the amount of Too rul somewhat in excess of the
poetry. In my hunger for information, I made proposals to Mr. Wopsle to
bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me, with which he kindly complied.
As it turned out, however, that he only wanted me for a dramatic
layfigure, to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied
and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways, I soon
declined that course of instruction though not until Mr. Wopsle in his
poetic fury had severely mauled me.
 
Whatever I acquired, I tried to impart to Joe. This statement sounds so
well, that I cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained. I wanted
to make Joe less ignorant and common, that he might be worthier of my
society and less open to Estellas reproach.
 
The old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study, and a broken
slate and a short piece of slatepencil were our educational implements
to which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco. I never knew Joe to
remember anything from one Sunday to another, or to acquire, under my
tuition, any piece of information whatever. Yet he would smoke his pipe
at the Battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere else,even
with a learned air,as if he considered himself to be advancing
immensely. Dear fellow, I hope he did.
 
It was pleasant and quiet, out there with the sails on the river passing
beyond the earthwork, and sometimes, when the tide was low, looking
as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the
bottom of the water. Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea
with their white sails spread, I somehow thought of Miss Havisham and
Estella and whenever the light struck aslant, afar off, upon a cloud
or sail or green hillside or waterline, it was just the same.Miss
Havisham and Estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared
to have something to do with everything that was picturesque.
 
One Sunday when Joe, greatly enjoying his pipe, had so plumed himself on
being "most awful dull," that I had given him up for the day, I lay on
the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand, descrying traces of
Miss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect, in the sky and in the
water, until at last I resolved to mention a thought concerning them
that had been much in my head.
 
"Joe," said I "dont you think I ought to make Miss Havisham a visit?"
 
"Well, Pip," returned Joe, slowly considering. "What for?"
 
"What for, Joe? What is any visit made for?"
 
"There is some wisits praps," said Joe, "as for ever remains open to
the question, Pip. But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham. She might
think you wanted something,expected something of her."
 
"Dont you think I might say that I did not, Joe?"
 
"You might, old chap," said Joe. "And she might credit it. Similarly she
mightnt."
 
Joe felt, as I did, that he had made a point there, and he pulled hard
at his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition.
 
"You see, Pip," Joe pursued, as soon as he was past that danger, "Miss
Havisham done the handsome thing by you. When Miss Havisham done the
handsome thing by you, she called me back to say to me as that were
all."
 
"Yes, Joe. I heard her."
 
"ALL," Joe repeated, very emphatically.
 
"Yes, Joe. I tell you, I heard her."
 
"Which I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her meaning were,Make a
end on it!As you was!Me to the North, and you to the South!Keep in
sunders!"
 
I had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me
to find that he had thought of it for it seemed to render it more
probable.
 
"But, Joe."
 
"Yes, old chap."
 
"Here am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the day
of my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or asked after
her, or shown that I remember her."
 
"Thats true, Pip and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes
all four round,and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all
four round might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy of
hoofs"
 
"I dont mean that sort of remembrance, Joe I dont mean a present."
 
But Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon it.
"Or even," said he, "if you was helped to knocking her up a new chain
for the front door,or say a gross or two of sharkheaded screws for
general use,or some light fancy article, such as a toastingfork
when she took her muffins,or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such
like"
 
"I dont mean any present at all, Joe," I interposed.
 
"Well," said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularly
pressed it, "if I was yourself, Pip, I wouldnt. No, I would not. For
whats a doorchain when shes got one always up? And sharkheaders is
open to misrepresentations. And if it was a toastingfork, youd go into
brass and do yourself no credit. And the oncommonest workman cant show
himself oncommon in a gridiron,for a gridiron IS a gridiron," said
Joe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he were endeavouring to
rouse me from a fixed delusion, "and you may haim at what you like, but
a gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again your leave,
and you cant help yourself"
 
"My dear Joe," I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat, "dont
go on in that way. I never thought of making Miss Havisham any present."
 
"No, Pip," Joe assented, as if he had been contending for that, all
along "and what I say to you is, you are right, Pip."
 
"Yes, Joe but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack
just now, if you would give me a halfholiday tomorrow, I think I would
go uptown and make a call on Miss EstHavisham."
 
"Which her name," said Joe, gravely, "aint Estavisham, Pip, unless she
have been rechrisened."
 
"I know, Joe, I know. It was a slip of mine. What do you think of it,
Joe?"
 
In brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he thought well of
it. But, he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received
with cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a
visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a
favor received, then this experimental trip should have no successor. By
these conditions I promised to abide.
 
Now, Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick.
He pretended that his Christian name was Dolge,a clear
Impossibility,but he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I
believe him to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular, but
wilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its
understanding. He was a broadshouldered looselimbed swarthy fellow of
great strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching. He never even
seemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by mere
accident and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his dinner, or
went away at night, he would slouch out, like Cain or the Wandering Jew,
as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention of ever
coming back. He lodged at a sluicekeepers out on the marshes, and on
workingdays would come slouching from his hermitage, with his hands in
his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his neck
and dangling on his back. On Sundays he mostly lay all day on the
sluicegates, or stood against ricks and barns. He always slouched,
locomotively, with his eyes on the ground and, when accosted or
otherwise required to raise them, he looked up in a halfresentful,
halfpuzzled way, as though the only thought he ever had was, that it
was rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking.
 
This morose journeyman had no liking for me. When I was very small and
timid, he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner
of the forge, and that he knew the fiend very well also that it was
necessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live boy, and
that I might consider myself fuel. When I became Joes prentice, Orlick
was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace him
howbeit, he liked me still less. Not that he ever said anything, or did
anything, openly importing hostility I only noticed that he always beat
his sparks in my direction, and that whenever I sang Old Clem, he came
in out of time.
 
Dolge Orlick was at work and present, next day, when I reminded Joe of
my halfholiday. He said nothing at the moment, for he and Joe had just
got a piece of hot iron between them, and I was at the bellows but by
and by he said, leaning on his hammer,
 
"Now, master! Sure youre not a going to favor only one of us. If Young
Pip has a halfholiday, do as much for Old Orlick." I suppose he was
about fiveandtwenty, but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient
person.
 
"Why, whatll you do with a halfholiday, if you get it?" said Joe.
 
"Whatll I do with it! Whatll he do with it? Ill do as much with it as
him," said Orlick.
 
"As to Pip, hes going up town," said Joe.
 
"Well then, as to Old Orlick, hes a going up town," retorted that
worthy. "Two can go up town. Taint only one wot can go up town.
 
"Dont lose your temper," said Joe.
 
"Shall if I like," growled Orlick. "Some and their uptowning! Now,
master! Come. No favoring in this shop. Be a man!"
 
The master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in
a better temper, Orlick plunged at the furnace, drew out a redhot
bar, made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body,
whisked it round my head, laid it on the anvil, hammered it out,as
if it were I, I thought, and the sparks were my spirting blood,and
finally said, when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold, and he
again leaned on his hammer,
 
"Now, master!"
 
"Are you all right now?" demanded Joe.
 
"Ah! I am all right," said gruff Old Orlick.
 
"Then, as in general you stick to your work as well as most men," said
Joe, "let it be a halfholiday for all."
 
My sister had been standing silent in the yard, within hearing,she was
a most unscrupulous spy and listener,and she instantly looked in at
one of the windows.
 
"Like you, you fool!" said she to Joe, "giving holidays to great idle
hulkers like that. You are a rich man, upon my life, to waste wages in
that way. I wish I was his master!"
 
"Youd be everybodys master, if you durst," retorted Orlick, with an
illfavored grin.
 
"Let her alone," said Joe.
 
"Id be a match for all noodles and all rogues," returned my sister,
beginning to work herself into a mighty rage. "And I couldnt be a
match for the noodles, without being a match for your master, whos the
dunderheaded king of the noodles. And I couldnt be a match for the
rogues, without being a match for you, who are the blackestlooking and
the worst rogue between this and France. Now!"
 
"Youre a foul shrew, Mother Gargery," growled the journeyman. "If that
makes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a goodun."
 
"Let her alone, will you?" said Joe.
 
"What did you say?" cried my sister, beginning to scream. "What did you
say? What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip? What did he call me,
with my husband standing by? Oh! oh! oh!" Each of these exclamations was
a shriek and I must remark of my sister, what is equally true of all
the violent women I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse for
her, because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, she
consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself
into it, and became blindly furious by regular stages "what was the
name he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me? Oh! Hold me!
Oh!"
 
"Ahhh!" growled the journeyman, between his teeth, "Id hold you, if
you was my wife. Id hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you."
 
"I tell you, let her alone," said Joe.
 
"Oh! To hear him!" cried my sister, with a clap of her hands and a
scream together,which was her next stage. "To hear the names hes
giving me! That Orlick! In my own house! Me, a married woman! With my
husband standing by! Oh! Oh!" Here my sister, after a fit of clappings
and screamings, beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees, and
threw her cap off, and pulled her hair down,which were the last stages
on her road to frenzy. Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete
success, she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.
 
What could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parenthetical
interruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him what he meant
by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe and further whether he was
man enough to come on? Old Orlick felt that the situation admitted of
nothing less than coming on, and was on his defence straightway so,
without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons, they went
at one another, like two giants. But, if any man in that neighborhood
could stand uplong against Joe, I never saw the man. Orlick, as if he
had been of no more account than the pale young gentleman, was very
soon among the coaldust, and in no hurry to come out of it. Then Joe
unlocked the door and picked up my sister, who had dropped insensible
at the window but who had seen the fight first, I think, and who was
carried into the house and laid down, and who was recommended to revive,
and would do nothing but struggle and clench her hands in Joes hair.
Then, came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars and
then, with the vague sensation which I have always connected with such
a lull,namely, that it was Sunday, and somebody was dead,I went up
stairs to dress myself.
 
When I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up, without any
other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlicks nostrils,
which was neither expressive nor ornamental. A pot of beer had appeared
from the Jolly Bargemen, and they were sharing it by turns in a
peaceable manner. The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on
Joe, who followed me out into the road to say, as a parting observation
that might do me good, "On the Rampage, Pip, and off the Rampage,
Pipsuch is Life!"
 
With what absurd emotions for we think the feelings that are very
serious in a man quite comical in a boy I found myself again going to
Miss Havishams, matters little here. Nor, how I passed and repassed
the gate many times before I could make up my mind to ring. Nor, how
I debated whether I should go away without ringing nor, how I should
undoubtedly have gone, if my time had been my own, to come back.
 
Miss Sarah Pocket came to the gate. No Estella.
 
"How, then? You here again?" said Miss Pocket. "What do you want?"
 
When I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was, Sarah
evidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my
business. But unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she let me in, and
presently brought the sharp message that I was to "come up."
 
Everything was unchanged, and Miss Havisham was alone.
 
"Well?" said she, fixing her eyes upon me. "I hope you want nothing?
Youll get nothing."
 
"No indeed, Miss Havisham. I only wanted you to know that I am doing
very well in my apprenticeship, and am always much obliged to you."
 
"There, there!" with the old restless fingers. "Come now and then come
on your birthday.Ay!" she cried suddenly, turning herself and her
chair towards me, "You are looking round for Estella? Hey?"
 
I had been looking round,in fact, for Estella,and I stammered that I
hoped she was well.
 
"Abroad," said Miss Havisham "educating for a lady far out of reach
prettier than ever admired by all who see her. Do you feel that you
have lost her?"
 
There was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last words,
and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at a loss what
to say. She spared me the trouble of considering, by dismissing me. When
the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the walnutshell countenance, I
felt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with
everything and that was all I took by that motion.
 
As I was loitering along the High Street, looking in disconsolately at
the shop windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman,
who should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle. Mr. Wopsle had in
his hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell, in which he had that
moment invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it on
the head of Pumblechook, with whom he was going to drink tea. No sooner
did he see me, than he appeared to consider that a special Providence
had put a prentice in his way to be read at and he laid hold of me,
and insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlor. As I
knew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the
way was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was better
than none, I made no great resistance consequently, we turned into
Pumblechooks just as the street and the shops were lighting up.
 
As I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, I
dont know how long it may usually take but I know very well that it
took until halfpast nine o clock that night, and that when Mr. Wopsle
got into Newgate, I thought he never would go to the scaffold, he became
so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful career. I
thought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short
in his flower after all, as if he had not been running to seed, leaf
after leaf, ever since his course began. This, however, was a
mere question of length and wearisomeness. What stung me, was the
identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self. When
Barnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positively apologetic,
Pumblechooks indignant stare so taxed me with it. Wopsle, too, took
pains to present me in the worst light. At once ferocious and maudlin, I
was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating circumstances whatever
Millwood put me down in argument, on every occasion it became sheer
monomania in my masters daughter to care a button for me and all I can
say for my gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning, is,
that it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character. Even after
I was happily hanged and Wopsle had closed the book, Pumblechook sat
staring at me, and shaking his head, and saying, "Take warning, boy,
take warning!" as if it were a wellknown fact that I contemplated
murdering a near relation, provided I could only induce one to have the
weakness to become my benefactor.
 
It was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out with
Mr. Wopsle on the walk home. Beyond town, we found a heavy mist out, and
it fell wet and thick. The turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out of the
lamps usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substance on
the fog. We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose with a
change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when we came upon
a man, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.
 
"Halloa!" we said, stopping. "Orlick there?"
 
"Ah!" he answered, slouching out. "I was standing by a minute, on the
chance of company."
 
"You are late," I remarked.
 
Orlick not unnaturally answered, "Well? And youre late."
 
"We have been," said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his late performance,"we
have been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual evening."
 
Old Orlick growled, as if he had nothing to say about that, and we all
went on together. I asked him presently whether he had been spending his
halfholiday up and down town?
 
"Yes," said he, "all of it. I come in behind yourself. I didnt see you,
but I must have been pretty close behind you. By the by, the guns is
going again."
 
"At the Hulks?" said I.
 
"Ay! Theres some of the birds flown from the cages. The guns have been
going since dark, about. Youll hear one presently."
 
In effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the
wellremembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily
rolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuing
and threatening the fugitives.
 
"A good night for cutting off in," said Orlick. "Wed be puzzled how to
bring down a jailbird on the wing, tonight."
 
The subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in
silence. Mr. Wopsle, as the illrequited uncle of the evenings tragedy,
fell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell. Orlick, with his
hands in his pockets, slouched heavily at my side. It was very dark,
very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along. Now and then, the sound
of the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled sulkily along
the course of the river. I kept myself to myself and my thoughts. Mr.
Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly game on Bosworth
Field, and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury. Orlick sometimes
growled, "Beat it out, beat it out,Old Clem! With a clink for the
stout,Old Clem!" I thought he had been drinking, but he was not drunk.
 
Thus, we came to the village. The way by which we approached it took us
past the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to findit being
eleven oclockin a state of commotion, with the door wide open, and
unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered
about. Mr. Wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter surmising that
a convict had been taken, but came running out in a great hurry.
 
"Theres something wrong," said he, without stopping, "up at your place,
Pip. Run all!"
 
"What is it?" I asked, keeping up with him. So did Orlick, at my side.
 
"I cant quite understand. The house seems to have been violently
entered when Joe Gargery was out. Supposed by convicts. Somebody has
been attacked and hurt."
 
We were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we made no
stop until we got into our kitchen. It was full of people the whole
village was there, or in the yard and there was a surgeon, and there
was Joe, and there were a group of women, all on the floor in the midst
of the kitchen. The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me,
and so I became aware of my sister,lying without sense or movement on
the bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow
on the back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her face was
turned towards the fire,destined never to be on the Rampage again,
while she was the wife of Joe.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XVI
 
With my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to believe
that I must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister, or at
all events that as her near relation, popularly known to be under
obligations to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than
any one else. But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began to
reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides, I
took another view of the case, which was more reasonable.
 
Joe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from a
quarter after eight oclock to a quarter before ten. While he was there,
my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had exchanged
Good Night with a farmlaborer going home. The man could not be more
particular as to the time at which he saw her he got into dense
confusion when he tried to be, than that it must have been before nine.
When Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he found her struck down
on the floor, and promptly called in assistance. The fire had not then
burnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candle very long the
candle, however, had been blown out.
 
Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyond
the blowing out of the candle,which stood on a table between the door
and my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was
struck,was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such
as she herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one
remarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She had been struck with
something blunt and heavy, on the head and spine after the blows were
dealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable
violence, as she lay on her face. And on the ground beside her, when Joe
picked her up, was a convicts legiron which had been filed asunder.
 
Now, Joe, examining this iron with a smiths eye, declared it to have
been filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to the
Hulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joes opinion
was corroborated. They did not undertake to say when it had left the
prisonships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged but they claimed
to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by
either of the two convicts who had escaped last night. Further, one of
those two was already retaken, and had not freed himself of his iron.
 
Knowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. I believed
the iron to be my convicts iron,the iron I had seen and heard him
filing at, on the marshes,but my mind did not accuse him of having put
it to its latest use. For I believed one of two other persons to have
become possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.
Either Orlick, or the strange man who had shown me the file.
 
Now, as to Orlick he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we
picked him up at the turnpike, he had been seen about town all the
evening, he had been in divers companies in several publichouses, and
he had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle. There was nothing against
him, save the quarrel and my sister had quarrelled with him, and with
everybody else about her, ten thousand times. As to the strange man if
he had come back for his two banknotes there could have been no dispute
about them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore them.
Besides, there had been no altercation the assailant had come in so
silently and suddenly, that she had been felled before she could look
round.
 
It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however
undesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise. I suffered unspeakable
trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I should at last
dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the story. For
months afterwards, I every day settled the question finally in the
negative, and reopened and reargued it next morning. The contention
came, after all, to thisthe secret was such an old one now, had so
grown into me and become a part of myself, that I could not tear it
away. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much mischief,
it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me if he
believed it, I had a further restraining dread that he would not believe
it, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and vealcutlets as a
monstrous invention. However, I temporized with myself, of coursefor,
was I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thing is always
done?and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see any
such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the
assailant.
 
The Constables and the Bow Street men from Londonfor, this happened in
the days of the extinct redwaistcoated policewere about the house for
a week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like
authorities doing in other such cases. They took up several obviously
wrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas,
and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, instead
of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances. Also, they stood
about the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks
that filled the whole neighborhood with admiration and they had a
mysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good as
taking the culprit. But not quite, for they never did it.
 
Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay very
ill in bed. Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objects multiplied,
and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the
realities her hearing was greatly impaired her memory also and her
speech was unintelligible. When, at last, she came round so far as to
be helped down stairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always by
her, that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in
speech. As she was very bad handwriting apart a more than indifferent
speller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader, extraordinary
complications arose between them which I was always called in to solve.
The administration of mutton instead of medicine, the substitution of
Tea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were among the mildest of my own
mistakes.
 
However, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient. A
tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a
part of her regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three
months, she would often put her hands to her head, and would then remain
for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind. We were
at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her, until a circumstance
happened conveniently to relieve us. Mr. Wopsles greataunt conquered a
confirmed habit of living into which she had fallen, and Biddy became a
part of our establishment.
 
It may have been about a month after my sisters reappearance in the
kitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the
whole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.
Above all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly
cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and had
been accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to me
every now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, "Such a fine
figure of a woman as she once were, Pip!" Biddy instantly taking the
cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy Joe
became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life,
and to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that did
him good. It was characteristic of the police people that they had all
more or less suspected poor Joe though he never knew it, and that they
had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits
they had ever encountered.
 
Biddys first triumph in her new office, was to solve a difficulty
that had completely vanquished me. I had tried hard at it, but had made
nothing of it. Thus it was
 
Again and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a
character that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost
eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly
wanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T,
from tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the
sign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my
sisters ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a
qualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one after
another, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the shape
being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and displayed
it to my sister with considerable confidence. But she shook her head to
that extent when she was shown it, that we were terrified lest in her
weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck.
 
When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, this
mysterious sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked thoughtfully
at it, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked
thoughtfully at Joe who was always represented on the slate by his
initial letter, and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me.
 
"Why, of course!" cried Biddy, with an exultant face. "Dont you see?
Its him!"
 
Orlick, without a doubt! She had lost his name, and could only signify
him by his hammer. We told him why we wanted him to come into the
kitchen, and he slowly laid down his hammer, wiped his brow with his
arm, took another wipe at it with his apron, and came slouching
out, with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly
distinguished him.
 
I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him, and that I
was disappointed by the different result. She manifested the greatest
anxiety to be on good terms with him, was evidently much pleased by his
being at length produced, and motioned that she would have him
given something to drink. She watched his countenance as if she were
particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception,
she showed every possible desire to conciliate him, and there was an air
of humble propitiation in all she did, such as I have seen pervade the
bearing of a child towards a hard master. After that day, a day rarely
passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate, and without Orlicks
slouching in and standing doggedly before her, as if he knew no more
than I did what to make of it.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XVII
 
I now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life, which was
varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no more
remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying
another visit to Miss Havisham. I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty
at the gate I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her, and she spoke
of Estella in the very same way, if not in the very same words. The
interview lasted but a few minutes, and she gave me a guinea when I was
going, and told me to come again on my next birthday. I may mention at
once that this became an annual custom. I tried to decline taking the
guinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than causing her
to ask me very angrily, if I expected more? Then, and after that, I took
it.
 
So unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkened
room, the faded spectre in the chair by the dressingtable glass, that
I felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that
mysterious place, and, while I and everything else outside it grew
older, it stood still. Daylight never entered the house as to my
thoughts and remembrances of it, any more than as to the actual fact. It
bewildered me, and under its influence I continued at heart to hate my
trade and to be ashamed of home.
 
Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however. Her
shoes came up at the heel, her hair grew bright and neat, her hands were
always clean. She was not beautiful,she was common, and could not be
like Estella,but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweettempered.
She had not been with us more than a year I remember her being newly
out of mourning at the time it struck me, when I observed to myself one
evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes eyes that
were very pretty and very good.
 
It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring
atwriting some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways at
once by a sort of stratagemand seeing Biddy observant of what I was
about. I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework without
laying it down.
 
"Biddy," said I, "how do you manage it? Either I am very stupid, or you
are very clever."
 
"What is it that I manage? I dont know," returned Biddy, smiling.
 
She managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too but I did not
mean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.
 
"How do you manage, Biddy," said I, "to learn everything that I learn,
and always to keep up with me?" I was beginning to be rather vain of
my knowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the
greater part of my pocketmoney for similar investment though I have no
doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.
 
"I might as well ask you," said Biddy, "how you manage?"
 
"No because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see
me turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy."
 
"I suppose I must catch it like a cough," said Biddy, quietly and went
on with her sewing.
 
Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at
Biddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her rather
an extraordinary girl. For I called to mind now, that she was equally
accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our different
sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I knew, Biddy
knew. Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmith as I, or
better.
 
"You are one of those, Biddy," said I, "who make the most of every
chance. You never had a chance before you came here, and see how
improved you are!"
 
Biddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing. "I was
your first teacher though wasnt I?" said she, as she sewed.
 
"Biddy!" I exclaimed, in amazement. "Why, you are crying!"
 
"No I am not," said Biddy, looking up and laughing. "What put that in
your head?"
 
What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it
dropped on her work? I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had been
until Mr. Wopsles greataunt successfully overcame that bad habit of
living, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I recalled
the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the
miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school,
with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and
shouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there must
have been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first
uneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter of
course. Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I
looked at her and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps
I had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy. I might have been too
reserved, and should have patronized her more though I did not use that
precise word in my meditations with my confidence.
 
"Yes, Biddy," I observed, when I had done turning it over, "you were my
first teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being
together like this, in this kitchen."
 
"Ah, poor thing!" replied Biddy. It was like her selfforgetfulness to
transfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her,
making her more comfortable "thats sadly true!"
 
"Well!" said I, "we must talk together a little more, as we used to do.
And I must consult you a little more, as I used to do. Let us have a
quiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat."
 
My sister was never left alone now but Joe more than readily undertook
the care of her on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went out
together. It was summertime, and lovely weather. When we had passed the
village and the church and the churchyard, and were out on the marshes
and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, I began to
combine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect, in my usual way.
When we came to the riverside and sat down on the bank, with the water
rippling at our feet, making it all more quiet than it would have been
without that sound, I resolved that it was a good time and place for the
admission of Biddy into my inner confidence.
 
"Biddy," said I, after binding her to secrecy, "I want to be a
gentleman."
 
"O, I wouldnt, if I was you!" she returned. "I dont think it would
answer."
 
"Biddy," said I, with some severity, "I have particular reasons for
wanting to be a gentleman."
 
"You know best, Pip but dont you think you are happier as you are?"
 
"Biddy," I exclaimed, impatiently, "I am not at all happy as I am. I
am disgusted with my calling and with my life. I have never taken to
either, since I was bound. Dont be absurd."
 
"Was I absurd?" said Biddy, quietly raising her eyebrows "I am sorry
for that I didnt mean to be. I only want you to do well, and to be
comfortable."
 
"Well, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be
comfortableor anything but miserablethere, Biddy!unless I can lead
a very different sort of life from the life I lead now."
 
"Thats a pity!" said Biddy, shaking her head with a sorrowful air.
 
Now, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kind of
quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was half inclined
to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave utterance to her
sentiment and my own. I told her she was right, and I knew it was much
to be regretted, but still it was not to be helped.
 
"If I could have settled down," I said to Biddy, plucking up the short
grass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings
out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall,"if I could have
settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was
little, I know it would have been much better for me. You and I and Joe
would have wanted nothing then, and Joe and I would perhaps have gone
partners when I was out of my time, and I might even have grown up to
keep company with you, and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine
Sunday, quite different people. I should have been good enough for you
shouldnt I, Biddy?"
 
Biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on, and returned for
answer, "Yes I am not overparticular." It scarcely sounded flattering,
but I knew she meant well.
 
"Instead of that," said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or
two, "see how I am going on. Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable, andwhat
would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody had told me
so!"
 
Biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine, and looked far more
attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships.
 
"It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say," she
remarked, directing her eyes to the ships again. "Who said it?"
 
I was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where
I was going to. It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I
answered, "The beautiful young lady at Miss Havishams, and shes more
beautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her dreadfully, and I want
to be a gentleman on her account." Having made this lunatic confession,
I began to throw my tornup grass into the river, as if I had some
thoughts of following it.
 
"Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?" Biddy
quietly asked me, after a pause.
 
"I dont know," I moodily answered.
 
"Because, if it is to spite her," Biddy pursued, "I should thinkbut
you know bestthat might be better and more independently done by
caring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should
thinkbut you know bestshe was not worth gaining over."
 
Exactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was
perfectly manifest to me at the moment. But how could I, a poor dazed
village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and
wisest of men fall every day?
 
"It may be all quite true," said I to Biddy, "but I admire her
dreadfully."
 
In short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good
grasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well. All the
while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced,
that I was quite conscious it would have served my face right, if I
had lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the pebbles as a
punishment for belonging to such an idiot.
 
Biddy was the wisest of girls, and she tried to reason no more with me.
She put her hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work,
upon my hands, one after another, and gently took them out of my hair.
Then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way, while with my face
upon my sleeve I cried a little,exactly as I had done in the brewery
yard,and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much illused by
somebody, or by everybody I cant say which.
 
"I am glad of one thing," said Biddy, "and that is, that you have felt
you could give me your confidence, Pip. And I am glad of another thing,
and that is, that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it
and always so far deserving it. If your first teacher dear! such a poor
one, and so much in need of being taught herself! had been your teacher
at the present time, she thinks she knows what lesson she would set. But
it would be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond her, and its
of no use now." So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose from the bank,
and said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, "Shall we walk a
little farther, or go home?"
 
"Biddy," I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her neck, and giving
her a kiss, "I shall always tell you everything."
 
"Till youre a gentleman," said Biddy.
 
"You know I never shall be, so thats always. Not that I have any
occasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,as I
told you at home the other night."
 
"Ah!" said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the ships.
And then repeated, with her former pleasant change, "shall we walk a
little farther, or go home?"
 
I said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and the
summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was very
beautiful. I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and
wholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playing
beggar my neighbor by candlelight in the room with the stopped clocks,
and being despised by Estella. I thought it would be very good for me if
I could get her out of my head, with all the rest of those remembrances
and fancies, and could go to work determined to relish what I had to do,
and stick to it, and make the best of it. I asked myself the question
whether I did not surely know that if Estella were beside me at that
moment instead of Biddy, she would make me miserable? I was obliged to
admit that I did know it for a certainty, and I said to myself, "Pip,
what a fool you are!"
 
We talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed
right. Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy today and
somebody else tomorrow she would have derived only pain, and no
pleasure, from giving me pain she would far rather have wounded her own
breast than mine. How could it be, then, that I did not like her much
the better of the two?
 
"Biddy," said I, when we were walking homeward, "I wish you could put me
right."
 
"I wish I could!" said Biddy.
 
"If I could only get myself to fall in love with you,you dont mind my
speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?"
 
"Oh dear, not at all!" said Biddy. "Dont mind me."
 
"If I could only get myself to do it, that would be the thing for me."
 
"But you never will, you see," said Biddy.
 
It did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening, as it would have
done if we had discussed it a few hours before. I therefore observed
I was not quite sure of that. But Biddy said she was, and she said it
decisively. In my heart I believed her to be right and yet I took it
rather ill, too, that she should be so positive on the point.
 
When we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, and
get over a stile near a sluicegate. There started up, from the gate, or
from the rushes, or from the ooze which was quite in his stagnant way,
Old Orlick.
 
"Halloa!" he growled, "where are you two going?"
 
"Where should we be going, but home?"
 
"Well, then," said he, "Im jiggered if I dont see you home!"
 
This penalty of being jiggered was a favorite supposititious case of
his. He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of, but
used it, like his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind, and
convey an idea of something savagely damaging. When I was younger, I
had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, he would
have done it with a sharp and twisted hook.
 
Biddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper,
"Dont let him come I dont like him." As I did not like him either,
I took the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we didnt want
seeing home. He received that piece of information with a yell of
laughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little
distance.
 
Curious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in
that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any
account, I asked her why she did not like him.
 
"Oh!" she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us,
"because II am afraid he likes me."
 
"Did he ever tell you he liked you?" I asked indignantly.
 
"No," said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, "he never told me
so but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye."
 
However novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not
doubt the accuracy of the interpretation. I was very hot indeed upon
Old Orlicks daring to admire her as hot as if it were an outrage on
myself.
 
"But it makes no difference to you, you know," said Biddy, calmly.
 
"No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me only I dont like it I dont
approve of it."
 
"Nor I neither," said Biddy. "Though that makes no difference to you."
 
"Exactly," said I "but I must tell you I should have no opinion of you,
Biddy, if he danced at you with your own consent."
 
I kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances
were favorable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him to obscure that
demonstration. He had struck root in Joes establishment, by reason
of my sisters sudden fancy for him, or I should have tried to get him
dismissed. He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as I
had reason to know thereafter.
 
And now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicated
its confusion fifty thousandfold, by having states and seasons when I
was clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that the
plain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to
be ashamed of, but offered me sufficient means of selfrespect
and happiness. At those times, I would decide conclusively that my
disaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone, and that I was
growing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company
with Biddy,when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the
Havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, and scatter
my wits again. Scattered wits take a long time picking up and often
before I had got them well together, they would be dispersed in all
directions by one stray thought, that perhaps after all Miss Havisham
was going to make my fortune when my time was out.
 
If my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of my
perplexities, I dare say. It never did run out, however, but was brought
to a premature end, as I proceed to relate.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XVIII
 
It was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe, and it was a
Saturday night. There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three
Jolly Bargemen, attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud.
Of that group I was one.
 
A highly popular murder had been committed, and Mr. Wopsle was imbrued
in blood to the eyebrows. He gloated over every abhorrent adjective
in the description, and identified himself with every witness at the
Inquest. He faintly moaned, "I am done for," as the victim, and he
barbarously bellowed, "Ill serve you out," as the murderer. He gave the
medical testimony, in pointed imitation of our local practitioner and
he piped and shook, as the aged turnpikekeeper who had heard blows, to
an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental
competency of that witness. The coroner, in Mr. Wopsles hands, became
Timon of Athens the beadle, Coriolanus. He enjoyed himself thoroughly,
and we all enjoyed ourselves, and were delightfully comfortable. In this
cosey state of mind we came to the verdict Wilful Murder.
 
Then, and not sooner, I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over
the back of the settle opposite me, looking on. There was an expression
of contempt on his face, and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he
watched the group of faces.
 
"Well!" said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle, when the reading was done, "you
have settled it all to your own satisfaction, I have no doubt?"
 
Everybody started and looked up, as if it were the murderer. He looked
at everybody coldly and sarcastically.
 
"Guilty, of course?" said he. "Out with it. Come!"
 
"Sir," returned Mr. Wopsle, "without having the honor of your
acquaintance, I do say Guilty." Upon this we all took courage to unite
in a confirmatory murmur.
 
"I know you do," said the stranger "I knew you would. I told you so.
But now Ill ask you a question. Do you know, or do you not know,
that the law of England supposes every man to be innocent, until he is
provedprovedto be guilty?"
 
"Sir," Mr. Wopsle began to reply, "as an Englishman myself, I"
 
"Come!" said the stranger, biting his forefinger at him. "Dont evade
the question. Either you know it, or you dont know it. Which is it to
be?"
 
He stood with his head on one side and himself on one side, in a
bullying, interrogative manner, and he threw his forefinger at Mr.
Wopsle,as it were to mark him outbefore biting it again.
 
"Now!" said he. "Do you know it, or dont you know it?"
 
"Certainly I know it," replied Mr. Wopsle.
 
"Certainly you know it. Then why didnt you say so at first? Now, Ill
ask you another question,"taking possession of Mr. Wopsle, as if he
had a right to him,"do you know that none of these witnesses have yet
been crossexamined?"
 
Mr. Wopsle was beginning, "I can only say" when the stranger stopped
him.
 
"What? You wont answer the question, yes or no? Now, Ill try you
again." Throwing his finger at him again. "Attend to me. Are you
aware, or are you not aware, that none of these witnesses have yet been
crossexamined? Come, I only want one word from you. Yes, or no?"
 
Mr. Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion
of him.
 
"Come!" said the stranger, "Ill help you. You dont deserve help, but
Ill help you. Look at that paper you hold in your hand. What is it?"
 
"What is it?" repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.
 
"Is it," pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious
manner, "the printed paper you have just been reading from?"
 
"Undoubtedly."
 
"Undoubtedly. Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether it distinctly
states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers
instructed him altogether to reserve his defence?"
 
"I read that just now," Mr. Wopsle pleaded.
 
"Never mind what you read just now, sir I dont ask you what you read
just now. You may read the Lords Prayer backwards, if you like,and,
perhaps, have done it before today. Turn to the paper. No, no, no my
friend not to the top of the column you know better than that to
the bottom, to the bottom." We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full of
subterfuge. "Well? Have you found it?"
 
"Here it is," said Mr. Wopsle.
 
"Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it
distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was
instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence? Come! Do
you make that of it?"
 
Mr. Wopsle answered, "Those are not the exact words."
 
"Not the exact words!" repeated the gentleman bitterly. "Is that the
exact substance?"
 
"Yes," said Mr. Wopsle.
 
"Yes," repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the company
with his right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle. "And now I ask
you what you say to the conscience of that man who, with that passage
before his eyes, can lay his head upon his pillow after having
pronounced a fellowcreature guilty, unheard?"
 
We all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thought
him, and that he was beginning to be found out.
 
"And that same man, remember," pursued the gentleman, throwing his
finger at Mr. Wopsle heavily,"that same man might be summoned as a
juryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committed himself,
might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his
pillow, after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the
issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the prisoner at the
bar, and would a true verdict give according to the evidence, so help
him God!"
 
We were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too
far, and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet
time.
 
The strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and
with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of
us that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose
it, left the back of the settle, and came into the space between the two
settles, in front of the fire, where he remained standing, his left hand
in his pocket, and he biting the forefinger of his right.
 
"From information I have received," said he, looking round at us as we
all quailed before him, "I have reason to believe there is a blacksmith
among you, by name Josephor JoeGargery. Which is the man?"
 
"Here is the man," said Joe.
 
The strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place, and Joe went.
 
"You have an apprentice," pursued the stranger, "commonly known as Pip?
Is he here?"
 
"I am here!" I cried.
 
The stranger did not recognize me, but I recognized him as the gentleman
I had met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visit to Miss
Havisham. I had known him the moment I saw him looking over the settle,
and now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder,
I checked off again in detail his large head, his dark complexion, his
deepset eyes, his bushy black eyebrows, his large watchchain, his
strong black dots of beard and whisker, and even the smell of scented
soap on his great hand.
 
"I wish to have a private conference with you two," said he, when he had
surveyed me at his leisure. "It will take a little time. Perhaps we
had better go to your place of residence. I prefer not to anticipate my
communication here you will impart as much or as little of it as you
please to your friends afterwards I have nothing to do with that."
 
Amidst a wondering silence, we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen,
and in a wondering silence walked home. While going along, the strange
gentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of
his finger. As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as
an impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front door.
Our conference was held in the state parlor, which was feebly lighted by
one candle.
 
It began with the strange gentlemans sitting down at the table, drawing
the candle to him, and looking over some entries in his pocketbook.
He then put up the pocketbook and set the candle a little aside, after
peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, to ascertain which was
which.
 
"My name," he said, "is Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London. I am
pretty well known. I have unusual business to transact with you, and I
commence by explaining that it is not of my originating. If my advice
had been asked, I should not have been here. It was not asked, and you
see me here. What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, I
do. No less, no more."
 
Finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat, he got
up, and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it thus
having one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground.
 
"Now, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of
this young fellow your apprentice. You would not object to cancel his
indentures at his request and for his good? You would want nothing for
so doing?"
 
"Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pips way,"
said Joe, staring.
 
"Lord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose," returned Mr.
Jaggers. "The question is, Would you want anything? Do you want
anything?"
 
"The answer is," returned Joe, sternly, "No."
 
I thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a fool for
his disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered between breathless
curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it.
 
"Very well," said Mr. Jaggers. "Recollect the admission you have made,
and dont try to go from it presently."
 
"Whos a going to try?" retorted Joe.
 
"I dont say anybody is. Do you keep a dog?"
 
"Yes, I do keep a dog."
 
"Bear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.
Bear that in mind, will you?" repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his eyes
and nodding his head at Joe, as if he were forgiving him something.
"Now, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got to
make is, that he has Great Expectations."
 
Joe and I gasped, and looked at one another.
 
"I am instructed to communicate to him," said Mr. Jaggers, throwing
his finger at me sideways, "that he will come into a handsome property.
Further, that it is the desire of the present possessor of that
property, that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of life
and from this place, and be brought up as a gentleman,in a word, as a
young fellow of great expectations."
 
My dream was out my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality Miss
Havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale.
 
"Now, Mr. Pip," pursued the lawyer, "I address the rest of what I have
to say, to you. You are to understand, first, that it is the request
of the person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear
the name of Pip. You will have no objection, I dare say, to your great
expectations being encumbered with that easy condition. But if you have
any objection, this is the time to mention it."
 
My heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my ears,
that I could scarcely stammer I had no objection.
 
"I should think not! Now you are to understand, secondly, Mr. Pip, that
the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound
secret, until the person chooses to reveal it. I am empowered to mention
that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by
word of mouth to yourself. When or where that intention may be carried
out, I cannot say no one can say. It may be years hence. Now, you are
distinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from
making any inquiry on this head, or any allusion or reference, however
distant, to any individual whomsoever as the individual, in all the
communications you may have with me. If you have a suspicion in your own
breast, keep that suspicion in your own breast. It is not the least to
the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are they may be the
strongest and gravest reasons, or they may be mere whim. This is not for
you to inquire into. The condition is laid down. Your acceptance of it,
and your observance of it as binding, is the only remaining condition
that I am charged with, by the person from whom I take my instructions,
and for whom I am not otherwise responsible. That person is the person
from whom you derive your expectations, and the secret is solely held by
that person and by me. Again, not a very difficult condition with which
to encumber such a rise in fortune but if you have any objection to it,
this is the time to mention it. Speak out."
 
Once more, I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection.
 
"I should think not! Now, Mr. Pip, I have done with stipulations."
Though he called me Mr. Pip, and began rather to make up to me, he still
could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion and even now
he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he
spoke, as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my
disparagement, if he only chose to mention them. "We come next, to mere
details of arrangement. You must know that, although I have used
the term expectations more than once, you are not endowed with
expectations only. There is already lodged in my hands a sum of money
amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance. You will
please consider me your guardian. Oh!" for I was going to thank him, "I
tell you at once, I am paid for my services, or I shouldnt render them.
It is considered that you must be better educated, in accordance with
your altered position, and that you will be alive to the importance and
necessity of at once entering on that advantage."
 
I said I had always longed for it.
 
"Never mind what you have always longed for, Mr. Pip," he retorted
"keep to the record. If you long for it now, thats enough. Am I
answered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper
tutor? Is that it?"
 
I stammered yes, that was it.
 
"Good. Now, your inclinations are to be consulted. I dont think that
wise, mind, but its my trust. Have you ever heard of any tutor whom you
would prefer to another?"
 
I had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsles greataunt
so, I replied in the negative.
 
"There is a certain tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I think
might suit the purpose," said Mr. Jaggers. "I dont recommend him,
observe because I never recommend anybody. The gentleman I speak of is
one Mr. Matthew Pocket."
 
Ah! I caught at the name directly. Miss Havishams relation. The Matthew
whom Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of. The Matthew whose place was to
be at Miss Havishams head, when she lay dead, in her brides dress on
the brides table.
 
"You know the name?" said Mr. Jaggers, looking shrewdly at me, and then
shutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer.
 
My answer was, that I had heard of the name.
 
"Oh!" said he. "You have heard of the name. But the question is, what do
you say of it?"
 
I said, or tried to say, that I was much obliged to him for his
recommendation
 
"No, my young friend!" he interrupted, shaking his great head very
slowly. "Recollect yourself!"
 
Not recollecting myself, I began again that I was much obliged to him
for his recommendation
 
"No, my young friend," he interrupted, shaking his head and frowning and
smiling both at once,"no, no, no its very well done, but it wont
do you are too young to fix me with it. Recommendation is not the word,
Mr. Pip. Try another."
 
Correcting myself, I said that I was much obliged to him for his mention
of Mr. Matthew Pocket
 
"Thats more like it!" cried Mr. Jaggers.And I added, I would
gladly try that gentleman.
 
"Good. You had better try him in his own house. The way shall be
prepared for you, and you can see his son first, who is in London. When
will you come to London?"
 
I said glancing at Joe, who stood looking on, motionless, that I
supposed I could come directly.
 
"First," said Mr. Jaggers, "you should have some new clothes to come in,
and they should not be workingclothes. Say this day week. Youll want
some money. Shall I leave you twenty guineas?"
 
He produced a long purse, with the greatest coolness, and counted them
out on the table and pushed them over to me. This was the first time he
had taken his leg from the chair. He sat astride of the chair when he
had pushed the money over, and sat swinging his purse and eyeing Joe.
 
"Well, Joseph Gargery? You look dumbfoundered?"
 
"I am!" said Joe, in a very decided manner.
 
"It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?"
 
"It were understood," said Joe. "And it are understood. And it ever will
be similar according."
 
"But what," said Mr. Jaggers, swinging his purse,"what if it was in my
instructions to make you a present, as compensation?"
 
"As compensation what for?" Joe demanded.
 
"For the loss of his services."
 
Joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman. I have
often thought him since, like the steamhammer that can crush a man or
pat an eggshell, in his combination of strength with gentleness. "Pip
is that hearty welcome," said Joe, "to go free with his services, to
honor and fortun, as no words can tell him. But if you think as Money
can make compensation to me for the loss of the little childwhat come
to the forgeand ever the best of friends!"
 
O dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, I
see you again, with your muscular blacksmiths arm before your eyes,
and your broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away. O dear good
faithful tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm,
as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angels wing!
 
But I encouraged Joe at the time. I was lost in the mazes of my future
fortunes, and could not retrace the bypaths we had trodden together. I
begged Joe to be comforted, for as he said we had ever been the best
of friends, and as I said we ever would be so. Joe scooped his eyes
with his disengaged wrist, as if he were bent on gouging himself, but
said not another word.
 
Mr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognized in Joe the
village idiot, and in me his keeper. When it was over, he said, weighing
in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing
 
"Now, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance. No half
measures with me. If you mean to take a present that I have it in charge
to make you, speak out, and you shall have it. If on the contrary you
mean to say" Here, to his great amazement, he was stopped by Joes
suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic
purpose.
 
"Which I meantersay," cried Joe, "that if you come into my place
bullbaiting and badgering me, come out! Which I meantersay as sech if
youre a man, come on! Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay
and stand or fall by!"
 
I drew Joe away, and he immediately became placable merely stating to
me, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any
one whom it might happen to concern, that he were not a going to be
bullbaited and badgered in his own place. Mr. Jaggers had risen when
Joe demonstrated, and had backed near the door. Without evincing
any inclination to come in again, he there delivered his valedictory
remarks. They were these.
 
"Well, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave hereas you are to be a
gentlemanthe better. Let it stand for this day week, and you shall
receive my printed address in the meantime. You can take a hackneycoach
at the stagecoach office in London, and come straight to me.
Understand, that I express no opinion, one way or other, on the trust
I undertake. I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so. Now, understand
that, finally. Understand that!"
 
He was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have gone
on, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.
 
Something came into my head which induced me to run after him, as he was
going down to the Jolly Bargemen, where he had left a hired carriage.
 
"I beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers."
 
"Halloa!" said he, facing round, "whats the matter?"
 
"I wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions
so I thought I had better ask. Would there be any objection to my taking
leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?"
 
"No," said he, looking as if he hardly understood me.
 
"I dont mean in the village only, but up town?"
 
"No," said he. "No objection."
 
I thanked him and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had already
locked the front door and vacated the state parlor, and was seated
by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at the
burning coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals,
and nothing was said for a long time.
 
My sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat at her
needlework before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat next Joe
in the corner opposite my sister. The more I looked into the glowing
coals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe the longer the
silence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.
 
At length I got out, "Joe, have you told Biddy?"
 
"No, Pip," returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his
knees tight, as if he had private information that they intended to make
off somewhere, "which I left it to yourself, Pip."
 
"I would rather you told, Joe."
 
"Pips a gentleman of fortun then," said Joe, "and God bless him in
it!"
 
Biddy dropped her work, and looked at me. Joe held his knees and looked
at me. I looked at both of them. After a pause, they both heartily
congratulated me but there was a certain touch of sadness in their
congratulations that I rather resented.
 
I took it upon myself to impress Biddy and through Biddy, Joe with the
grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and say
nothing about the maker of my fortune. It would all come out in good
time, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said, save
that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron. Biddy
nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again,
and said she would be very particular and Joe, still detaining his
knees, said, "Ay, ay, Ill be ekervally partickler, Pip" and then they
congratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder at the
notion of my being a gentleman that I didnt half like it.
 
Infinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some idea
of what had happened. To the best of my belief, those efforts entirely
failed. She laughed and nodded her head a great many times, and even
repeated after Biddy, the words "Pip" and "Property." But I doubt if
they had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I cannot suggest
a darker picture of her state of mind.
 
I never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and
Biddy became more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.
Dissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be but it is
possible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied
with myself.
 
Any how, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand,
looking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, and
about what they should do without me, and all that. And whenever I
caught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly and they
often looked at me,particularly Biddy, I felt offended as if they
were expressing some mistrust of me. Though Heaven knows they never did
by word or sign.
 
At those times I would get up and look out at the door for our kitchen
door opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings to
air the room. The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am afraid
I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic
objects among which I had passed my life.
 
"Saturday night," said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese
and beer. "Five more days, and then the day before the day! Theyll soon
go."
 
"Yes, Pip," observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beermug.
"Theyll soon go."
 
"Soon, soon go," said Biddy.
 
"I have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, and
order my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that Ill come and put
them on there, or that Ill have them sent to Mr. Pumblechooks. It
would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here."
 
"Mr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new genteel figure
too, Pip," said Joe, industriously cutting his bread, with his cheese on
it, in the palm of his left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper
as if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices. "So might
Wopsle. And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment."
 
"Thats just what I dont want, Joe. They would make such a business of
it,such a coarse and common business,that I couldnt bear myself."
 
"Ah, that indeed, Pip!" said Joe. "If you couldnt abear yourself"
 
Biddy asked me here, as she sat holding my sisters plate, "Have you
thought about when youll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sister
and me? You will show yourself to us wont you?"
 
"Biddy," I returned with some resentment, "you are so exceedingly quick
that its difficult to keep up with you."
 
"She always were quick," observed Joe.
 
"If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say
that I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,most likely
on the evening before I go away."
 
Biddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged an
affectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed. When I got
into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a mean
little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above, for
ever. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even at
the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind
between it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in
so often between the forge and Miss Havishams, and Biddy and Estella.
 
The sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and
the room was warm. As I put the window open and stood looking out, I saw
Joe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or two
in the air and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and light
it for him. He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me that he
wanted comforting, for some reason or other.
 
He presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his pipe,
and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knew that they
talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both
of them more than once. I would not have listened for more, if I could
have heard more so I drew away from the window, and sat down in my one
chair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this
first night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest I had ever
known.
 
Looking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joes pipe
floating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,not
obtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared
together. I put my light out, and crept into bed and it was an uneasy
bed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XIX
 
Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life,
and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same. What lay
heaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervened
between me and the day of departure for I could not divest myself of
a misgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile, and
that, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean
gone.
 
Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our
approaching separation but they only referred to it when I did. After
breakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best
parlor, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free. With
all the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe, and
thought perhaps the clergyman wouldnt have read that about the rich man
and the kingdom of Heaven, if he had known all.
 
After our early dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing to finish off
the marshes at once, and get them done with. As I passed the church, I
felt as I had felt during service in the morning a sublime compassion
for the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after
Sunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the
low green mounds. I promised myself that I would do something for them
one of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a
dinner of roastbeef and plumpudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of
condescension, upon everybody in the village.
 
If I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of my
companionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among those
graves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the place recalled
the wretch, ragged and shivering, with his felon iron and badge! My
comfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that he had doubtless
been transported a long way off, and that he was dead to me, and might
be veritably dead into the bargain.
 
No more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more of these
grazing cattle,though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a
more respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they
might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great
expectations,farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood,
henceforth I was for London and greatness not for smiths work in
general, and for you! I made my exultant way to the old Battery, and,
lying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham intended
me for Estella, fell asleep.
 
When I awoke, I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me,
smoking his pipe. He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my
eyes, and said,
 
"As being the last time, Pip, I thought Id foller."
 
"And Joe, I am very glad you did so."
 
"Thankee, Pip."
 
"You may be sure, dear Joe," I went on, after we had shaken hands, "that
I shall never forget you."
 
"No, no, Pip!" said Joe, in a comfortable tone, "Im sure of that. Ay,
ay, old chap! Bless you, it were only necessary to get it well round in
a mans mind, to be certain on it. But it took a bit of time to get it
well round, the change come so oncommon plump didnt it?"
 
Somehow, I was not best pleased with Joes being so mightily secure of
me. I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion, or to have said,
"It does you credit, Pip," or something of that sort. Therefore, I made
no remark on Joes first head merely saying as to his second, that the
tidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be a
gentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if I
were one.
 
"Have you though?" said Joe. "Astonishing!"
 
"Its a pity now, Joe," said I, "that you did not get on a little more,
when we had our lessons here isnt it?"
 
"Well, I dont know," returned Joe. "Im so awful dull. Im only master
of my own trade. It were always a pity as I was so awful dull but its
no more of a pity now, than it wasthis day twelvemonthdont you
see?"
 
What I had meant was, that when I came into my property and was able to
do something for Joe, it would have been much more agreeable if he
had been better qualified for a rise in station. He was so perfectly
innocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it to
Biddy in preference.
 
So, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into our
little garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in a
general way for the elevation of her spirits, that I should never forget
her, said I had a favor to ask of her.
 
"And it is, Biddy," said I, "that you will not omit any opportunity of
helping Joe on, a little."
 
"How helping him on?" asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance.
 
"Well! Joe is a dear good fellow,in fact, I think he is the dearest
fellow that ever lived,but he is rather backward in some things. For
instance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners."
 
Although I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she opened her
eyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at me.
 
"O, his manners! wont his manners do then?" asked Biddy, plucking a
blackcurrant leaf.
 
"My dear Biddy, they do very well here"
 
"O! they do very well here?" interrupted Biddy, looking closely at the
leaf in her hand.
 
"Hear me out,but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as I
shall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they would
hardly do him justice."
 
"And dont you think he knows that?" asked Biddy.
 
It was such a very provoking question for it had never in the most
distant manner occurred to me, that I said, snappishly,
 
"Biddy, what do you mean?"
 
Biddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,and the
smell of a blackcurrant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening
in the little garden by the side of the lane,said, "Have you never
considered that he may be proud?"
 
"Proud?" I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.
 
"O! there are many kinds of pride," said Biddy, looking full at me and
shaking her head "pride is not all of one kind"
 
"Well? What are you stopping for?" said I.
 
"Not all of one kind," resumed Biddy. "He may be too proud to let any
one take him out of a place that he is competent to fill, and fills well
and with respect. To tell you the truth, I think he is though it sounds
bold in me to say so, for you must know him far better than I do."
 
"Now, Biddy," said I, "I am very sorry to see this in you. I did not
expect to see this in you. You are envious, Biddy, and grudging. You
are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you cant help
showing it."
 
"If you have the heart to think so," returned Biddy, "say so. Say so
over and over again, if you have the heart to think so."
 
"If you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy," said I, in a virtuous
and superior tone "dont put it off upon me. I am very sorry to see it,
and its aits a bad side of human nature. I did intend to ask you
to use any little opportunities you might have after I was gone, of
improving dear Joe. But after this I ask you nothing. I am extremely
sorry to see this in you, Biddy," I repeated. "Its aits a bad side
of human nature."
 
"Whether you scold me or approve of me," returned poor Biddy, "you may
equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here,
at all times. And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make
no difference in my remembrance of you. Yet a gentleman should not be
unjust neither," said Biddy, turning away her head.
 
I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature in which
sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to think I
was right, and I walked down the little path away from Biddy, and
Biddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and took a
dejected stroll until suppertime again feeling it very sorrowful and
strange that this, the second night of my bright fortunes, should be as
lonely and unsatisfactory as the first.
 
But, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemency to
Biddy, and we dropped the subject. Putting on the best clothes I had,
I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open,
and presented myself before Mr. Trabb, the tailor, who was having his
breakfast in the parlor behind his shop, and who did not think it worth
his while to come out to me, but called me in to him.
 
"Well!" said Mr. Trabb, in a hailfellowwellmet kind of way. "How are
you, and what can I do for you?"
 
Mr. Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three featherbeds, and was
slipping butter in between the blankets, and covering it up. He was a
prosperous old bachelor, and his open window looked into a prosperous
little garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe let into
the wall at the side of his fireplace, and I did not doubt that heaps of
his prosperity were put away in it in bags.
 
"Mr. Trabb," said I, "its an unpleasant thing to have to mention,
because it looks like boasting but I have come into a handsome
property."
 
A change passed over Mr. Trabb. He forgot the butter in bed, got up from
the bedside, and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth, exclaiming, "Lord
bless my soul!"
 
"I am going up to my guardian in London," said I, casually drawing some
guineas out of my pocket and looking at them "and I want a fashionable
suit of clothes to go in. I wish to pay for them," I addedotherwise I
thought he might only pretend to make them, "with ready money."
 
"My dear sir," said Mr. Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body, opened
his arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each
elbow, "dont hurt me by mentioning that. May I venture to congratulate
you? Would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop?"
 
Mr. Trabbs boy was the most audacious boy in all that countryside.
When I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had sweetened his
labors by sweeping over me. He was still sweeping when I came out into
the shop with Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the broom against all possible
corners and obstacles, to express as I understood it equality with any
blacksmith, alive or dead.
 
"Hold that noise," said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, "or Ill
knock your head off!Do me the favor to be seated, sir. Now, this,"
said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out in a
flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his hand under
it to show the gloss, "is a very sweet article. I can recommend it for
your purpose, sir, because it really is extra super. But you shall
see some others. Give me Number Four, you!" To the boy, and with a
dreadfully severe stare foreseeing the danger of that miscreants
brushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.
 
Mr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had
deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.
Then he commanded him to bring number five, and number eight. "And let
me have none of your tricks here," said Mr. Trabb, "or you shall repent
it, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live."
 
Mr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential
confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an
article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that
it would ever be an honor to him to reflect upon a distinguished
fellowtownsmans if he might claim me for a fellowtownsman having
worn. "Are you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond," said Mr.
Trabb to the boy after that, "or shall I kick you out of the shop and
bring them myself?"
 
I selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabbs
judgment, and reentered the parlor to be measured. For although Mr.
Trabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented
with it, he said apologetically that it "wouldnt do under existing
circumstances, sir,wouldnt do at all." So, Mr. Trabb measured and
calculated me in the parlor, as if I were an estate and he the finest
species of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that
I felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his
pains. When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles
to Mr. Pumblechooks on the Thursday evening, he said, with his hand
upon the parlor lock, "I know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be
expected to patronize local work, as a rule but if you would give me a
turn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem
it. Good morning, sir, much obliged.Door!"
 
The last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what
it meant. But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his
hands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money
was, that it had morally laid upon his back Trabbs boy.
 
After this memorable event, I went to the hatters, and the bootmakers,
and the hosiers, and felt rather like Mother Hubbards dog whose outfit
required the services of so many trades. I also went to the coachoffice
and took my place for seven oclock on Saturday morning. It was
not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come into a handsome
property but whenever I said anything to that effect, it followed that
the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through
the window by the High Street, and concentrated his mind upon me. When
I had ordered everything I wanted, I directed my steps towards
Pumblechooks, and, as I approached that gentlemans place of business,
I saw him standing at his door.
 
He was waiting for me with great impatience. He had been out early with
the chaisecart, and had called at the forge and heard the news. He had
prepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlor, and he too ordered
his shopman to "come out of the gangway" as my sacred person passed.
 
"My dear friend," said Mr. Pumblechook, taking me by both hands, when
he and I and the collation were alone, "I give you joy of your good
fortune. Well deserved, well deserved!"
 
This was coming to the point, and I thought it a sensible way of
expressing himself.
 
"To think," said Mr. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at me for
some moments, "that I should have been the humble instrument of leading
up to this, is a proud reward."
 
I begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or
hinted, on that point.
 
"My dear young friend," said Mr. Pumblechook "if you will allow me to
call you so"
 
I murmured "Certainly," and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both hands again,
and communicated a movement to his waistcoat, which had an emotional
appearance, though it was rather low down, "My dear young friend, rely
upon my doing my little all in your absence, by keeping the fact before
the mind of Joseph.Joseph!" said Mr. Pumblechook, in the way of a
compassionate adjuration. "Joseph!! Joseph!!!" Thereupon he shook his
head and tapped it, expressing his sense of deficiency in Joseph.
 
"But my dear young friend," said Mr. Pumblechook, "you must be hungry,
you must be exhausted. Be seated. Here is a chicken had round from the
Boar, here is a tongue had round from the Boar, heres one or two little
things had round from the Boar, that I hope you may not despise. But do
I," said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again the moment after he had sat
down, "see afore me, him as I ever sported with in his times of happy
infancy? And may Imay I?"
 
This May I, meant might he shake hands? I consented, and he was fervent,
and then sat down again.
 
"Here is wine," said Mr. Pumblechook. "Let us drink, Thanks to Fortune,
and may she ever pick out her favorites with equal judgment! And yet I
cannot," said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, "see afore me Oneand
likewise drink to Onewithout again expressingMay Imay I?"
 
I said he might, and he shook hands with me again, and emptied his glass
and turned it upside down. I did the same and if I had turned myself
upside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone more direct to
my head.
 
Mr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of
tongue none of those outoftheway No Thoroughfares of Pork now, and
took, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all. "Ah! poultry,
poultry! You little thought," said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophizing the
fowl in the dish, "when you was a young fledgling, what was in store for
you. You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this humble
roof for one asCall it a weakness, if you will," said Mr. Pumblechook,
getting up again, "but may I? may I?"
 
It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might, so
he did it at once. How he ever did it so often without wounding himself
with my knife, I dont know.
 
"And your sister," he resumed, after a little steady eating, "which had
the honor of bringing you up by hand! Its a sad picter, to reflect that
shes no longer equal to fully understanding the honor. May"
 
I saw he was about to come at me again, and I stopped him.
 
"Well drink her health," said I.
 
"Ah!" cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his chair, quite flaccid
with admiration, "thats the way you know em, sir!" I dont know
who Sir was, but he certainly was not I, and there was no third person
present "thats the way you know the nobleminded, sir! Ever forgiving
and ever affable. It might," said the servile Pumblechook, putting down
his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, "to a common person,
have the appearance of repeatingbut may I?"
 
When he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister. "Let us
never be blind," said Mr. Pumblechook, "to her faults of temper, but it
is to be hoped she meant well."
 
At about this time, I began to observe that he was getting flushed in
the face as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.
 
I mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes
sent to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him. I
mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village,
and he lauded it to the skies. There was nobody but himself, he
intimated, worthy of my confidence, andin short, might he? Then he
asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we
had gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how he
had ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend? If I had taken
ten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that he
never had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart of
hearts have repudiated the idea. Yet for all that, I remember feeling
convinced that I had been much mistaken in him, and that he was a
sensible, practical, goodhearted prime fellow.
 
By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to ask my
advice in reference to his own affairs. He mentioned that there was an
opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed
trade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurred
before in that or any other neighborhood. What alone was wanting to the
realization of a vast fortune, he considered to be More Capital.
Those were the two little words, more capital. Now it appeared to him
Pumblechook that if that capital were got into the business, through a
sleeping partner, sir,which sleeping partner would have nothing to
do but walk in, by self or deputy, whenever he pleased, and examine
the books,and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his
pocket, to the tune of fifty per cent,it appeared to him that that
might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with
property, which would be worthy of his attention. But what did I think?
He had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think? I gave it
as my opinion. "Wait a bit!" The united vastness and distinctness of
this view so struck him, that he no longer asked if he might shake hands
with me, but said he really must,and did.
 
We drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and over
again to keep Joseph up to the mark I dont know what mark, and to
render me efficient and constant service I dont know what service. He
also made known to me for the first time in my life, and certainly after
having kept his secret wonderfully well, that he had always said of me,
"That boy is no common boy, and mark me, his fortun will be no common
fortun." He said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to
think of now, and I said so too. Finally, I went out into the air, with
a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the
sunshine, and found that I had slumberously got to the turnpike without
having taken any account of the road.
 
There, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechooks hailing me. He was a long way
down the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me to
stop. I stopped, and he came up breathless.
 
"No, my dear friend," said he, when he had recovered wind for speech.
"Not if I can help it. This occasion shall not entirely pass without
that affability on your part.May I, as an old friend and wellwisher?
May I?"
 
We shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and he ordered a young
carter out of my way with the greatest indignation. Then, he blessed
me and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the
road and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge
before I pursued my way home.
 
I had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the little
I possessed was adapted to my new station. But I began packing that same
afternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want next
morning, in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost.
 
So, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed and on Friday morning I
went to Mr. Pumblechooks, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to
Miss Havisham. Mr. Pumblechooks own room was given up to me to dress
in, and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event. My
clothes were rather a disappointment, of course. Probably every new
and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell
a trifle short of the wearers expectation. But after I had had my
new suit on some half an hour, and had gone through an immensity of
posturing with Mr. Pumblechooks very limited dressingglass, in the
futile endeavor to see my legs, it seemed to fit me better. It being
market morning at a neighboring town some ten miles off, Mr. Pumblechook
was not at home. I had not told him exactly when I meant to leave, and
was not likely to shake hands with him again before departing. This was
all as it should be, and I went out in my new array, fearfully ashamed
of having to pass the shopman, and suspicious after all that I was at a
personal disadvantage, something like Joes in his Sunday suit.
 
I went circuitously to Miss Havishams by all the back ways, and rang
at the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of my
gloves. Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back when
she saw me so changed her walnutshell countenance likewise turned from
brown to green and yellow.
 
"You?" said she. "You? Good gracious! What do you want?"
 
"I am going to London, Miss Pocket," said I, "and want to say good by to
Miss Havisham."
 
I was not expected, for she left me locked in the yard, while she went
to ask if I were to be admitted. After a very short delay, she returned
and took me up, staring at me all the way.
 
Miss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread
table, leaning on her crutch stick. The room was lighted as of yore, and
at the sound of our entrance, she stopped and turned. She was then just
abreast of the rotted bridecake.
 
"Dont go, Sarah," she said. "Well, Pip?"
 
"I start for London, Miss Havisham, tomorrow," I was exceedingly
careful what I said, "and I thought you would kindly not mind my taking
leave of you."
 
"This is a gay figure, Pip," said she, making her crutch stick play
round me, as if she, the fairy godmother who had changed me, were
bestowing the finishing gift.
 
"I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss
Havisham," I murmured. "And I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham!"
 
"Ay, ay!" said she, looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah, with
delight. "I have seen Mr. Jaggers. I have heard about it, Pip. So you go
tomorrow?"
 
"Yes, Miss Havisham."
 
"And you are adopted by a rich person?"
 
"Yes, Miss Havisham."
 
"Not named?"
 
"No, Miss Havisham."
 
"And Mr. Jaggers is made your guardian?"
 
"Yes, Miss Havisham."
 
She quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was her
enjoyment of Sarah Pockets jealous dismay. "Well!" she went on "you
have a promising career before you. Be gooddeserve itand abide by
Mr. Jaggerss instructions." She looked at me, and looked at Sarah, and
Sarahs countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile. "Good
by, Pip!you will always keep the name of Pip, you know."
 
"Yes, Miss Havisham."
 
"Good by, Pip!"
 
She stretched out her hand, and I went down on my knee and put it to
my lips. I had not considered how I should take leave of her it came
naturally to me at the moment to do this. She looked at Sarah Pocket
with triumph in her weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, with
both her hands on her crutch stick, standing in the midst of the dimly
lighted room beside the rotten bridecake that was hidden in cobwebs.
 
Sarah Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must be seen
out. She could not get over my appearance, and was in the last degree
confounded. I said "Good by, Miss Pocket" but she merely stared, and
did not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken. Clear of the
house, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechooks, took off my new
clothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress,
carrying itto speak the truthmuch more at my ease too, though I had
the bundle to carry.
 
And now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had
run out fast and were gone, and tomorrow looked me in the face more
steadily than I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindled
away, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more
appreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, I
dressed my self out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my
splendor until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion, graced by
the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish with. We were
all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits.
 
I was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little
handportmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all
alone. I am afraidsore afraidthat this purpose originated in my
sense of the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to
the coach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing
of this taint in the arrangement but when I went up to my little room
on this last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and
had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me
in the morning. I did not.
 
All night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places
instead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now
pigs, now men,never horses. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied
me until the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up and
partly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in
taking it fell asleep.
 
Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not
sleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when
I started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon.
But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking of the
teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go down stairs.
After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping
my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again, until Biddy
called to me that I was late.
 
It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the meal,
saying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me,
"Well! I suppose I must be off!" and then I kissed my sister who was
laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed
Biddy, and threw my arms around Joes neck. Then I took up my little
portmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them was, when I presently
heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing an old
shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stopped then, to
wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above his head,
crying huskily "Hooroar!" and Biddy put her apron to her face.
 
I walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had
supposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to
have had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High
Street. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was very
peaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to
show me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all
beyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave
and sob I broke into tears. It was by the fingerpost at the end of the
village, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, "Good by, O my dear, dear
friend!"
 
Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain
upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was
better after I had cried than before,more sorry, more aware of my own
ingratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have had Joe
with me then.
 
So subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in the
course of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it was clear
of the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would not get
down when we changed horses and walk back, and have another evening at
home, and a better parting. We changed, and I had not made up my mind,
and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to
get down and walk back, when we changed again. And while I was occupied
with these deliberations, I would fancy an exact resemblance to Joe
in some man coming along the road towards us, and my heart would beat
high.As if he could possibly be there!
 
We changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to
go back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and
the world lay spread before me.
 
This is the end of the first stage of Pips expectations.
 
Chapter XX
 
The journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five
hours. It was a little past midday when the fourhorse stagecoach by
which I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about
the Cross Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, London.
 
We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable
to doubt our having and our being the best of everything otherwise,
while I was scared by the immensity of London, I think I might have had
some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly, crooked, narrow, and
dirty.
 
Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address it was, Little Britain, and he
had written after it on his card, "just out of Smithfield, and close by
the coachoffice." Nevertheless, a hackneycoachman, who seemed to have
as many capes to his greasy greatcoat as he was years old, packed me
up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of
steps, as if he were going to take me fifty miles. His getting on his
box, which I remember to have been decorated with an old weatherstained
peagreen hammercloth motheaten into rags, was quite a work of time.
It was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets outside, and ragged
things behind for I dont know how many footmen to hold on by, and
a harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the
temptation.
 
I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a
strawyard it was, and yet how like a ragshop, and to wonder why
the horses nosebags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman
beginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently. And stop
we presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open
door, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS.
 
"How much?" I asked the coachman.
 
The coachman answered, "A shillingunless you wish to make it more."
 
I naturally said I had no wish to make it more.
 
"Then it must be a shilling," observed the coachman. "I dont want to
get into trouble. I know him!" He darkly closed an eye at Mr. Jaggerss
name, and shook his head.
 
When he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed the
ascent to his box, and had got away which appeared to relieve his
mind, I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my
hand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?
 
"He is not," returned the clerk. "He is in Court at present. Am I
addressing Mr. Pip?"
 
I signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip.
 
"Mr. Jaggers left word, would you wait in his room. He couldnt say how
long he might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason, his time
being valuable, that he wont be longer than he can help."
 
With those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner
chamber at the back. Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in a
velveteen suit and kneebreeches, who wiped his nose with his sleeve on
being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.
 
"Go and wait outside, Mike," said the clerk.
 
I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting, when the clerk
shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used,
and tossing his fur cap out after him, left me alone.
 
Mr. Jaggerss room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most dismal
place the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head, and the
distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to
peep down at me through it. There were not so many papers about, as I
should have expected to see and there were some odd objects about, that
I should not have expected to see,such as an old rusty pistol, a
sword in a scabbard, several strangelooking boxes and packages, and
two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly swollen, and twitchy
about the nose. Mr. Jaggerss own highbacked chair was of deadly black
horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it, like a coffin and I
fancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and bit his forefinger at
the clients. The room was but small, and the clients seemed to have had
a habit of backing up against the wall the wall, especially opposite to
Mr. Jaggerss chair, being greasy with shoulders. I recalled, too, that
the oneeyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was
the innocent cause of his being turned out.
 
I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggerss
chair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I
called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to
everybody elses disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how many
other clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have
the same detrimental mastery of their fellowcreatures. I wondered what
was the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came
there. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggerss
family, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such
illlooking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the
blacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.
Of course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits may
have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and grit
that lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr.
Jaggerss close room, until I really could not bear the two casts on the
shelf above Mr. Jaggerss chair, and got up and went out.
 
When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I
waited, he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into
Smithfield. So I came into Smithfield and the shameful place, being all
asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to me. So,
I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where
I saw the great black dome of Saint Pauls bulging at me from behind a
grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate Prison. Following
the wall of the jail, I found the roadway covered with straw to deaden
the noise of passing vehicles and from this, and from the quantity of
people standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer, I inferred
that the trials were on.
 
While I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk
minister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a
trial or so informing me that he could give me a front place for half a
crown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice in
his wig and robes,mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and
presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteenpence. As I
declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he was so good as
to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and also
where people were publicly whipped, and then he showed me the Debtors
Door, out of which culprits came to be hanged heightening the interest
of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that "four on em"
would come out at that door the day after tomorrow at eight in the
morning, to be killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave me a
sickening idea of London the more so as the Lord Chief Justices
proprietor wore from his hat down to his boots and up again to his
pockethandkerchief inclusive mildewed clothes which had evidently
not belonged to him originally, and which I took it into my head he had
bought cheap of the executioner. Under these circumstances I thought
myself well rid of him for a shilling.
 
I dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and I
found he had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the tour
of Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close and now I became
aware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well
as I. There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew
Close, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the
pavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other when
they first passed me, that "Jaggers would do it if it was to be done."
There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, and
one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comforted
her by saying, as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, "Jaggers
is for him, Melia, and what more could you have?" There was a redeyed
little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there, in
company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand and
while the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of a highly
excitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under a lamppost and
accompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with the words, "O Jaggerth,
Jaggerth, Jaggerth! all otherth ith CagMaggerth, give me Jaggerth!"
These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep
impression on me, and I admired and wondered more than ever.
 
At length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close
into Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards
me. All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time, and there
was quite a rush at him. Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder
and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me, addressed
himself to his followers.
 
First, he took the two secret men.
 
"Now, I have nothing to say to you," said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his
finger at them. "I want to know no more than I know. As to the result,
its a tossup. I told you from the first it was a tossup. Have you
paid Wemmick?"
 
"We made the money up this morning, sir," said one of the men,
submissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggerss face.
 
"I dont ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it
up at all. Has Wemmick got it?"
 
"Yes, sir," said both the men together.
 
"Very well then you may go. Now, I wont have it!" said Mr Jaggers,
waving his hand at them to put them behind him. "If you say a word to
me, Ill throw up the case."
 
"We thought, Mr. Jaggers" one of the men began, pulling off his hat.
 
"Thats what I told you not to do," said Mr. Jaggers. "You thought! I
think for you thats enough for you. If I want you, I know where to
find you I dont want you to find me. Now I wont have it. I wont hear
a word."
 
The two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind
again, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.
 
"And now you!" said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on
the two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly
separated,"Oh! Amelia, is it?"
 
"Yes, Mr. Jaggers."
 
"And do you remember," retorted Mr. Jaggers, "that but for me you
wouldnt be here and couldnt be here?"
 
"O yes, sir!" exclaimed both women together. "Lord bless you, sir, well
we knows that!"
 
"Then why," said Mr. Jaggers, "do you come here?"
 
"My Bill, sir!" the crying woman pleaded.
 
"Now, I tell you what!" said Mr. Jaggers. "Once for all. If you dont
know that your Bills in good hands, I know it. And if you come here
bothering about your Bill, Ill make an example of both your Bill and
you, and let him slip through my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?"
 
"O yes, sir! Every farden."
 
"Very well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say another
wordone single wordand Wemmick shall give you your money back."
 
This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately.
No one remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the
skirts of Mr. Jaggerss coat to his lips several times.
 
"I dont know this man!" said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating
strain "What does this fellow want?"
 
"Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?"
 
"Whos he?" said Mr. Jaggers. "Let go of my coat."
 
The suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing
it, replied, "Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate."
 
"Youre too late," said Mr. Jaggers. "I am over the way."
 
"Holy father, Mithter Jaggerth!" cried my excitable acquaintance,
turning white, "dont thay youre again Habraham Latharuth!"
 
"I am," said Mr. Jaggers, "and theres an end of it. Get out of the
way."
 
"Mithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthenth gone to Mithter
Wemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth. Mithter
Jaggerth! Half a quarter of a moment! If youd have the condethenthun to
be bought off from the tother thideat hany thuperior prithe!money
no object!Mithter JaggerthMithter!"
 
My guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference, and
left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot. Without further
interruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk and
the man in velveteen with the fur cap.
 
"Heres Mike," said the clerk, getting down from his stool, and
approaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially.
 
"Oh!" said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock of
hair in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling
at the bellrope "your man comes on this afternoon. Well?"
 
"Well, Masr Jaggers," returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from a
constitutional cold "arter a deal o trouble, Ive found one, sir, as
might do."
 
"What is he prepared to swear?"
 
"Well, Masr Jaggers," said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap this
time "in a general way, anythink."
 
Mr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate. "Now, I warned you before," said
he, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client, "that if you ever
presumed to talk in that way here, Id make an example of you. You
infernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that?"
 
The client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he were unconscious
what he had done.
 
"Spooney!" said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him a stir with his
elbow. "Soft Head! Need you say it face to face?"
 
"Now, I ask you, you blundering booby," said my guardian, very sternly,
"once more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here is
prepared to swear?"
 
Mike looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a lesson
from his face, and slowly replied, "Ayther to character, or to having
been in his company and never left him all the night in question."
 
"Now, be careful. In what station of life is this man?"
 
Mike looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the
ceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before
beginning to reply in a nervous manner, "Weve dressed him up like"
when my guardian blustered out,
 
"What? You WILL, will you?"
 
"Spooney!" added the clerk again, with another stir.
 
After some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again
 
"He is dressed like a spectable pieman. A sort of a pastrycook."
 
"Is he here?" asked my guardian.
 
"I left him," said Mike, "a setting on some doorsteps round the corner."
 
"Take him past that window, and let me see him."
 
The window indicated was the office window. We all three went to
it, behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an
accidental manner, with a murderouslooking tall individual, in a short
suit of white linen and a paper cap. This guileless confectioner was not
by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery,
which was painted over.
 
"Tell him to take his witness away directly," said my guardian to the
clerk, in extreme disgust, "and ask him what he means by bringing such a
fellow as that."
 
My guardian then took me into his own room, and while he lunched,
standing, from a sandwichbox and a pocketflask of sherry he seemed to
bully his very sandwich as he ate it, informed me what arrangements he
had made for me. I was to go to "Barnards Inn," to young Mr. Pockets
rooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation I was to
remain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday on Monday I was to go with
him to his fathers house on a visit, that I might try how I liked it.
Also, I was told what my allowance was to be,it was a very liberal
one,and had handed to me from one of my guardians drawers, the cards
of certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes,
and such other things as I could in reason want. "You will find your
credit good, Mr. Pip," said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt
like a whole caskful, as he hastily refreshed himself, "but I shall by
this means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find you
outrunning the constable. Of course youll go wrong somehow, but thats
no fault of mine."
 
After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked
Mr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach? He said it was not worth while,
I was so near my destination Wemmick should walk round with me, if I
pleased.
 
I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. Another clerk
was rung down from up stairs to take his place while he was out, and I
accompanied him into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian.
We found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way
among them by saying coolly yet decisively, "I tell you its no use he
wont have a word to say to one of you" and we soon got clear of them,
and went on side by side.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXI
 
Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he was
like in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short in
stature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have been
imperfectly chipped out with a dulledged chisel. There were some marks
in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been softer and
the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints. The chisel
had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose,
but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off. I judged him
to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen, and he appeared
to have sustained a good many bereavements for he wore at least four
mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping
willow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too, that several rings
and seals hung at his watchchain, as if he were quite laden with
remembrances of departed friends. He had glittering eyes,small, keen,
and black,and thin wide mottled lips. He had had them, to the best of
my belief, from forty to fifty years.
 
"So you were never in London before?" said Mr. Wemmick to me.
 
"No," said I.
 
"I was new here once," said Mr. Wemmick. "Rum to think of now!"
 
"You are well acquainted with it now?"
 
"Why, yes," said Mr. Wemmick. "I know the moves of it."
 
"Is it a very wicked place?" I asked, more for the sake of saying
something than for information.
 
"You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London. But there are
plenty of people anywhere, wholl do that for you."
 
"If there is bad blood between you and them," said I, to soften it off a
little.
 
"O! I dont know about bad blood," returned Mr. Wemmick "theres not
much bad blood about. Theyll do it, if theres anything to be got by
it."
 
"That makes it worse."
 
"You think so?" returned Mr. Wemmick. "Much about the same, I should
say."
 
He wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight before him
walking in a selfcontained way as if there were nothing in the streets
to claim his attention. His mouth was such a postoffice of a mouth
that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the top of
Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance,
and that he was not smiling at all.
 
"Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?" I asked Mr. Wemmick.
 
"Yes," said he, nodding in the direction. "At Hammersmith, west of
London."
 
"Is that far?"
 
"Well! Say five miles."
 
"Do you know him?"
 
"Why, youre a regular crossexaminer!" said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me
with an approving air. "Yes, I know him. I know him!"
 
There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of
these words that rather depressed me and I was still looking sideways
at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text,
when he said here we were at Barnards Inn. My depression was not
alleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment
to be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town
was a mere publichouse. Whereas I now found Barnard to be a disembodied
spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby
buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for
Tomcats.
 
We entered this haven through a wicketgate, and were disgorged by an
introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me
like a flat buryingground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in
it, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the most
dismal houses in number half a dozen or so, that I had ever seen. I
thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were
divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain, crippled
flowerpot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable makeshift while
To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms, as if no new
wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of Barnard were
being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants
and their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy mourning of soot
and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard, and it had strewn
ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere
dusthole. Thus far my sense of sight while dry rot and wet rot and all
the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar,rot of rat
and mouse and bug and coachingstables near at hand besidesaddressed
themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned, "Try Barnards
Mixture."
 
So imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations,
that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. "Ah!" said he, mistaking me
"the retirement reminds you of the country. So it does me."
 
He led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,which
appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of
those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find
themselves without the means of coming down,to a set of chambers on
the top floor. MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was
a label on the letterbox, "Return shortly."
 
"He hardly thought youd come so soon," Mr. Wemmick explained. "You
dont want me any more?"
 
"No, thank you," said I.
 
"As I keep the cash," Mr. Wemmick observed, "we shall most likely meet
pretty often. Good day."
 
"Good day."
 
I put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he
thought I wanted something. Then he looked at me, and said, correcting
himself,
 
"To be sure! Yes. Youre in the habit of shaking hands?"
 
I was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion,
but said yes.
 
"I have got so out of it!" said Mr. Wemmick,"except at last. Very
glad, Im sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!"
 
When we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase window
and had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it
came down like the guillotine. Happily it was so quick that I had not
put my head out. After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view
of the Inn through the windows encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully
looking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.
 
Mr. Pocket, Juniors, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly
maddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written
my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the
window, before I heard footsteps on the stairs. Gradually there arose
before me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a
member of society of about my own standing. He had a paperbag under
each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of
breath.
 
"Mr. Pip?" said he.
 
"Mr. Pocket?" said I.
 
"Dear me!" he exclaimed. "I am extremely sorry but I knew there was a
coach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would
come by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account,not
that that is any excuse,for I thought, coming from the country, you
might like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden
Market to get it good."
 
For a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my
head. I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think this
was a dream.
 
"Dear me!" said Mr. Pocket, Junior. "This door sticks so!"
 
As he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while
the paperbags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to hold
them. He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with
the door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last,
that he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite
door, and we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must start out
of my head, and as if this must be a dream.
 
"Pray come in," said Mr. Pocket, Junior. "Allow me to lead the way. I am
rather bare here, but I hope youll be able to make out tolerably well
till Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeably through
tomorrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walk about
London. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. As to our
table, you wont find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied from our
coffeehouse here, and it is only right I should add at your expense,
such being Mr. Jaggerss directions. As to our lodging, its not by
any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my father
hasnt anything to give me, and I shouldnt be willing to take it, if he
had. This is our sittingroom,just such chairs and tables and carpet
and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You mustnt give
me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors, because they come
for you from the coffeehouse. This is my little bedroom rather musty,
but Barnards is musty. This is your bedroom the furnitures hired for
the occasion, but I trust it will answer the purpose if you should want
anything, Ill go and fetch it. The chambers are retired, and we shall
be alone together, but we shant fight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg
your pardon, youre holding the fruit all this time. Pray let me take
these bags from you. I am quite ashamed."
 
As I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags, One,
Two, I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I knew to
be in mine, and he said, falling back,
 
"Lord bless me, youre the prowling boy!"
 
"And you," said I, "are the pale young gentleman!"
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXII
 
The pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in
Barnards Inn, until we both burst out laughing. "The idea of its
being you!" said he. "The idea of its being you!" said I. And then we
contemplated one another afresh, and laughed again. "Well!" said the
pale young gentleman, reaching out his hand goodhumoredly, "its all
over now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if youll forgive me
for having knocked you about so."
 
I derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket for Herbert was the
pale young gentlemans name still rather confounded his intention with
his execution. But I made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly.
 
"You hadnt come into your good fortune at that time?" said Herbert
Pocket.
 
"No," said I.
 
"No," he acquiesced "I heard it had happened very lately. I was rather
on the lookout for good fortune then."
 
"Indeed?"
 
"Yes. Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a fancy to
me. But she couldnt,at all events, she didnt."
 
I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.
 
"Bad taste," said Herbert, laughing, "but a fact. Yes, she had sent for
me on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, I
suppose I should have been provided for perhaps I should have been
whatyoumaycalled it to Estella."
 
"Whats that?" I asked, with sudden gravity.
 
He was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided his
attention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word.
"Affianced," he explained, still busy with the fruit. "Betrothed.
Engaged. Whatshisnamed. Any word of that sort."
 
"How did you bear your disappointment?" I asked.
 
"Pooh!" said he, "I didnt care much for it. Shes a Tartar."
 
"Miss Havisham?"
 
"I dont say no to that, but I meant Estella. That girls hard and
haughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up by
Miss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex."
 
"What relation is she to Miss Havisham?"
 
"None," said he. "Only adopted."
 
"Why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex? What revenge?"
 
"Lord, Mr. Pip!" said he. "Dont you know?"
 
"No," said I.
 
"Dear me! Its quite a story, and shall be saved till dinnertime. And
now let me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did you come
there, that day?"
 
I told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst
out laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I didnt
ask him if he was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly
established.
 
"Mr. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?" he went on.
 
"Yes."
 
"You know he is Miss Havishams man of business and solicitor, and has
her confidence when nobody else has?"
 
This was bringing me I felt towards dangerous ground. I answered with
a constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggers
in Miss Havishams house on the very day of our combat, but never at any
other time, and that I believed he had no recollection of having ever
seen me there.
 
"He was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and he
called on my father to propose it. Of course he knew about my father
from his connection with Miss Havisham. My father is Miss Havishams
cousin not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for he
is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her."
 
Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking.
I had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since,
who more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural
incapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something
wonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the
same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich. I
dont know how this was. I became imbued with the notion on that first
occasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by what
means.
 
He was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered languor
about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that did not seem
indicative of natural strength. He had not a handsome face, but it was
better than handsome being extremely amiable and cheerful. His figure
was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had taken such
liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be light and
young. Whether Mr. Trabbs local work would have sat more gracefully on
him than on me, may be a question but I am conscious that he carried
off his rather old clothes much better than I carried off my new suit.
 
As he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a
bad return unsuited to our years. I therefore told him my small story,
and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was.
I further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a
country place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would
take it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever
he saw me at a loss or going wrong.
 
"With pleasure," said he, "though I venture to prophesy that youll want
very few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I should like
to banish any needless restraint between us. Will you do me the favour
to begin at once to call me by my Christian name, Herbert?"
 
I thanked him and said I would. I informed him in exchange that my
Christian name was Philip.
 
"I dont take to Philip," said he, smiling, "for it sounds like a moral
boy out of the spellingbook, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond,
or so fat that he couldnt see out of his eyes, or so avaricious that
he locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a
birdsnesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the
neighborhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious, and
you have been a blacksmith,would you mind it?"
 
"I shouldnt mind anything that you propose," I answered, "but I dont
understand you."
 
"Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? Theres a charming piece of
music by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith."
 
"I should like it very much."
 
"Then, my dear Handel," said he, turning round as the door opened,
"here is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the table,
because the dinner is of your providing."
 
This I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him. It was a
nice little dinner,seemed to me then a very Lord Mayors Feast,and
it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent
circumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.
This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the
banquet off for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have
said, the lap of luxury,being entirely furnished forth from the
coffeehouse,the circumjacent region of sittingroom was of a
comparatively pastureless and shifty character imposing on the waiter
the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor where he
fell over them, the melted butter in the armchair, the bread on the
bookshelves, the cheese in the coalscuttle, and the boiled fowl into my
bed in the next room,where I found much of its parsley and butter in
a state of congelation when I retired for the night. All this made the
feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my
pleasure was without alloy.
 
We had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of his
promise to tell me about Miss Havisham.
 
"True," he replied. "Ill redeem it at once. Let me introduce the topic,
Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put the
knife in the mouth,for fear of accidents,and that while the fork is
reserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary. It is
scarcely worth mentioning, only its as well to do as other people do.
Also, the spoon is not generally used overhand, but under. This has
two advantages. You get at your mouth better which after all is the
object, and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters, on
the part of the right elbow."
 
He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we both
laughed and I scarcely blushed.
 
"Now," he pursued, "concerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must
know, was a spoilt child. Her mother died when she was a baby, and her
father denied her nothing. Her father was a country gentleman down in
your part of the world, and was a brewer. I dont know why it should
be a crack thing to be a brewer but it is indisputable that while you
cannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was
and brew. You see it every day."
 
"Yet a gentleman may not keep a publichouse may he?" said I.
 
"Not on any account," returned Herbert "but a publichouse may keep a
gentleman. Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was his
daughter."
 
"Miss Havisham was an only child?" I hazarded.
 
"Stop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she was not an only child
she had a halfbrother. Her father privately married againhis cook, I
rather think."
 
"I thought he was proud," said I.
 
"My good Handel, so he was. He married his second wife privately,
because he was proud, and in course of time she died. When she was dead,
I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and then
the son became a part of the family, residing in the house you are
acquainted with. As the son grew a young man, he turned out riotous,
extravagant, undutiful,altogether bad. At last his father disinherited
him but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, though
not nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.Take another glass of wine,
and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one
to be so strictly conscientious in emptying ones glass, as to turn it
bottom upwards with the rim on ones nose."
 
I had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital. I
thanked him, and apologized. He said, "Not at all," and resumed.
 
"Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after
as a great match. Her halfbrother had now ample means again, but what
with debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again.
There were stronger differences between him and her than there had been
between him and his father, and it is suspected that he cherished a deep
and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the fathers anger.
Now, I come to the cruel part of the story,merely breaking off, my
dear Handel, to remark that a dinnernapkin will not go into a tumbler."
 
Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to
say. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a
much better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it
within those limits. Again I thanked him and apologized, and again he
said in the cheerfullest manner, "Not at all, I am sure!" and resumed.
 
"There appeared upon the scenesay at the races, or the public
balls, or anywhere else you likea certain man, who made love to Miss
Havisham. I never saw him for this happened fiveandtwenty years ago,
before you and I were, Handel, but I have heard my father mention that
he was a showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that he was
not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a gentleman, my
father most strongly asseverates because it is a principle of his that
no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever was, since the world
began, a true gentleman in manner. He says, no varnish can hide the
grain of the wood and that the more varnish you put on, the more the
grain will express itself. Well! This man pursued Miss Havisham closely,
and professed to be devoted to her. I believe she had not shown much
susceptibility up to that time but all the susceptibility she possessed
certainly came out then, and she passionately loved him. There is no
doubt that she perfectly idolized him. He practised on her affection in
that systematic way, that he got great sums of money from her, and he
induced her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery which had
been weakly left him by his father at an immense price, on the plea
that when he was her husband he must hold and manage it all. Your
guardian was not at that time in Miss Havishams counsels, and she was
too haughty and too much in love to be advised by any one. Her relations
were poor and scheming, with the exception of my father he was poor
enough, but not timeserving or jealous. The only independent one among
them, he warned her that she was doing too much for this man, and
was placing herself too unreservedly in his power. She took the first
opportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house, in his
presence, and my father has never seen her since."
 
I thought of her having said, "Matthew will come and see me at last when
I am laid dead upon that table" and I asked Herbert whether his father
was so inveterate against her?
 
"Its not that," said he, "but she charged him, in the presence of her
intended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon
her for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it would
look trueeven to himand even to her. To return to the man and make
an end of him. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were
bought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were
invited. The day came, but not the bridegroom. He wrote her a letter"
 
"Which she received," I struck in, "when she was dressing for her
marriage? At twenty minutes to nine?"
 
"At the hour and minute," said Herbert, nodding, "at which she
afterwards stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that
it most heartlessly broke the marriage off, I cant tell you, because I
dont know. When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, she
laid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has never since
looked upon the light of day."
 
"Is that all the story?" I asked, after considering it.
 
"All I know of it and indeed I only know so much, through piecing it
out for myself for my father always avoids it, and, even when Miss
Havisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it was
absolutely requisite I should understand. But I have forgotten one
thing. It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced
confidence acted throughout in concert with her halfbrother that it
was a conspiracy between them and that they shared the profits."
 
"I wonder he didnt marry her and get all the property," said I.
 
"He may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may have
been a part of her halfbrothers scheme," said Herbert. "Mind! I dont
know that."
 
"What became of the two men?" I asked, after again considering the
subject.
 
"They fell into deeper shame and degradationif there can be
deeperand ruin."
 
"Are they alive now?"
 
"I dont know."
 
"You said just now that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, but
adopted. When adopted?"
 
Herbert shrugged his shoulders. "There has always been an Estella, since
I have heard of a Miss Havisham. I know no more. And now, Handel," said
he, finally throwing off the story as it were, "there is a perfectly
open understanding between us. All that I know about Miss Havisham, you
know."
 
"And all that I know," I retorted, "you know."
 
"I fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexity
between you and me. And as to the condition on which you hold your
advancement in life,namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss to
whom you owe it,you may be very sure that it will never be encroached
upon, or even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me."
 
In truth, he said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject
done with, even though I should be under his fathers roof for years and
years to come. Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that I felt
he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as I
understood the fact myself.
 
It had not occurred to me before, that he had led up to the theme for
the purpose of clearing it out of our way but we were so much the
lighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this
to be the case. We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in the
course of conversation, what he was? He replied, "A capitalist,an
Insurer of Ships." I suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search
of some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he added, "In the City."
 
I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in
the City, and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer
on his back, blackened his enterprising eye, and cut his responsible
head open. But again there came upon me, for my relief, that odd
impression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich.
 
"I shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring
ships. I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cut into the
Direction. I shall also do a little in the mining way. None of these
things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own
account. I think I shall trade," said he, leaning back in his chair, "to
the East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, and precious
woods. Its an interesting trade."
 
"And the profits are large?" said I.
 
"Tremendous!" said he.
 
I wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations than
my own.
 
"I think I shall trade, also," said he, putting his thumbs in his
waistcoat pockets, "to the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum.
Also to Ceylon, specially for elephants tusks."
 
"You will want a good many ships," said I.
 
"A perfect fleet," said he.
 
Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I asked him
where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present?
 
"I havent begun insuring yet," he replied. "I am looking about me."
 
Somehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnards Inn. I said
in a tone of conviction, "Ahh!"
 
"Yes. I am in a countinghouse, and looking about me."
 
"Is a countinghouse profitable?" I asked.
 
"Todo you mean to the young fellow whos in it?" he asked, in reply.
 
"Yes to you."
 
"Why, nno not to me." He said this with the air of one carefully
reckoning up and striking a balance. "Not directly profitable. That is,
it doesnt pay me anything, and I have tokeep myself."
 
This certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my head as
if I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative
capital from such a source of income.
 
"But the thing is," said Herbert Pocket, "that you look about you.
Thats the grand thing. You are in a countinghouse, you know, and you
look about you."
 
It struck me as a singular implication that you couldnt be out of a
countinghouse, you know, and look about you but I silently deferred to
his experience.
 
"Then the time comes," said Herbert, "when you see your opening. And you
go in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and then there
you are! When you have once made your capital, you have nothing to do
but employ it."
 
This was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden
very like. His manner of bearing his poverty, too, exactly corresponded
to his manner of bearing that defeat. It seemed to me that he took all
blows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine
then. It was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest
necessaries, for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have been
sent in on my account from the coffeehouse or somewhere else.
 
Yet, having already made his fortune in his own mind, he was so
unassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being
puffed up. It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways,
and we got on famously. In the evening we went out for a walk in the
streets, and went halfprice to the Theatre and next day we went to
church at Westminster Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked in the
Parks and I wondered who shod all the horses there, and wished Joe did.
 
On a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I had
left Joe and Biddy. The space interposed between myself and them partook
of that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off. That I could
have been at our old church in my old churchgoing clothes, on the very
last Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination of impossibilities,
geographical and social, solar and lunar. Yet in the London streets so
crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening,
there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor
old kitchen at home so far away and in the dead of night, the footsteps
of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about Barnards Inn,
under pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my heart.
 
On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to
the countinghouse to report himself,to look about him, too, I
suppose,and I bore him company. He was to come away in an hour or
two to attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for him. It
appeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched were
incubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging from the
places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday morning. Nor
did the countinghouse where Herbert assisted, show in my eyes as at
all a good Observatory being a back second floor up a yard, of a grimy
presence in all particulars, and with a look into another back second
floor, rather than a look out.
 
I waited about until it was noon, and I went upon Change, and I saw
fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took to
be great merchants, though I couldnt understand why they should all be
out of spirits. When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a celebrated
house which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have been the
most abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not help noticing,
even then, that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives
and waiters clothes, than in the steaks. This collation disposed of at
a moderate price considering the grease, which was not charged for, we
went back to Barnards Inn and got my little portmanteau, and then took
coach for Hammersmith. We arrived there at two or three oclock in
the afternoon, and had very little way to walk to Mr. Pockets house.
Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct into a little garden
overlooking the river, where Mr. Pockets children were playing
about. And unless I deceive myself on a point where my interests or
prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr. and Mrs.
Pockets children were not growing up or being brought up, but were
tumbling up.
 
Mrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with
her legs upon another garden chair and Mrs. Pockets two nursemaids
were looking about them while the children played. "Mamma," said
Herbert, "this is young Mr. Pip." Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me
with an appearance of amiable dignity.
 
"Master Alick and Miss Jane," cried one of the nurses to two of the
children, "if you go a bouncing up against them bushes youll fall over
into the river and be drownded, and whatll your pa say then?"
 
At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pockets handkerchief, and
said, "If that dont make six times youve dropped it, Mum!" Upon which
Mrs. Pocket laughed and said, "Thank you, Flopson," and settling herself
in one chair only, resumed her book. Her countenance immediately assumed
a knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week,
but before she could have read half a dozen lines, she fixed her eyes
upon me, and said, "I hope your mamma is quite well?" This unexpected
inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I began saying in the
absurdest way that if there had been any such person I had no doubt she
would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and
would have sent her compliments, when the nurse came to my rescue.
 
"Well!" she cried, picking up the pockethandkerchief, "if that dont
make seven times! What ARE you a doing of this afternoon, Mum!" Mrs.
Pocket received her property, at first with a look of unutterable
surprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of
recognition, and said, "Thank you, Flopson," and forgot me, and went on
reading.
 
I found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than
six little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had
scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the region
of air, wailing dolefully.
 
"If there aint Baby!" said Flopson, appearing to think it most
surprising. "Make haste up, Millers."
 
Millers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by degrees
the childs wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a young
ventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs. Pocket read all the
time, and I was curious to know what the book could be.
 
We were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us at any
rate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the
remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed
near Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and
tumbled over her,always very much to her momentary astonishment, and
their own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for
this surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to
speculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby,
which baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs.
Pocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby
and all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.
 
"Gracious me, Flopson!" said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for a
moment, "everybodys tumbling!"
 
"Gracious you, indeed, Mum!" returned Flopson, very red in the face
"what have you got there?"
 
"I got here, Flopson?" asked Mrs. Pocket.
 
"Why, if it aint your footstool!" cried Flopson. "And if you keep it
under your skirts like that, whos to help tumbling? Here! Take the
baby, Mum, and give me your book."
 
Mrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a
little in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had
lasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders
that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made the
second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the little
Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.
 
Under these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the children
into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket came out
of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to find that Mr.
Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face, and
with his very gray hair disordered on his head, as if he didnt quite
see his way to putting anything straight.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXIII
 
Mr. Pocket said he was glad to see me, and he hoped I was not sorry to
see him. "For, I really am not," he added, with his sons smile,
"an alarming personage." He was a younglooking man, in spite of
his perplexities and his very gray hair, and his manner seemed quite
natural. I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected
there was something comic in his distraught way, as though it would have
been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very
near being so. When he had talked with me a little, he said to Mrs.
Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows, which were
black and handsome, "Belinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?" And she
looked up from her book, and said, "Yes." She then smiled upon me in an
absent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of orangeflower
water? As the question had no bearing, near or remote, on any foregone
or subsequent transaction, I consider it to have been thrown out, like
her previous approaches, in general conversational condescension.
 
I found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs.
Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased
Knight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased
father would have been made a Baronet but for somebodys determined
opposition arising out of entirely personal motives,I forget whose,
if I ever knew,the Sovereigns, the Prime Ministers, the Lord
Chancellors, the Archbishop of Canterburys, anybodys,and had
tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite
supposititious fact. I believe he had been knighted himself for storming
the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate address
engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of
some building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage either the
trowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had directed Mrs. Pocket to
be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things
must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of
plebeian domestic knowledge.
 
So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady
by this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but
perfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily formed,
in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket who was
also in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to mount
to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his doing the
one or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pocket had
taken Time by the forelock when, to judge from its length, it would
seem to have wanted cutting, and had married without the knowledge of
the judicious parent. The judicious parent, having nothing to bestow or
withhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled that dower upon them
after a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket that his wife was "a
treasure for a Prince." Mr. Pocket had invested the Princes treasure
in the ways of the world ever since, and it was supposed to have brought
him in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs. Pocket was in general the
object of a queer sort of respectful pity, because she had not married
a title while Mr. Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving
reproach, because he had never got one.
 
Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room which was a
pleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for
my own private sittingroom. He then knocked at the doors of two other
similar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle
and Startop. Drummle, an oldlooking young man of a heavy order of
architecture, was whistling. Startop, younger in years and appearance,
was reading and holding his head, as if he thought himself in danger of
exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge.
 
Both Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody
elses hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the house
and let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be the
servants. It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of saving
trouble but it had the appearance of being expensive, for the servants
felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and
drinking, and to keep a deal of company down stairs. They allowed a very
liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it always appeared to me that
by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been
the kitchen,always supposing the boarder capable of selfdefence, for,
before I had been there a week, a neighboring lady with whom the family
were personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that she had seen Millers
slapping the baby. This greatly distressed Mrs. Pocket, who burst into
tears on receiving the note, and said that it was an extraordinary thing
that the neighbors couldnt mind their own business.
 
By degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had been
educated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguished himself
but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket very
early in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling
of a Grinder. After grinding a number of dull blades,of whom it was
remarkable that their fathers, when influential, were always going to
help him to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the blades had
left the Grindstone,he had wearied of that poor work and had come to
London. Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, he had "read"
with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them, and had
refurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turned his
acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction,
and on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, still
maintained the house I saw.
 
Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbor a widow lady of that highly
sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody, blessed everybody,
and shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances. This
ladys name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honor of taking her down to
dinner on the day of my installation. She gave me to understand on the
stairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr. Pocket
should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him.
That did not extend to me, she told me in a gush of love and confidence
at that time, I had known her something less than five minutes if
they were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.
 
"But dear Mrs. Pocket," said Mrs. Coiler, "after her early
disappointment not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that, requires
so much luxury and elegance"
 
"Yes, maam," I said, to stop her, for I was afraid she was going to
cry.
 
"And she is of so aristocratic a disposition"
 
"Yes, maam," I said again, with the same object as before.
 
"That it is hard," said Mrs. Coiler, "to have dear Mr. Pockets time
and attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket."
 
I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butchers time
and attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket but I said nothing,
and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company
manners.
 
It came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and
Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and
other instruments of selfdestruction, that Drummle, whose Christian
name was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy.
It further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the
garden was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at which
her grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come at all.
Drummle didnt say much, but in his limited way he struck me as a sulky
kind of fellow he spoke as one of the elect, and recognized Mrs. Pocket
as a woman and a sister. No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler the toady
neighbor showed any interest in this part of the conversation, and it
appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert but it promised to last
a long time, when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic
affliction. It was, in effect, that the cook had mislaid the beef. To my
unutterable amazement, I now, for the first time, saw Mr. Pocket
relieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very
extraordinary, but which made no impression on anybody else, and
with which I soon became as familiar as the rest. He laid down the
carvingknife and fork,being engaged in carving, at the moment,put
his two hands into his disturbed hair, and appeared to make an
extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it. When he had done this,
and had not lifted himself up at all, he quietly went on with what he
was about.
 
Mrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me. I liked
it for a few moments, but she flattered me so very grossly that the
pleasure was soon over. She had a serpentine way of coming close at
me when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and
localities I had left, which was altogether snaky and forktongued and
when she made an occasional bounce upon Startop who said very little to
her, or upon Drummle who said less, I rather envied them for being on
the opposite side of the table.
 
After dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made admiring
comments on their eyes, noses, and legs,a sagacious way of improving
their minds. There were four little girls, and two little boys, besides
the baby who might have been either, and the babys next successor who
was as yet neither. They were brought in by Flopson and Millers, much as
though those two noncommissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere
for children and had enlisted these, while Mrs. Pocket looked at the
young Nobles that ought to have been as if she rather thought she had
had the pleasure of inspecting them before, but didnt quite know what
to make of them.
 
"Here! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby," said Flopson. "Dont
take it that way, or youll get its head under the table."
 
Thus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head
upon the table which was announced to all present by a prodigious
concussion.
 
"Dear, dear! Give it me back, Mum," said Flopson "and Miss Jane, come
and dance to baby, do!"
 
One of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely
taken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her place
by me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, and
laughed. Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket who in the
meantime had twice endeavored to lift himself up by the hair laughed,
and we all laughed and were glad.
 
Flopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll,
then got it safely into Mrs. Pockets lap, and gave it the nutcrackers
to play with at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice
that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its
eyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same. Then, the
two nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with
a dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearly lost
half his buttons at the gamingtable.
 
I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pockets falling into a
discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate a
sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the
baby on her lap, who did most appalling things with the nutcrackers. At
length little Jane, perceiving its young brains to be imperilled, softly
left her place, and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous
weapon away. Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the same time,
and not approving of this, said to Jane,
 
"You naughty child, how dare you? Go and sit down this instant!"
 
"Mamma dear," lisped the little girl, "baby ood have put hith eyeth
out."
 
"How dare you tell me so?" retorted Mrs. Pocket. "Go and sit down in
your chair this moment!"
 
Mrs. Pockets dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed, as if
I myself had done something to rouse it.
 
"Belinda," remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table,
"how can you be so unreasonable? Jane only interfered for the protection
of baby."
 
"I will not allow anybody to interfere," said Mrs. Pocket. "I am
surprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of
interference."
 
"Good God!" cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation.
"Are infants to be nutcrackered into their tombs, and is nobody to save
them?"
 
"I will not be interfered with by Jane," said Mrs. Pocket, with a
majestic glance at that innocent little offender. "I hope I know my poor
grandpapas position. Jane, indeed!"
 
Mr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again, and this time really did
lift himself some inches out of his chair. "Hear this!" he helplessly
exclaimed to the elements. "Babies are to be nutcrackered dead, for
peoples poor grandpapas positions!" Then he let himself down again,
and became silent.
 
We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on. A
pause succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a
series of leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to be the
only member of the family irrespective of servants with whom it had
any decided acquaintance.
 
"Mr. Drummle," said Mrs. Pocket, "will you ring for Flopson? Jane, you
undutiful little thing, go and lie down. Now, baby darling, come with
ma!"
 
The baby was the soul of honor, and protested with all its might. It
doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pockets arm, exhibited a pair
of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft
face, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny. And it gained
its point after all, for I saw it through the window within a few
minutes, being nursed by little Jane.
 
It happened that the other five children were left behind at the
dinnertable, through Flopsons having some private engagement, and
their not being anybody elses business. I thus became aware of the
mutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified in
the following manner. Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of his face
heightened and his hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes, as if
he couldnt make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that
establishment, and why they hadnt been billeted by Nature on
somebody else. Then, in a distant Missionary way he asked them certain
questions,as why little Joe had that hole in his frill, who said, Pa,
Flopson was going to mend it when she had time,and how little Fanny
came by that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it
when she didnt forget. Then, he melted into parental tenderness, and
gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play and then as
they went out, with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the
hair he dismissed the hopeless subject.
 
In the evening there was rowing on the river. As Drummle and Startop had
each a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out. I was
pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts, but as
I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames,not to say
for other waters,I at once engaged to place myself under the tuition
of the winner of a prizewherry who plied at our stairs, and to whom I
was introduced by my new allies. This practical authority confused me
very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith. If he could have
known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil, I doubt if he would
have paid it.
 
There was a suppertray after we got home at night, and I think we
should all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable
domestic occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid
came in, and said, "If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you."
 
"Speak to your master?" said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was roused
again. "How can you think of such a thing? Go and speak to Flopson. Or
speak to meat some other time."
 
"Begging your pardon, maam," returned the housemaid, "I should wish to
speak at once, and to speak to master."
 
Hereupon, Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best of
ourselves until he came back.
 
"This is a pretty thing, Belinda!" said Mr. Pocket, returning with a
countenance expressive of grief and despair. "Heres the cook lying
insensibly drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of fresh
butter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!"
 
Mrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, "This is
that odious Sophias doing!"
 
"What do you mean, Belinda?" demanded Mr. Pocket.
 
"Sophia has told you," said Mrs. Pocket. "Did I not see her with my own
eyes and hear her with my own ears, come into the room just now and ask
to speak to you?"
 
"But has she not taken me down stairs, Belinda," returned Mr. Pocket,
"and shown me the woman, and the bundle too?"
 
"And do you defend her, Matthew," said Mrs. Pocket, "for making
mischief?"
 
Mr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan.
 
"Am I, grandpapas granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?" said Mrs.
Pocket. "Besides, the cook has always been a very nice respectful woman,
and said in the most natural manner when she came to look after the
situation, that she felt I was born to be a Duchess."
 
There was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood, and he dropped upon it in the
attitude of the Dying Gladiator. Still in that attitude he said, with a
hollow voice, "Good night, Mr. Pip," when I deemed it advisable to go to
bed and leave him.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXIV
 
After two or three days, when I had established myself in my room and
had gone backwards and forwards to London several times, and had ordered
all I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr. Pocket and I had a long talk together.
He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for he referred
to his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed for any
profession, and that I should be well enough educated for my destiny
if I could "hold my own" with the average of young men in prosperous
circumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to the contrary.
 
He advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition of
such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him with the functions
of explainer and director of all my studies. He hoped that with
intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me, and
should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his. Through his way
of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himself on
confidential terms with me in an admirable manner and I may state
at once that he was always so zealous and honorable in fulfilling his
compact with me, that he made me zealous and honorable in fulfilling
mine with him. If he had shown indifference as a master, I have no doubt
I should have returned the compliment as a pupil he gave me no such
excuse, and each of us did the other justice. Nor did I ever regard
him as having anything ludicrous about himor anything but what was
serious, honest, and goodin his tutor communication with me.
 
When these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had
begun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my
bedroom in Barnards Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my
manners would be none the worse for Herberts society. Mr. Pocket did
not object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could
possibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I felt
that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would
save Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and imparted
my wish to Mr. Jaggers.
 
"If I could buy the furniture now hired for me," said I, "and one or two
other little things, I should be quite at home there."
 
"Go it!" said Mr. Jaggers, with a short laugh. "I told you youd get on.
Well! How much do you want?"
 
I said I didnt know how much.
 
"Come!" retorted Mr. Jaggers. "How much? Fifty pounds?"
 
"O, not nearly so much."
 
"Five pounds?" said Mr. Jaggers.
 
This was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, "O, more than
that."
 
"More than that, eh!" retorted Mr. Jaggers, lying in wait for me, with
his hands in his pockets, his head on one side, and his eyes on the wall
behind me "how much more?"
 
"It is so difficult to fix a sum," said I, hesitating.
 
"Come!" said Mr. Jaggers. "Lets get at it. Twice five will that do?
Three times five will that do? Four times five will that do?"
 
I said I thought that would do handsomely.
 
"Four times five will do handsomely, will it?" said Mr. Jaggers,
knitting his brows. "Now, what do you make of four times five?"
 
"What do I make of it?"
 
"Ah!" said Mr. Jaggers "how much?"
 
"I suppose you make it twenty pounds," said I, smiling.
 
"Never mind what I make it, my friend," observed Mr. Jaggers, with a
knowing and contradictory toss of his head. "I want to know what you
make it."
 
"Twenty pounds, of course."
 
"Wemmick!" said Mr. Jaggers, opening his office door. "Take Mr. Pips
written order, and pay him twenty pounds."
 
This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked
impression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind. Mr. Jaggers never
laughed but he wore great bright creaking boots, and, in poising
himself on these boots, with his large head bent down and his eyebrows
joined together, awaiting an answer, he sometimes caused the boots to
creak, as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way. As he happened
to go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative, I said to Wemmick
that I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggerss manner.
 
"Tell him that, and hell take it as a compliment," answered Wemmick
"he dont mean that you should know what to make of it.Oh!" for
I looked surprised, "its not personal its professional only
professional."
 
Wemmick was at his desk, lunchingand crunchingon a dry hard biscuit
pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth, as
if he were posting them.
 
"Always seems to me," said Wemmick, "as if he had set a mantrap and was
watching it. Suddenlyclickyoure caught!"
 
Without remarking that mantraps were not among the amenities of life, I
said I supposed he was very skilful?
 
"Deep," said Wemmick, "as Australia." Pointing with his pen at the
office floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the purposes
of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe.
"If there was anything deeper," added Wemmick, bringing his pen to
paper, "hed be it."
 
Then, I said I supposed he had a fine business, and Wemmick said,
"Capital!" Then I asked if there were many clerks? to which he
replied,
 
"We dont run much into clerks, because theres only one Jaggers, and
people wont have him at second hand. There are only four of us. Would
you like to see em? You are one of us, as I may say."
 
I accepted the offer. When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the
post, and had paid me my money from a cashbox in a safe, the key
of which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his
coatcollar like an ironpigtail, we went up stairs. The house was dark
and shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr.
Jaggerss room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase
for years. In the front first floor, a clerk who looked something
between a publican and a ratcatchera large pale, puffed, swollen
manwas attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby
appearance, whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to
be treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggerss coffers. "Getting evidence
together," said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out, "for the Bailey." In the
room over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair
his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy was
similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presented
to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling, and who would melt
me anything I pleased,and who was in an excessive whiteperspiration,
as if he had been trying his art on himself. In a back room, a
highshouldered man with a faceache tied up in dirty flannel, who was
dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been
waxed, was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of
the other two gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggerss own use.
 
This was all the establishment. When we went down stairs again, Wemmick
led me into my guardians room, and said, "This youve seen already."
 
"Pray," said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them
caught my sight again, "whose likenesses are those?"
 
"These?" said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust off
the horrible heads before bringing them down. "These are two celebrated
ones. Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit. This chap
why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the
inkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal! murdered
his master, and, considering that he wasnt brought up to evidence,
didnt plan it badly."
 
"Is it like him?" I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spat
upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve.
 
"Like him? Its himself, you know. The cast was made in Newgate,
directly after he was taken down. You had a particular fancy for
me, hadnt you, Old Artful?" said Wemmick. He then explained this
affectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing the lady
and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying,
"Had it made for me, express!"
 
"Is the lady anybody?" said I.
 
"No," returned Wemmick. "Only his game. You liked your bit of game,
didnt you? No deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, except
one,and she wasnt of this slender ladylike sort, and you wouldnt
have caught her looking after this urn, unless there was something to
drink in it." Wemmicks attention being thus directed to his brooch, he
put down the cast, and polished the brooch with his pockethandkerchief.
 
"Did that other creature come to the same end?" I asked. "He has the
same look."
 
"Youre right," said Wemmick "its the genuine look. Much as if one
nostril was caught up with a horsehair and a little fishhook. Yes,
he came to the same end quite the natural end here, I assure you.
He forged wills, this blade did, if he didnt also put the supposed
testators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, though" Mr.
Wemmick was again apostrophizing, "and you said you could write Greek.
Yah, Bounceable! What a liar you were! I never met such a liar as you!"
Before putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched the
largest of his mourning rings and said, "Sent out to buy it for me, only
the day before."
 
While he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair,
the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived
from like sources. As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, I
ventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stood before
me, dusting his hands.
 
"O yes," he returned, "these are all gifts of that kind. One brings
another, you see thats the way of it. I always take em. Theyre
curiosities. And theyre property. They may not be worth much, but,
after all, theyre property and portable. It dont signify to you with
your brilliant lookout, but as to myself, my guidingstar always is,
Get hold of portable property."
 
When I had rendered homage to this light, he went on to say, in a
friendly manner
 
"If at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you wouldnt
mind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you a bed, and I
should consider it an honor. I have not much to show you but such two
or three curiosities as I have got you might like to look over and I am
fond of a bit of garden and a summerhouse."
 
I said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality.
 
"Thankee," said he "then well consider that its to come off, when
convenient to you. Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?"
 
"Not yet."
 
"Well," said Wemmick, "hell give you wine, and good wine. Ill give you
punch, and not bad punch. And now Ill tell you something. When you go
to dine with Mr. Jaggers, look at his housekeeper."
 
"Shall I see something very uncommon?"
 
"Well," said Wemmick, "youll see a wild beast tamed. Not so very
uncommon, youll tell me. I reply, that depends on the original wildness
of the beast, and the amount of taming. It wont lower your opinion of
Mr. Jaggerss powers. Keep your eye on it."
 
I told him I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that his
preparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, he asked me if I
would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers "at it?"
 
For several reasons, and not least because I didnt clearly know what
Mr. Jaggers would be found to be "at," I replied in the affirmative.
We dived into the City, and came up in a crowded policecourt, where
a bloodrelation in the murderous sense of the deceased, with the
fanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortably
chewing something while my guardian had a woman under examination or
crossexamination,I dont know which,and was striking her, and
the bench, and everybody present, with awe. If anybody, of whatsoever
degree, said a word that he didnt approve of, he instantly required to
have it "taken down." If anybody wouldnt make an admission, he said,
"Ill have it out of you!" and if anybody made an admission, he said,
"Now I have got you!" The magistrates shivered under a single bite of
his finger. Thieves and thieftakers hung in dread rapture on his words,
and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction. Which
side he was on I couldnt make out, for he seemed to me to be grinding
the whole place in a mill I only know that when I stole out on tiptoe,
he was not on the side of the bench for, he was making the legs of the
old gentleman who presided, quite convulsive under the table, by his
denunciations of his conduct as the representative of British law and
justice in that chair that day.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXV
 
Bentley Drummle, who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book
as if its writer had done him an injury, did not take up an
acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit. Heavy in figure, movement,
and comprehension,in the sluggish complexion of his face, and in
the large, awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as
he himself lolled about in a room,he was idle, proud, niggardly,
reserved, and suspicious. He came of rich people down in Somersetshire,
who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the
discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead. Thus, Bentley Drummle
had come to Mr. Pocket when he was a head taller than that gentleman,
and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen.
 
Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he
ought to have been at school, but he was devotedly attached to her, and
admired her beyond measure. He had a womans delicacy of feature,
and was"as you may see, though you never saw her," said Herbert to
me"exactly like his mother." It was but natural that I should take to
him much more kindly than to Drummle, and that, even in the earliest
evenings of our boating, he and I should pull homeward abreast of one
another, conversing from boat to boat, while Bentley Drummle came up
in our wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes. He
would always creep inshore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature,
even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way and I always
think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the backwater,
when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in
midstream.
 
Herbert was my intimate companion and friend. I presented him with a
halfshare in my boat, which was the occasion of his often coming down
to Hammersmith and my possession of a halfshare in his chambers often
took me up to London. We used to walk between the two places at all
hours. I have an affection for the road yet though it is not so
pleasant a road as it was then, formed in the impressibility of untried
youth and hope.
 
When I had been in Mr. Pockets family a month or two, Mr. and Mrs.
Camilla turned up. Camilla was Mr. Pockets sister. Georgiana, whom I
had seen at Miss Havishams on the same occasion, also turned up. She
was a cousin,an indigestive single woman, who called her rigidity
religion, and her liver love. These people hated me with the hatred of
cupidity and disappointment. As a matter of course, they fawned upon
me in my prosperity with the basest meanness. Towards Mr. Pocket, as
a grownup infant with no notion of his own interests, they showed the
complacent forbearance I had heard them express. Mrs. Pocket they
held in contempt but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily
disappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light upon
themselves.
 
These were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied
myself to my education. I soon contracted expensive habits, and began
to spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should have
thought almost fabulous but through good and evil I stuck to my books.
There was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough to feel
my deficiencies. Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast and, with
one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I wanted, and
clear obstructions out of my road, I must have been as great a dolt as
Drummle if I had done less.
 
I had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write
him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening. He
replied that it would give him much pleasure, and that he would expect
me at the office at six oclock. Thither I went, and there I found him,
putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck.
 
"Did you think of walking down to Walworth?" said he.
 
"Certainly," said I, "if you approve."
 
"Very much," was Wemmicks reply, "for I have had my legs under the desk
all day, and shall be glad to stretch them. Now, Ill tell you what I
have got for supper, Mr. Pip. I have got a stewed steak,which is
of home preparation,and a cold roast fowl,which is from the
cooksshop. I think its tender, because the master of the shop was a
Juryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him down easy.
I reminded him of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, "Pick us out
a good one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the box
another day or two, we could easily have done it." He said to that,
"Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop." I let him, of
course. As far as it goes, its property and portable. You dont object
to an aged parent, I hope?"
 
I really thought he was still speaking of the fowl, until he added,
"Because I have got an aged parent at my place." I then said what
politeness required.
 
"So, you havent dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?" he pursued, as we walked
along.
 
"Not yet."
 
"He told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming. I expect
youll have an invitation tomorrow. Hes going to ask your pals, too.
Three of em aint there?"
 
Although I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my
intimate associates, I answered, "Yes."
 
"Well, hes going to ask the whole gang,"I hardly felt complimented by
the word,"and whatever he gives you, hell give you good. Dont look
forward to variety, but youll have excellence. And theres another rum
thing in his house," proceeded Wemmick, after a moments pause, as if
the remark followed on the housekeeper understood "he never lets a door
or window be fastened at night."
 
"Is he never robbed?"
 
"Thats it!" returned Wemmick. "He says, and gives it out publicly, "I
want to see the man wholl rob me." Lord bless you, I have heard him, a
hundred times, if I have heard him once, say to regular cracksmen in our
front office, "You know where I live now, no bolt is ever drawn there
why dont you do a stroke of business with me? Come cant I tempt you?"
Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on, for love or
money."
 
"They dread him so much?" said I.
 
"Dread him," said Wemmick. "I believe you they dread him. Not but what
hes artful, even in his defiance of them. No silver, sir. Britannia
metal, every spoon."
 
"So they wouldnt have much," I observed, "even if they"
 
"Ah! But he would have much," said Wemmick, cutting me short, "and they
know it. Hed have their lives, and the lives of scores of em. Hed
have all he could get. And its impossible to say what he couldnt get,
if he gave his mind to it."
 
I was falling into meditation on my guardians greatness, when Wemmick
remarked
 
"As to the absence of plate, thats only his natural depth, you know.
A rivers its natural depth, and hes his natural depth. Look at his
watchchain. Thats real enough."
 
"Its very massive," said I.
 
"Massive?" repeated Wemmick. "I think so. And his watch is a gold
repeater, and worth a hundred pound if its worth a penny. Mr. Pip,
there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about
that watch theres not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, who
wouldnt identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it
was red hot, if inveigled into touching it."
 
At first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a more
general nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the road,
until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of
Walworth.
 
It appeared to be a collection of back lanes, ditches, and little
gardens, and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement.
Wemmicks house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of
garden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted
with guns.
 
"My own doing," said Wemmick. "Looks pretty dont it?"
 
I highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw
with the queerest gothic windows by far the greater part of them sham,
and a gothic door almost too small to get in at.
 
"Thats a real flagstaff, you see," said Wemmick, "and on Sundays I
run up a real flag. Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge, I
hoist it upsoand cut off the communication."
 
The bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide
and two deep. But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he
hoisted it up and made it fast smiling as he did so, with a relish and
not merely mechanically.
 
"At nine oclock every night, Greenwich time," said Wemmick, "the gun
fires. There he is, you see! And when you hear him go, I think youll
say hes a Stinger."
 
The piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress,
constructed of latticework. It was protected from the weather by an
ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.
 
"Then, at the back," said Wemmick, "out of sight, so as not to impede
the idea of fortifications,for its a principle with me, if you have
an idea, carry it out and keep it up,I dont know whether thats your
opinion"
 
I said, decidedly.
 
"At the back, theres a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits then,
I knock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers and
youll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise. So, sir," said
Wemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head, "if you
can suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil of a
time in point of provisions."
 
Then, he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which was
approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long
time to get at and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth.
Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bower
was raised. This piece of water with an island in the middle which
might have been the salad for supper was of a circular form, and he had
constructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little mill going
and took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extent that it
made the back of your hand quite wet.
 
"I am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and
my own gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades," said Wemmick, in
acknowledging my compliments. "Well its a good thing, you know. It
brushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases the Aged. You wouldnt
mind being at once introduced to the Aged, would you? It wouldnt put
you out?"
 
I expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the castle. There
we found, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat clean,
cheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.
 
"Well aged parent," said Wemmick, shaking hands with him in a cordial
and jocose way, "how am you?"
 
"All right, John all right!" replied the old man.
 
"Heres Mr. Pip, aged parent," said Wemmick, "and I wish you could hear
his name. Nod away at him, Mr. Pip thats what he likes. Nod away at
him, if you please, like winking!"
 
"This is a fine place of my sons, sir," cried the old man, while I
nodded as hard as I possibly could. "This is a pretty pleasureground,
sir. This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept
together by the Nation, after my sons time, for the peoples
enjoyment."
 
"Youre as proud of it as Punch aint you, Aged?" said Wemmick,
contemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened "theres
a nod for you" giving him a tremendous one "theres another for you"
giving him a still more tremendous one "you like that, dont you? If
youre not tired, Mr. Pipthough I know its tiring to strangerswill
you tip him one more? You cant think how it pleases him."
 
I tipped him several more, and he was in great spirits. We left him
bestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in
the arbor where Wemmick told me, as he smoked a pipe, that it had taken
him a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of
perfection.
 
"Is it your own, Mr. Wemmick?"
 
"O yes," said Wemmick, "I have got hold of it, a bit at a time. Its a
freehold, by George!"
 
"Is it indeed? I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?"
 
"Never seen it," said Wemmick. "Never heard of it. Never seen the Aged.
Never heard of him. No the office is one thing, and private life is
another. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and
when I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If its not
in any way disagreeable to you, youll oblige me by doing the same. I
dont wish it professionally spoken about."
 
Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his
request. The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and
talking, until it was almost nine oclock. "Getting near gunfire," said
Wemmick then, as he laid down his pipe "its the Ageds treat."
 
Proceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker,
with expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great
nightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the
moment was come for him to take the redhot poker from the Aged, and
repair to the battery. He took it, and went out, and presently the
Stinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a
cottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup in
it ring. Upon this, the Agedwho I believe would have been blown out
of his armchair but for holding on by the elbowscried out exultingly,
"Hes fired! I heerd him!" and I nodded at the old gentleman until it is
no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.
 
The interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing
me his collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a felonious
character comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been
committed, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and several
manuscript confessions written under condemnation,upon which Mr.
Wemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, "every one
of em Lies, sir." These were agreeably dispersed among small specimens
of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the
museum, and some tobaccostoppers carved by the Aged. They were all
displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had been first
inducted, and which served, not only as the general sittingroom but
as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan on the hob, and
a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a
roastingjack.
 
There was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Aged in
the day. When she had laid the suppercloth, the bridge was lowered to
give her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night. The supper was
excellent and though the Castle was rather subject to dryrot insomuch
that it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might have been
farther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment. Nor was
there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there being such
a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when I lay down
on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that pole on my
forehead all night.
 
Wemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him
cleaning my boots. After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him from
my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in
a most devoted manner. Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at
halfpast eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees,
Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightened
into a postoffice again. At last, when we got to his place of business
and he pulled out his key from his coatcollar, he looked as unconscious
of his Walworth property as if the Castle and the drawbridge and the
arbor and the lake and the fountain and the Aged, had all been blown
into space together by the last discharge of the Stinger.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXVI
 
It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early
opportunity of comparing my guardians establishment with that of his
cashier and clerk. My guardian was in his room, washing his hands with
his scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth and he
called me to him, and gave me the invitation for myself and friends
which Wemmick had prepared me to receive. "No ceremony," he stipulated,
"and no dinner dress, and say tomorrow." I asked him where we should
come to for I had no idea where he lived, and I believe it was in his
general objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied,
"Come here, and Ill take you home with me." I embrace this opportunity
of remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or
a dentist. He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose, which
smelt of the scented soap like a perfumers shop. It had an unusually
large jacktowel on a roller inside the door, and he would wash his
hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel, whenever he came
in from a police court or dismissed a client from his room. When I and
my friends repaired to him at six oclock next day, he seemed to have
been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual, for we found
him with his head butted into this closet, not only washing his hands,
but laving his face and gargling his throat. And even when he had
done all that, and had gone all round the jacktowel, he took out his
penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat
on.
 
There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into
the street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him but there was
something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled
his presence, that they gave it up for that day. As we walked along
westward, he was recognized ever and again by some face in the crowd of
the streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me but
he never otherwise recognized anybody, or took notice that anybody
recognized him.
 
He conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side of
that street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in want
of painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and opened the
door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and little used.
So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on
the first floor. There were carved garlands on the panelled walls, and
as he stood among them giving us welcome, I know what kind of loops I
thought they looked like.
 
Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms the second was his
dressingroom the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the whole
house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was comfortably
laidno silver in the service, of courseand at the side of his chair
was a capacious dumbwaiter, with a variety of bottles and decanters on
it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed throughout, that he
kept everything under his own hand, and distributed everything himself.
 
There was a bookcase in the room I saw from the backs of the books,
that they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography, trials,
acts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very solid
and good, like his watchchain. It had an official look, however, and
there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a little
table of papers with a shaded lamp so that he seemed to bring the
office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an
evening and fall to work.
 
As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,for he and I had
walked together,he stood on the hearthrug, after ringing the bell,
and took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once to
be principally if not solely interested in Drummle.
 
"Pip," said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to
the window, "I dont know one from the other. Whos the Spider?"
 
"The spider?" said I.
 
"The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow."
 
"Thats Bentley Drummle," I replied "the one with the delicate face is
Startop."
 
Not making the least account of "the one with the delicate face," he
returned, "Bentley Drummle is his name, is it? I like the look of that
fellow."
 
He immediately began to talk to Drummle not at all deterred by his
replying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to screw
discourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there came between
me and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.
 
She was a woman of about forty, I supposed,but I may have thought her
younger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely
pale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot
say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be
parted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious expression
of suddenness and flutter but I know that I had been to see Macbeth at
the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked to me as if
it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had seen rise out
of the Witches caldron.
 
She set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a
finger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats
at the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,
while Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the
housekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice
mutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all
the accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our
host from his dumbwaiter and when they had made the circuit of the
table, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean
plates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just
disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant
than the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish and I always saw
in her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made
a dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other
natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass
behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.
 
Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her
own striking appearance and by Wemmicks preparation, I observed
that whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my
guardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put
before him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and
wanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I
fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and a
purpose of always holding her in suspense.
 
Dinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather
than originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of
our dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing my
tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronize Herbert, and to boast
of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my lips.
It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle the
development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious
way at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.
 
It was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our
conversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied
for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.
Drummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to
our company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that
as to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible agency,
my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this
trifle and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular
it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous
manner.
 
Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table my guardian,
taking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her,
was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and
showing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.
Suddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeepers, like a trap,
as she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he do
this, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.
 
"If you talk of strength," said Mr. Jaggers, "Ill show you a wrist.
Molly, let them see your wrist."
 
Her entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other
hand behind her waist. "Master," she said, in a low voice, with her eyes
attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him. "Dont."
 
"Ill show you a wrist," repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable
determination to show it. "Molly, let them see your wrist."
 
"Master," she again murmured. "Please!"
 
"Molly," said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking
at the opposite side of the room, "let them see both your wrists. Show
them. Come!"
 
He took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. She
brought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side by
side. The last wrist was much disfigured,deeply scarred and scarred
across and across. When she held her hands out she took her eyes from
Mr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us
in succession.
 
"Theres power here," said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews
with his forefinger. "Very few men have the power of wrist that this
woman has. Its remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these
hands. I have had occasion to notice many hands but I never saw
stronger in that respect, mans or womans, than these."
 
While he said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she continued
to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The moment
he ceased, she looked at him again. "Thatll do, Molly," said Mr.
Jaggers, giving her a slight nod "you have been admired, and can
go." She withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers,
putting the decanters on from his dumbwaiter, filled his glass and
passed round the wine.
 
"At halfpast nine, gentlemen," said he, "we must break up. Pray make
the best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr. Drummle, I
drink to you."
 
If his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more,
it perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morose
depreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree,
until he became downright intolerable. Through all his stages, Mr.
Jaggers followed him with the same strange interest. He actually seemed
to serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggerss wine.
 
In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink,
and I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot upon some
boorish sneer of Drummles, to the effect that we were too free with our
money. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that it
came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my
presence but a week or so before.
 
"Well," retorted Drummle "hell be paid."
 
"I dont mean to imply that he wont," said I, "but it might make you
hold your tongue about us and our money, I should think."
 
"You should think!" retorted Drummle. "Oh Lord!"
 
"I dare say," I went on, meaning to be very severe, "that you wouldnt
lend money to any of us if we wanted it."
 
"You are right," said Drummle. "I wouldnt lend one of you a sixpence. I
wouldnt lend anybody a sixpence."
 
"Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say."
 
"You should say," repeated Drummle. "Oh Lord!"
 
This was so very aggravatingthe more especially as I found myself
making no way against his surly obtusenessthat I said, disregarding
Herberts efforts to check me,
 
"Come, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, Ill tell you what
passed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money."
 
"I dont want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,"
growled Drummle. And I think he added in a lower growl, that we might
both go to the devil and shake ourselves.
 
"Ill tell you, however," said I, "whether you want to know or not. We
said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed
to be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it."
 
Drummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his hands
in his pockets and his round shoulders raised plainly signifying that
it was quite true, and that he despised us as asses all.
 
Hereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace than
I had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop,
being a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact
opposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct
personal affront. He now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop
tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made
us all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything, Drummle,
without any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of his pockets,
dropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and would
have flung it at his adversarys head, but for our entertainers
dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that
purpose.
 
"Gentlemen," said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and
hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, "I am exceedingly
sorry to announce that its half past nine."
 
On this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door,
Startop was cheerily calling Drummle "old boy," as if nothing had
happened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would not
even walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way so Herbert and I,
who remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides
Startop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses,
much as he was wont to follow in his boat.
 
As the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there for
a moment, and run up stairs again to say a word to my guardian. I found
him in his dressingroom surrounded by his stock of boots, already hard
at it, washing his hands of us.
 
I told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything
disagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he would not blame
me much.
 
"Pooh!" said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through the
waterdrops "its nothing, Pip. I like that Spider though."
 
He had turned towards me now, and was shaking his head, and blowing, and
towelling himself.
 
"I am glad you like him, sir," said I"but I dont."
 
"No, no," my guardian assented "dont have too much to do with him.
Keep as clear of him as you can. But I like the fellow, Pip he is one
of the true sort. Why, if I was a fortuneteller"
 
Looking out of the towel, he caught my eye.
 
"But I am not a fortuneteller," he said, letting his head drop into a
festoon of towel, and towelling away at his two ears. "You know what I
am, dont you? Good night, Pip."
 
"Good night, sir."
 
In about a month after that, the Spiders time with Mr. Pocket was up
for good, and, to the great relief of all the house but Mrs. Pocket, he
went home to the family hole.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXVII
 
 
"MY DEAR MR PIP
 
"I write this by request of Mr. Gargery, for to let you know that he
is going to London in company with Mr. Wopsle and would be glad if
agreeable to be allowed to see you. He would call at Barnards Hotel
Tuesday morning at nine oclock, when if not agreeable please leave
word. Your poor sister is much the same as when you left. We talk of you
in the kitchen every night, and wonder what you are saying and doing. If
now considered in the light of a liberty, excuse it for the love of
poor old days. No more, dear Mr. Pip, from your ever obliged, and
affectionate servant,
 
"BIDDY."
 
"P.S. He wishes me most particular to write what larks. He says you will
understand. I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him,
even though a gentleman, for you had ever a good heart, and he is a
worthy, worthy man. I have read him all, excepting only the last little
sentence, and he wishes me most particular to write again what larks."
 
I received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore its
appointment was for next day. Let me confess exactly with what feelings
I looked forward to Joes coming.
 
Not with pleasure, though I was bound to him by so many ties no
with considerable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of
incongruity. If I could have kept him away by paying money, I certainly
would have paid money. My greatest reassurance was that he was coming
to Barnards Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall
in Bentley Drummles way. I had little objection to his being seen by
Herbert or his father, for both of whom I had a respect but I had the
sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle, whom I held in
contempt. So, throughout life, our worst weaknesses and meannesses are
usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.
 
I had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite
unnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive those
wrestles with Barnard proved to be. By this time, the rooms were
vastly different from what I had found them, and I enjoyed the honor
of occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighboring
upholsterer. I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started a boy
in boots,top boots,in bondage and slavery to whom I might have been
said to pass my days. For, after I had made the monster out of the
refuse of my washerwomans family, and had clothed him with a blue
coat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots
already mentioned, I had to find him a little to do and a great deal
to eat and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my
existence.
 
This avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday
morning in the hall, it was two feet square, as charged for
floorcloth, and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he
thought Joe would like. While I felt sincerely obliged to him for being
so interested and considerate, I had an odd halfprovoked sense of
suspicion upon me, that if Joe had been coming to see him, he wouldnt
have been quite so brisk about it.
 
However, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe, and
I got up early in the morning, and caused the sittingroom and
breakfasttable to assume their most splendid appearance. Unfortunately
the morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have concealed the fact
that Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some weak
giant of a Sweep.
 
As the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the Avenger
pursuant to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Joe on
the staircase. I knew it was Joe, by his clumsy manner of coming up
stairs,his state boots being always too big for him,and by the time
it took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of
his ascent. When at last he stopped outside our door, I could hear his
finger tracing over the painted letters of my name, and I afterwards
distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole. Finally he gave a
faint single rap, and Peppersuch was the compromising name of the
avenging boyannounced "Mr. Gargery!" I thought he never would have
done wiping his feet, and that I must have gone out to lift him off the
mat, but at last he came in.
 
"Joe, how are you, Joe?"
 
"Pip, how AIR you, Pip?"
 
With his good honest face all glowing and shining, and his hat put
down on the floor between us, he caught both my hands and worked them
straight up and down, as if I had been the lastpatented Pump.
 
"I am glad to see you, Joe. Give me your hat."
 
But Joe, taking it up carefully with both hands, like a birdsnest with
eggs in it, wouldnt hear of parting with that piece of property, and
persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way.
 
"Which you have that growed," said Joe, "and that swelled, and that
gentlefolked" Joe considered a little before he discovered this word
"as to be sure you are a honor to your king and country."
 
"And you, Joe, look wonderfully well."
 
"Thank God," said Joe, "Im ekerval to most. And your sister, shes
no worse than she were. And Biddy, shes ever right and ready. And all
friends is no backerder, if not no forarder. Ceptin Wopsle hes had a
drop."
 
All this time still with both hands taking great care of the
birdsnest, Joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room, and
round and round the flowered pattern of my dressinggown.
 
"Had a drop, Joe?"
 
"Why yes," said Joe, lowering his voice, "hes left the Church and went
into the playacting. Which the playacting have likeways brought him
to London along with me. And his wish were," said Joe, getting the
birdsnest under his left arm for the moment, and groping in it for an
egg with his right "if no offence, as I would and you that."
 
I took what Joe gave me, and found it to be the crumpled playbill of
a small metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in that
very week, of "the celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown,
whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our National Bard
has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles."
 
"Were you at his performance, Joe?" I inquired.
 
"I were," said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity.
 
"Was there a great sensation?"
 
"Why," said Joe, "yes, there certainly were a peck of orangepeel.
Partickler when he see the ghost. Though I put it to yourself, sir,
whether it were calclated to keep a man up to his work with a good
hart, to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the Ghost with
"Amen!" A man may have had a misfortun and been in the Church," said
Joe, lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone, "but
that is no reason why you should put him out at such a time. Which I
meantersay, if the ghost of a mans own father cannot be allowed to
claim his attention, what can, Sir? Still more, when his mourning at
is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers
brings it off, try to keep it on how you may."
 
A ghostseeing effect in Joes own countenance informed me that Herbert
had entered the room. So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out his
hand but Joe backed from it, and held on by the birdsnest.
 
"Your servant, Sir," said Joe, "which I hope as you and Pip"here his
eye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and so
plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the
family, that I frowned it down and confused him more"I meantersay, you
two gentlemen,which I hope as you get your elths in this close spot?
For the present may be a werry good inn, according to London opinions,"
said Joe, confidentially, "and I believe its character do stand i but I
wouldnt keep a pig in it myself,not in the case that I wished him to
fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavor on him."
 
Having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our
dwellingplace, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me
"sir," Joe, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round the
room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat,as if it were
only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a
resting place,and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the
chimneypiece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.
 
"Do you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery?" asked Herbert, who always
presided of a morning.
 
"Thankee, Sir," said Joe, stiff from head to foot, "Ill take whichever
is most agreeable to yourself."
 
"What do you say to coffee?"
 
"Thankee, Sir," returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal,
"since you are so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run contrairy
to your own opinions. But dont you never find it a little eating?"
 
"Say tea then," said Herbert, pouring it out.
 
Here Joes hat tumbled off the mantelpiece, and he started out of his
chair and picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot. As if it
were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again
soon.
 
"When did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?"
 
"Were it yesterday afternoon?" said Joe, after coughing behind his hand,
as if he had had time to catch the whoopingcough since he came. "No
it were not. Yes it were. Yes. It were yesterday afternoon" with an
appearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality.
 
"Have you seen anything of London yet?"
 
"Why, yes, Sir," said Joe, "me and Wopsle went off straight to look at
the Blacking Wareus. But we didnt find that it come up to its likeness
in the red bills at the shop doors which I meantersay," added Joe, in
an explanatory manner, "as it is there drawd too architectooralooral."
 
I really believe Joe would have prolonged this word mightily expressive
to my mind of some architecture that I know into a perfect Chorus, but
for his attention being providentially attracted by his hat, which
was toppling. Indeed, it demanded from him a constant attention, and a
quickness of eye and hand, very like that exacted by wicketkeeping.
He made extraordinary play with it, and showed the greatest skill now,
rushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped now, merely stopping
it midway, beating it up, and humoring it in various parts of the room
and against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall,
before he felt it safe to close with it finally splashing it into the
slopbasin, where I took the liberty of laying hands upon it.
 
As to his shirtcollar, and his coatcollar, they were perplexing to
reflect upon,insoluble mysteries both. Why should a man scrape himself
to that extent, before he could consider himself full dressed? Why
should he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for
his holiday clothes? Then he fell into such unaccountable fits of
meditation, with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth had
his eyes attracted in such strange directions was afflicted with such
remarkable coughs sat so far from the table, and dropped so much
more than he ate, and pretended that he hadnt dropped it that I was
heartily glad when Herbert left us for the City.
 
I had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was
all my fault, and that if I had been easier with Joe, Joe would have
been easier with me. I felt impatient of him and out of temper with him
in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head.
 
"Us two being now alone, sir,"began Joe.
 
"Joe," I interrupted, pettishly, "how can you call me, sir?"
 
Joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like
reproach. Utterly preposterous as his cravat was, and as his collars
were, I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look.
 
"Us two being now alone," resumed Joe, "and me having the intentions and
abilities to stay not many minutes more, I will now concludeleastways
beginto mention what have led to my having had the present honor. For
was it not," said Joe, with his old air of lucid exposition, "that my
only wish were to be useful to you, I should not have had the honor of
breaking wittles in the company and abode of gentlemen."
 
I was so unwilling to see the look again, that I made no remonstrance
against this tone.
 
"Well, sir," pursued Joe, "this is how it were. I were at the Bargemen
tother night, Pip"whenever he subsided into affection, he called me
Pip, and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me sir "when
there come up in his shaycart, Pumblechook. Which that same identical,"
said Joe, going down a new track, "do comb my air the wrong way
sometimes, awful, by giving out up and down town as it were him which
ever had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a playfellow
by yourself."
 
"Nonsense. It was you, Joe."
 
"Which I fully believed it were, Pip," said Joe, slightly tossing
his head, "though it signify little now, sir. Well, Pip this same
identical, which his manners is given to blusterous, come to me at
the Bargemen wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the
workingman, sir, and do not over stimilate, and his word were, Joseph,
Miss Havisham she wish to speak to you."
 
"Miss Havisham, Joe?"
 
"She wish, were Pumblechooks word, to speak to you." Joe sat and
rolled his eyes at the ceiling.
 
"Yes, Joe? Go on, please."
 
"Next day, sir," said Joe, looking at me as if I were a long way off,
"having cleaned myself, I go and I see Miss A."
 
"Miss A., Joe? Miss Havisham?"
 
"Which I say, sir," replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as if
he were making his will, "Miss A., or otherways Havisham. Her expression
air then as follering Mr. Gargery. You air in correspondence with Mr.
Pip? Having had a letter from you, I were able to say I am. When
I married your sister, sir, I said I will and when I answered your
friend, Pip, I said I am. Would you tell him, then, said she, that
which Estella has come home and would be glad to see him."
 
I felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe. I hope one remote cause
of its firing may have been my consciousness that if I had known his
errand, I should have given him more encouragement.
 
"Biddy," pursued Joe, "when I got home and asked her fur to write the
message to you, a little hung back. Biddy says, I know he will be very
glad to have it by word of mouth, it is holiday time, you want to see
him, go! I have now concluded, sir," said Joe, rising from his chair,
"and, Pip, I wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and a
greater height."
 
"But you are not going now, Joe?"
 
"Yes I am," said Joe.
 
"But you are coming back to dinner, Joe?"
 
"No I am not," said Joe.
 
Our eyes met, and all the "Sir" melted out of that manly heart as he gave
me his hand.
 
"Pip, dear old chap, life is made of ever so many partings welded
together, as I may say, and one mans a blacksmith, and ones a
whitesmith, and ones a goldsmith, and ones a coppersmith. Diwisions
among such must come, and must be met as they come. If theres been
any fault at all today, its mine. You and me is not two figures to
be together in London nor yet anywheres else but what is private, and
beknown, and understood among friends. It aint that I am proud, but
that I want to be right, as you shall never see me no more in these
clothes. Im wrong in these clothes. Im wrong out of the forge, the
kitchen, or off th meshes. You wont find half so much fault in me if
you think of me in my forge dress, with my hammer in my hand, or even
my pipe. You wont find half so much fault in me if, supposing as you
should ever wish to see me, you come and put your head in at the forge
window and see Joe the blacksmith, there, at the old anvil, in the old
burnt apron, sticking to the old work. Im awful dull, but I hope Ive
beat out something nigh the rights of this at last. And so GOD bless
you, dear old Pip, old chap, GOD bless you!"
 
I had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity
in him. The fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he
spoke these words than it could come in its way in Heaven. He touched me
gently on the forehead, and went out. As soon as I could recover
myself sufficiently, I hurried out after him and looked for him in the
neighboring streets but he was gone.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXVIII
 
It was clear that I must repair to our town next day, and in the first
flow of my repentance, it was equally clear that I must stay at Joes.
But, when I had secured my boxplace by tomorrows coach, and had been
down to Mr. Pockets and back, I was not by any means convinced on the
last point, and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting
up at the Blue Boar. I should be an inconvenience at Joes I was not
expected, and my bed would not be ready I should be too far from
Miss Havishams, and she was exacting and mightnt like it. All other
swindlers upon earth are nothing to the selfswindlers, and with such
pretences did I cheat myself. Surely a curious thing. That I should
innocently take a bad halfcrown of somebody elses manufacture is
reasonable enough but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin
of my own make as good money! An obliging stranger, under pretence of
compactly folding up my banknotes for securitys sake, abstracts the
notes and gives me nutshells but what is his sleight of hand to mine,
when I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!
 
Having settled that I must go to the Blue Boar, my mind was much
disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger. It was
tempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots
in the archway of the Blue Boars postingyard it was almost solemn to
imagine him casually produced in the tailors shop, and confounding
the disrespectful senses of Trabbs boy. On the other hand, Trabbs boy
might worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things or, reckless
and desperate wretch as I knew he could be, might hoot him in the High
Street. My patroness, too, might hear of him, and not approve. On the
whole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind.
 
It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as winter
had now come round, I should not arrive at my destination until two or
three hours after dark. Our time of starting from the Cross Keys was
two oclock. I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare,
attended by the Avenger,if I may connect that expression with one who
never attended on me if he could possibly help it.
 
At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dockyards
by stagecoach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside
passengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling
their ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised
when Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were two
convicts going down with me. But I had a reason that was an old reason
now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word "convict."
 
"You dont mind them, Handel?" said Herbert.
 
"O no!"
 
"I thought you seemed as if you didnt like them?"
 
"I cant pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you dont
particularly. But I dont mind them."
 
"See! There they are," said Herbert, "coming out of the Tap. What a
degraded and vile sight it is!"
 
They had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler
with them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands.
The two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their
legs,irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I
likewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried
a thickknobbed bludgeon under his arm but he was on terms of good
understanding with them, and stood with them beside him, looking on at
the puttingto of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts were
an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he the
Curator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and appeared
as a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the world,
both convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of
clothes. His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes,
and his attire disguised him absurdly but I knew his halfclosed eye
at one glance. There stood the man whom I had seen on the settle at the
Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had brought me down
with his invisible gun!
 
It was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had
never seen me in his life. He looked across at me, and his eye appraised
my watchchain, and then he incidentally spat and said something to the
other convict, and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink
of their coupling manacle, and looked at something else. The great
numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors their coarse mangy
ungainly outer surface, as if they were lower animals their ironed
legs, apologetically garlanded with pockethandkerchiefs and the way
in which all present looked at them and kept from them made them as
Herbert had said a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle.
 
But this was not the worst of it. It came out that the whole of the back
of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and that
there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front
behind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had taken the
fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion, and said
that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous
company, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and infamous, and
shameful, and I dont know what else. At this time the coach was ready
and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing to get up, and
the prisoners had come over with their keeper,bringing with them that
curious flavor of breadpoultice, baize, ropeyarn, and hearthstone,
which attends the convict presence.
 
"Dont take it so much amiss, sir," pleaded the keeper to the angry
passenger "Ill sit next you myself. Ill put em on the outside of
the row. They wont interfere with you, sir. You neednt know theyre
there."
 
"And dont blame me," growled the convict I had recognized. "I dont
want to go. I am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I am concerned
any ones welcome to my place."
 
"Or mine," said the other, gruffly. "I wouldnt have incommoded none
of you, if Id had my way." Then they both laughed, and began cracking
nuts, and spitting the shells about.As I really think I should have
liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so despised.
 
At length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman,
and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind. So he
got into his place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into the
place next him, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they
could, and the convict I had recognized sat behind me with his breath on
the hair of my head.
 
"Good by, Handel!" Herbert called out as we started. I thought what a
blessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip.
 
It is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convicts
breathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. The
sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and
searching acid, it set my very teeth on edge. He seemed to have more
breathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in
doing it and I was conscious of growing highshouldered on one side, in
my shrinking endeavors to fend him off.
 
The weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It made us
all lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Halfway
House behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent. I dozed
off, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a
couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him,
and how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if I
were going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the
question up again.
 
But I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although
I could recognize nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and
shadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that
blew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against
the wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very first
words I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words of
my own thought, "Two One Pound notes."
 
"How did he get em?" said the convict I had never seen.
 
"How should I know?" returned the other. "He had em stowed away
somehows. Giv him by friends, I expect."
 
"I wish," said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, "that I had
em here."
 
"Two one pound notes, or friends?"
 
"Two one pound notes. Id sell all the friends I ever had for one, and
think it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he says?"
 
"So he says," resumed the convict I had recognized,"it was all
said and done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the
Dockyard,Youre a going to be discharged? Yes, I was. Would I find
out that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two
one pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did."
 
"More fool you," growled the other. "Id have spent em on a Man, in
wittles and drink. He must have been a green one. Mean to say he knowed
nothing of you?"
 
"Not a haporth. Different gangs and different ships. He was tried again
for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer."
 
"And was thatHonor!the only time you worked out, in this part of the
country?"
 
"The only time."
 
"What might have been your opinion of the place?"
 
"A most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work work, swamp,
mist, and mudbank."
 
They both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually
growled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.
 
After overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and
been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling
certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity. Indeed, I was not
only so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and
so differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he could
have known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of our
being together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a
dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in his
hearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight as soon as
we touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing. This device I
executed successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot under my
feet I had but to turn a hinge to get it out I threw it down before
me, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the first
stones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went their way
with the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off to
the river. In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for
them at the slimewashed stairs,again heard the gruff "Give way, you!"
like and order to dogs,again saw the wicked Noahs Ark lying out on
the black water.
 
I could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogether
undefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me. As I walked on to
the hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehension of
a painful or disagreeable recognition, made me tremble. I am confident
that it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the revival for a
few minutes of the terror of childhood.
 
The coffeeroom at the Blue Boar was empty, and I had not only ordered
my dinner there, but had sat down to it, before the waiter knew me. As
soon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory, he asked me
if he should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook?
 
"No," said I, "certainly not."
 
The waiter it was he who had brought up the Great Remonstrance from the
Commercials, on the day when I was bound appeared surprised, and
took the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local
newspaper so directly in my way, that I took it up and read this
paragraph
 
Our readers will learn, not altogether without interest, in reference to
the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this
neighborhood what a theme, by the way, for the magic pen of our as yet
not universally acknowledged townsman TOOBY, the poet of our columns!
that the youths earliest patron, companion, and friend, was a highly
respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed
trade, and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises
are situate within a hundred miles of the High Street. It is not wholly
irrespective of our personal feelings that we record HIM as the Mentor
of our young Telemachus, for it is good to know that our town produced
the founder of the latters fortunes. Does the thoughtcontracted brow
of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose
fortunes? We believe that Quintin Matsys was the BLACKSMITH of Antwerp.
VERB. SAP.
 
I entertain a conviction, based upon large experience, that if in the
days of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole, I should have met
somebody there, wandering Esquimaux or civilized man, who would have
told me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my
fortunes.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXIX
 
Betimes in the morning I was up and out. It was too early yet to go to
Miss Havishams, so I loitered into the country on Miss Havishams
side of town,which was not Joes side I could go there
tomorrow,thinking about my patroness, and painting brilliant pictures
of her plans for me.
 
She had adopted Estella, she had as good as adopted me, and it could not
fail to be her intention to bring us together. She reserved it for me to
restore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark rooms,
set the clocks agoing and the cold hearths ablazing, tear down the
cobwebs, destroy the vermin,in short, do all the shining deeds of the
young Knight of romance, and marry the Princess. I had stopped to
look at the house as I passed and its seared red brick walls, blocked
windows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with
its twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich
attractive mystery, of which I was the hero. Estella was the inspiration
of it, and the heart of it, of course. But, though she had taken such
strong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so set upon
her, though her influence on my boyish life and character had been
allpowerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest her with any
attributes save those she possessed. I mention this in this place, of a
fixed purpose, because it is the clew by which I am to be followed into
my poor labyrinth. According to my experience, the conventional notion
of a lover cannot be always true. The unqualified truth is, that when I
loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her simply because I found
her irresistible. Once for all I knew to my sorrow, often and often,
if not always, that I loved her against reason, against promise, against
peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that
could be. Once for all I loved her none the less because I knew it,
and it had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly
believed her to be human perfection.
 
I so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time. When
I had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand, I turned my back upon the
gate, while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart
moderately quiet. I heard the sidedoor open, and steps come across the
courtyard but I pretended not to hear, even when the gate swung on its
rusty hinges.
 
Being at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned. I started
much more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a man in a sober
gray dress. The last man I should have expected to see in that place of
porter at Miss Havishams door.
 
"Orlick!"
 
"Ah, young master, theres more changes than yours. But come in, come
in. Its opposed to my orders to hold the gate open."
 
I entered and he swung it, and locked it, and took the key out. "Yes!"
said he, facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards
the house. "Here I am!"
 
"How did you come here?"
 
"I come her," he retorted, "on my legs. I had my box brought alongside
me in a barrow."
 
"Are you here for good?"
 
"I aint here for harm, young master, I suppose?"
 
I was not so sure of that. I had leisure to entertain the retort in my
mind, while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement, up my
legs and arms, to my face.
 
"Then you have left the forge?" I said.
 
"Do this look like a forge?" replied Orlick, sending his glance all
round him with an air of injury. "Now, do it look like it?"
 
I asked him how long he had left Gargerys forge?
 
"One day is so like another here," he replied, "that I dont know
without casting it up. However, I come here some time since you left."
 
"I could have told you that, Orlick."
 
"Ah!" said he, dryly. "But then youve got to be a scholar."
 
By this time we had come to the house, where I found his room to be one
just within the sidedoor, with a little window in it looking on the
courtyard. In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of place
usually assigned to a gateporter in Paris. Certain keys were hanging on
the wall, to which he now added the gate key and his patchworkcovered
bed was in a little inner division or recess. The whole had a slovenly,
confined, and sleepy look, like a cage for a human dormouse while he,
looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window, looked
like the human dormouse for whom it was fitted up,as indeed he was.
 
"I never saw this room before," I remarked "but there used to be no
Porter here."
 
"No," said he "not till it got about that there was no protection on
the premises, and it come to be considered dangerous, with convicts and
Tag and Rag and Bobtail going up and down. And then I was recommended to
the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought, and
I took it. Its easier than bellowsing and hammering.Thats loaded,
that is."
 
My eye had been caught by a gun with a brassbound stock over the
chimneypiece, and his eye had followed mine.
 
"Well," said I, not desirous of more conversation, "shall I go up to
Miss Havisham?"
 
"Burn me, if I know!" he retorted, first stretching himself and then
shaking himself "my orders ends here, young master. I give this here
bell a rap with this here hammer, and you go on along the passage till
you meet somebody."
 
"I am expected, I believe?"
 
"Burn me twice over, if I can say!" said he.
 
Upon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden in
my thick boots, and he made his bell sound. At the end of the passage,
while the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket, who
appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason
of me.
 
"Oh!" said she. "You, is it, Mr. Pip?"
 
"It is, Miss Pocket. I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and family
are all well."
 
"Are they any wiser?" said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head "they
had better be wiser, than well. Ah, Matthew, Matthew! You know your way,
sir?"
 
Tolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time. I
ascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my old
way at the door of Miss Havishams room. "Pips rap," I heard her say,
immediately "come in, Pip."
 
She was in her chair near the old table, in the old dress, with her two
hands crossed on her stick, her chin resting on them, and her eyes on
the fire. Sitting near her, with the white shoe, that had never been
worn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was an elegant
lady whom I had never seen.
 
"Come in, Pip," Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without looking round
or up "come in, Pip, how do you do, Pip? so you kiss my hand as if I
were a queen, eh?Well?"
 
She looked up at me suddenly, only moving her eyes, and repeated in a
grimly playful manner,
 
"Well?"
 
"I heard, Miss Havisham," said I, rather at a loss, "that you were so
kind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly."
 
"Well?"
 
The lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her eyes and looked
archly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estellas eyes. But she
was so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly,
in all things winning admiration, had made such wonderful advance,
that I seemed to have made none. I fancied, as I looked at her, that
I slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again. O
the sense of distance and disparity that came upon me, and the
inaccessibility that came about her!
 
She gave me her hand. I stammered something about the pleasure I felt in
seeing her again, and about my having looked forward to it, for a long,
long time.
 
"Do you find her much changed, Pip?" asked Miss Havisham, with her
greedy look, and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between
them, as a sign to me to sit down there.
 
"When I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estella
in the face or figure but now it all settles down so curiously into the
old"
 
"What? You are not going to say into the old Estella?" Miss Havisham
interrupted. "She was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go away
from her. Dont you remember?"
 
I said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no better
then, and the like. Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said she
had no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her having been very
disagreeable.
 
"Is he changed?" Miss Havisham asked her.
 
"Very much," said Estella, looking at me.
 
"Less coarse and common?" said Miss Havisham, playing with Estellas
hair.
 
Estella laughed, and looked at the shoe in her hand, and laughed again,
and looked at me, and put the shoe down. She treated me as a boy still,
but she lured me on.
 
We sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had
so wrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just come home from
France, and that she was going to London. Proud and wilful as of old,
she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that
it was impossible and out of natureor I thought soto separate them
from her beauty. Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence
from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had
disturbed my boyhood,from all those illregulated aspirations that had
first made me ashamed of home and Joe,from all those visions that had
raised her face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the
anvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden
window of the forge, and flit away. In a word, it was impossible for me
to separate her, in the past or in the present, from the innermost life
of my life.
 
It was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and
return to the hotel at night, and to London tomorrow. When we had
conversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the
neglected garden on our coming in by and by, she said, I should wheel
her about a little, as in times of yore.
 
So, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I
had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert
I, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress she,
quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine. As we
drew near to the place of encounter, she stopped and said,
 
"I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight
that day but I did, and I enjoyed it very much."
 
"You rewarded me very much."
 
"Did I?" she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. "I remember I
entertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill
that he should be brought here to pester me with his company."
 
"He and I are great friends now."
 
"Are you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?"
 
"Yes."
 
I made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish
look, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy.
 
"Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your
companions," said Estella.
 
"Naturally," said I.
 
"And necessarily," she added, in a haughty tone "what was fit company
for you once, would be quite unfit company for you now."
 
In my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering
intention left of going to see Joe but if I had, this observation put
it to flight.
 
"You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?" said
Estella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the fighting
times.
 
"Not the least."
 
The air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my
side, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at
hers, made a contrast that I strongly felt. It would have rankled in me
more than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being
so set apart for her and assigned to her.
 
The garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and
after we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again
into the brewery yard. I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her
walking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold and
careless look in that direction, "Did I?" I reminded her where she had
come out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said, "I
dont remember." "Not remember that you made me cry?" said I. "No," said
she, and shook her head and looked about her. I verily believe that
her not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry again,
inwardly,and that is the sharpest crying of all.
 
"You must know," said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and
beautiful woman might, "that I have no heart,if that has anything to
do with my memory."
 
I got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of
doubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beauty
without it.
 
"Oh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt," said
Estella, "and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease
to be. But you know what I mean. I have no softness there,
nosympathysentimentnonsense."
 
What was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and
looked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham? No.
In some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance
to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been acquired by
children, from grown person with whom they have been much associated and
secluded, and which, when childhood is passed, will produce a remarkable
occasional likeness of expression between faces that are otherwise quite
different. And yet I could not trace this to Miss Havisham. I looked
again, and though she was still looking at me, the suggestion was gone.
 
What was it?
 
"I am serious," said Estella, not so much with a frown for her brow was
smooth as with a darkening of her face "if we are to be thrown much
together, you had better believe it at once. No!" imperiously stopping
me as I opened my lips. "I have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere. I
have never had any such thing."
 
In another moment we were in the brewery, so long disused, and she
pointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same
first day, and told me she remembered to have been up there, and to have
seen me standing scared below. As my eyes followed her white hand, again
the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed me. My
involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm. Instantly
the ghost passed once more and was gone.
 
What was it?
 
"What is the matter?" asked Estella. "Are you scared again?"
 
"I should be, if I believed what you said just now," I replied, to turn
it off.
 
"Then you dont? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Miss Havisham will
soon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be
laid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one more round
of the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for my
cruelty today you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder."
 
Her handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. She held it in one hand
now, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked. We
walked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in
bloom for me. If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of
the old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it could
not have been more cherished in my remembrance.
 
There was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me
we were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more
in her case than in mine but the air of inaccessibility which her
beauty and her manner gave her, tormented me in the midst of my delight,
and at the height of the assurance I felt that our patroness had chosen
us for one another. Wretched boy!
 
At last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise,
that my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, and
would come back to dinner. The old wintry branches of chandeliers in
the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we
were out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me.
 
It was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we began
the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast. But,
in the funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the
chair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright and beautiful
than before, and I was under stronger enchantment.
 
The time so melted away, that our early dinnerhour drew close at hand,
and Estella left us to prepare herself. We had stopped near the centre
of the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered arms
stretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow
cloth. As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the
door, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensity
that was of its kind quite dreadful.
 
Then, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, and
said in a whisper,
 
"Is she beautiful, graceful, wellgrown? Do you admire her?"
 
"Everybody must who sees her, Miss Havisham."
 
She drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers as
she sat in the chair. "Love her, love her, love her! How does she use
you?"
 
Before I could answer if I could have answered so difficult a question
at all she repeated, "Love her, love her, love her! If she favors
you, love her. If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your heart to
pieces,and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper,love
her, love her, love her!"
 
Never had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her
utterance of these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin arm round
my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her.
 
"Hear me, Pip! I adopted her, to be loved. I bred her and educated her,
to be loved. I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved.
Love her!"
 
She said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that she
meant to say it but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of
lovedespairrevengedire deathit could not have sounded from her
lips more like a curse.
 
"Ill tell you," said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper, "what
real love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning selfhumiliation,
utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the
whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiteras I
did!"
 
When she came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught
her round the waist. For she rose up in the chair, in her shroud of a
dress, and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck herself
against the wall and fallen dead.
 
All this passed in a few seconds. As I drew her down into her chair, I
was conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in
the room.
 
He always carried I have not yet mentioned it, I think a
pockethandkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was
of great value to him in his profession. I have seen him so terrify a
client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pockethandkerchief
as if he were immediately going to blow his nose, and then pausing,
as if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client
or witness committed himself, that the selfcommittal has followed
directly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw him in the room he had
this expressive pockethandkerchief in both hands, and was looking at
us. On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent pause
in that attitude, "Indeed? Singular!" and then put the handkerchief to
its right use with wonderful effect.
 
Miss Havisham had seen him as soon as I, and was like everybody
else afraid of him. She made a strong attempt to compose herself, and
stammered that he was as punctual as ever.
 
"As punctual as ever," he repeated, coming up to us. "How do you do,
Pip? Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round? And so you are
here, Pip?"
 
I told him when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me to
come and see Estella. To which he replied, "Ah! Very fine young lady!"
Then he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of his
large hands, and put the other in his trouserspocket as if the pocket
were full of secrets.
 
"Well, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?" said he, when
he came to a stop.
 
"How often?"
 
"Ah! How many times? Ten thousand times?"
 
"Oh! Certainly not so many."
 
"Twice?"
 
"Jaggers," interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief, "leave my Pip
alone, and go with him to your dinner."
 
He complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together. While
we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved
yard at the back, he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat
and drink offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred
times and once.
 
I considered, and said, "Never."
 
"And never will, Pip," he retorted, with a frowning smile. "She has
never allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she lived this
present life of hers. She wanders about in the night, and then lays
hands on such food as she takes."
 
"Pray, sir," said I, "may I ask you a question?"
 
"You may," said he, "and I may decline to answer it. Put your question."
 
"Estellas name. Is it Havisham or?" I had nothing to add.
 
"Or what?" said he.
 
"Is it Havisham?"
 
"It is Havisham."
 
This brought us to the dinnertable, where she and Sarah Pocket awaited
us. Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced my
green and yellow friend. We dined very well, and were waited on by a
maidservant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but
who, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole
time. After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my
guardian he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage, and the
two ladies left us.
 
Anything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under that
roof I never saw elsewhere, even in him. He kept his very looks to
himself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estellas face once during
dinner. When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered,
but never looked at her, that I could see. On the other hand, she often
looked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his
face never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took
a dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often
referring in conversation with me to my expectations but here,
again, he showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he
extortedand even did extort, though I dont know howthose references
out of my innocent self.
 
And when he and I were left alone together, he sat with an air upon him
of general lying by in consequence of information he possessed, that
really was too much for me. He crossexamined his very wine when he had
nothing else in hand. He held it between himself and the candle, tasted
the port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his
glass again, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and
crossexamined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had known
the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage. Three or four
times I feebly thought I would start conversation but whenever he saw
me going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in his
hand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me to
take notice that it was of no use, for he couldnt answer.
 
I think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her
in the danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off her
cap,which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,and
strewing the ground with her hair,which assuredly had never grown
on her head. She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss
Havishams room, and we four played at whist. In the interval, Miss
Havisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels
from her dressingtable into Estellas hair, and about her bosom and
arms and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick
eyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him,
with those rich flushes of glitter and color in it.
 
Of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody, and
came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the
glory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing nor, of
the feeling that I had, respecting his looking upon us personally in the
light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long
ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his cold
presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that I knew I could
never bear to speak to him about her, that I knew I could never bear to
hear him creak his boots at her, that I knew I could never bear to see
him wash his hands of her it was, that my admiration should be within
a foot or two of him,it was, that my feelings should be in the same
place with him,that, was the agonizing circumstance.
 
We played until nine oclock, and then it was arranged that when Estella
came to London I should be forewarned of her coming and should meet her
at the coach and then I took leave of her, and touched her and left
her.
 
My guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine. Far into the
night, Miss Havishams words, "Love her, love her, love her!" sounded in
my ears. I adapted them for my own repetition, and said to my pillow, "I
love her, I love her, I love her!" hundreds of times. Then, a burst of
gratitude came upon me, that she should be destined for me, once the
blacksmiths boy. Then I thought if she were, as I feared, by no means
rapturously grateful for that destiny yet, when would she begin to be
interested in me? When should I awaken the heart within her that was
mute and sleeping now?
 
Ah me! I thought those were high and great emotions. But I never thought
there was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe, because
I knew she would be contemptuous of him. It was but a day gone, and Joe
had brought the tears into my eyes they had soon dried, God forgive me!
soon dried.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXX
 
After well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boar
in the morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlicks
being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havishams.
"Why of course he is not the right sort of man, Pip," said my guardian,
comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head, "because the man
who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man." It seemed
quite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was
not exceptionally held by the right sort of man, and he listened in a
satisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick. "Very
good, Pip," he observed, when I had concluded, "Ill go round presently,
and pay our friend off." Rather alarmed by this summary action, I was
for a little delay, and even hinted that our friend himself might be
difficult to deal with. "Oh no he wont," said my guardian, making his
pockethandkerchiefpoint, with perfect confidence "I should like to
see him argue the question with me."
 
As we were going back together to London by the midday coach, and as I
breakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely hold
my cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a walk, and
that I would go on along the London road while Mr. Jaggers was occupied,
if he would let the coachman know that I would get into my place when
overtaken. I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar immediately
after breakfast. By then making a loop of about a couple of miles into
the open country at the back of Pumblechooks premises, I got round into
the High Street again, a little beyond that pitfall, and felt myself in
comparative security.
 
It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it was not
disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after.
One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went
a little way down the street before me, that they might turn, as if they
had forgotten something, and pass me face to face,on which occasions I
dont know whether they or I made the worse pretence they of not doing
it, or I of not seeing it. Still my position was a distinguished one,
and I was not at all dissatisfied with it, until Fate threw me in the
way of that unlimited miscreant, Trabbs boy.
 
Casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress, I
beheld Trabbs boy approaching, lashing himself with an empty blue bag.
Deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best
beseem me, and would be most likely to quell his evil mind, I advanced
with that expression of countenance, and was rather congratulating
myself on my success, when suddenly the knees of Trabbs boy smote
together, his hair uprose, his cap fell off, he trembled violently in
every limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to the populace,
"Hold me! Im so frightened!" feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and
contrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance. As I passed him,
his teeth loudly chattered in his head, and with every mark of extreme
humiliation, he prostrated himself in the dust.
 
This was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing. I had not advanced
another two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement,
and indignation, I again beheld Trabbs boy approaching. He was coming
round a narrow corner. His blue bag was slung over his shoulder, honest
industry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabbs with
cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait. With a shock he became
aware of me, and was severely visited as before but this time his
motion was rotatory, and he staggered round and round me with knees
more afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy. His
sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators,
and I felt utterly confounded.
 
I had not got as much further down the street as the postoffice, when I
again beheld Trabbs boy shooting round by a back way. This time, he was
entirely changed. He wore the blue bag in the manner of my greatcoat,
and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of
the street, attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he
from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his hand, "Dont know yah!"
Words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon
me by Trabbs boy, when passing abreast of me, he pulled up his
shirtcollar, twined his sidehair, stuck an arm akimbo, and smirked
extravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body, and drawling to his
attendants, "Dont know yah, dont know yah, pon my soul dont know
yah!" The disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking
to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows, as from an
exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith,
culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and was, so to
speak, ejected by it into the open country.
 
But unless I had taken the life of Trabbs boy on that occasion, I
really do not even now see what I could have done save endure. To
have struggled with him in the street, or to have exacted any lower
recompense from him than his hearts best blood, would have been
futile and degrading. Moreover, he was a boy whom no man could hurt an
invulnerable and dodging serpent who, when chased into a corner, flew
out again between his captors legs, scornfully yelping. I wrote,
however, to Mr. Trabb by next days post, to say that Mr. Pip must
decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed to
the best interests of society, as to employ a boy who excited Loathing
in every respectable mind.
 
The coach, with Mr. Jaggers inside, came up in due time, and I took my
boxseat again, and arrived in London safe,but not sound, for my heart
was gone. As soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential codfish and barrel
of oysters to Joe as reparation for not having gone myself, and then
went on to Barnards Inn.
 
I found Herbert dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome me back.
Having despatched The Avenger to the coffeehouse for an addition to the
dinner, I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my friend
and chum. As confidence was out of the question with The Avenger in the
hall, which could merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to
the keyhole, I sent him to the Play. A better proof of the severity
of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded, than
the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to find him
employment. So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent him to Hyde Park
corner to see what oclock it was.
 
Dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said to
Herbert, "My dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tell
you."
 
"My dear Handel," he returned, "I shall esteem and respect your
confidence."
 
"It concerns myself, Herbert," said I, "and one other person."
 
Herbert crossed his feet, looked at the fire with his head on one side,
and having looked at it in vain for some time, looked at me because I
didnt go on.
 
"Herbert," said I, laying my hand upon his knee, "I loveI
adoreEstella."
 
Instead of being transfixed, Herbert replied in an easy matterofcourse
way, "Exactly. Well?"
 
"Well, Herbert? Is that all you say? Well?"
 
"What next, I mean?" said Herbert. "Of course I know that."
 
"How do you know it?" said I.
 
"How do I know it, Handel? Why, from you."
 
"I never told you."
 
"Told me! You have never told me when you have got your hair cut, but I
have had senses to perceive it. You have always adored her, ever since
I have known you. You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here
together. Told me! Why, you have always told me all day long. When you
told me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring her
the first time you saw her, when you were very young indeed."
 
"Very well, then," said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcome
light, "I have never left off adoring her. And she has come back, a most
beautiful and most elegant creature. And I saw her yesterday. And if I
adored her before, I now doubly adore her."
 
"Lucky for you then, Handel," said Herbert, "that you are picked out for
her and allotted to her. Without encroaching on forbidden ground, we
may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of
that fact. Have you any idea yet, of Estellas views on the adoration
question?"
 
I shook my head gloomily. "Oh! She is thousands of miles away, from me,"
said I.
 
"Patience, my dear Handel time enough, time enough. But you have
something more to say?"
 
"I am ashamed to say it," I returned, "and yet its no worse to say it
than to think it. You call me a lucky fellow. Of course, I am. I was a
blacksmiths boy but yesterday I amwhat shall I say I amtoday?"
 
"Say a good fellow, if you want a phrase," returned Herbert, smiling,
and clapping his hand on the back of mine"a good fellow, with
impetuosity and hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action and
dreaming, curiously mixed in him."
 
I stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture
in my character. On the whole, I by no means recognized the analysis,
but thought it not worth disputing.
 
"When I ask what I am to call myself today, Herbert," I went on, "I
suggest what I have in my thoughts. You say I am lucky. I know I have
done nothing to raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has raised
me that is being very lucky. And yet, when I think of Estella"
 
"And when dont you, you know?" Herbert threw in, with his eyes on the
fire which I thought kind and sympathetic of him.
 
"Then, my dear Herbert, I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain
I feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances. Avoiding forbidden
ground, as you did just now, I may still say that on the constancy of
one person naming no person all my expectations depend. And at the
best, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely what
they are!" In saying this, I relieved my mind of what had always been
there, more or less, though no doubt most since yesterday.
 
"Now, Handel," Herbert replied, in his gay, hopeful way, "it seems to me
that in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking into our
gifthorses mouth with a magnifyingglass. Likewise, it seems to me
that, concentrating our attention on the examination, we altogether
overlook one of the best points of the animal. Didnt you tell me that
your guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you were
not endowed with expectations only? And even if he had not told you
so,though that is a very large If, I grant,could you believe that of
all men in London, Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold his present relations
towards you unless he were sure of his ground?"
 
I said I could not deny that this was a strong point. I said it people
often do so, in such cases like a rather reluctant concession to truth
and justiceas if I wanted to deny it!
 
"I should think it was a strong point," said Herbert, "and I should
think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger as to the rest, you
must bide your guardians time, and he must bide his clients time.
Youll be oneandtwenty before you know where you are, and then perhaps
youll get some further enlightenment. At all events, youll be nearer
getting it, for it must come at last."
 
"What a hopeful disposition you have!" said I, gratefully admiring his
cheery ways.
 
"I ought to have," said Herbert, "for I have not much else. I must
acknowledge, by the by, that the good sense of what I have just said is
not my own, but my fathers. The only remark I ever heard him make on
your story, was the final one, "The thing is settled and done, or Mr.
Jaggers would not be in it." And now before I say anything more about my
father, or my fathers son, and repay confidence with confidence, I want
to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a moment,positively
repulsive."
 
"You wont succeed," said I.
 
"O yes I shall!" said he. "One, two, three, and now I am in for it.
Handel, my good fellow"though he spoke in this light tone, he was
very much in earnest,"I have been thinking since we have been talking
with our feet on this fender, that Estella surely cannot be a condition
of your inheritance, if she was never referred to by your guardian. Am
I right in so understanding what you have told me, as that he never
referred to her, directly or indirectly, in any way? Never even hinted,
for instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage
ultimately?"
 
"Never."
 
"Now, Handel, I am quite free from the flavor of sour grapes, upon my
soul and honor! Not being bound to her, can you not detach yourself from
her?I told you I should be disagreeable."
 
I turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the old marsh
winds coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which had subdued
me on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists were solemnly
rising, and when I laid my hand upon the village fingerpost, smote upon
my heart again. There was silence between us for a little while.
 
"Yes but my dear Handel," Herbert went on, as if we had been talking,
instead of silent, "its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of
a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it very
serious. Think of her bringingup, and think of Miss Havisham. Think of
what she is herself now I am repulsive and you abominate me. This may
lead to miserable things."
 
"I know it, Herbert," said I, with my head still turned away, "but I
cant help it."
 
"You cant detach yourself?"
 
"No. Impossible!"
 
"You cant try, Handel?"
 
"No. Impossible!"
 
"Well!" said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he had
been asleep, and stirring the fire, "now Ill endeavor to make myself
agreeable again!"
 
So he went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs
in their places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about,
looked into the hall, peeped into the letterbox, shut the door, and
came back to his chair by the fire where he sat down, nursing his left
leg in both arms.
 
"I was going to say a word or two, Handel, concerning my father and my
fathers son. I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my fathers son
to remark that my fathers establishment is not particularly brilliant
in its housekeeping."
 
"There is always plenty, Herbert," said I, to say something encouraging.
 
"O yes! and so the dustman says, I believe, with the strongest approval,
and so does the marinestore shop in the back street. Gravely, Handel,
for the subject is grave enough, you know how it is as well as I do. I
suppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up
but if ever there was, the time is gone. May I ask you if you have ever
had an opportunity of remarking, down in your part of the country,
that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are always most
particularly anxious to be married?"
 
This was such a singular question, that I asked him in return, "Is it
so?"
 
"I dont know," said Herbert, "thats what I want to know. Because it
is decidedly the case with us. My poor sister Charlotte, who was next me
and died before she was fourteen, was a striking example. Little Jane
is the same. In her desire to be matrimonially established, you
might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual
contemplation of domestic bliss. Little Alick in a frock has already
made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew. And
indeed, I think we are all engaged, except the baby."
 
"Then you are?" said I.
 
"I am," said Herbert "but its a secret."
 
I assured him of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favored with
further particulars. He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my
weakness that I wanted to know something about his strength.
 
"May I ask the name?" I said.
 
"Name of Clara," said Herbert.
 
"Live in London?"
 
"Yes, perhaps I ought to mention," said Herbert, who had become
curiously crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interesting
theme, "that she is rather below my mothers nonsensical family notions.
Her father had to do with the victualling of passengerships. I think he
was a species of purser."
 
"What is he now?" said I.
 
"Hes an invalid now," replied Herbert.
 
"Living on?"
 
"On the first floor," said Herbert. Which was not at all what I meant,
for I had intended my question to apply to his means. "I have never seen
him, for he has always kept his room overhead, since I have known Clara.
But I have heard him constantly. He makes tremendous rows,roars, and
pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument." In looking at me and
then laughing heartily, Herbert for the time recovered his usual lively
manner.
 
"Dont you expect to see him?" said I.
 
"O yes, I constantly expect to see him," returned Herbert, "because
I never hear him, without expecting him to come tumbling through the
ceiling. But I dont know how long the rafters may hold."
 
When he had once more laughed heartily, he became meek again, and told
me that the moment he began to realize Capital, it was his intention
to marry this young lady. He added as a selfevident proposition,
engendering low spirits, "But you cant marry, you know, while youre
looking about you."
 
As we contemplated the fire, and as I thought what a difficult vision to
realize this same Capital sometimes was, I put my hands in my pockets.
A folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention, I opened
it and found it to be the playbill I had received from Joe, relative
to the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian renown. "And bless my
heart," I involuntarily added aloud, "its tonight!"
 
This changed the subject in an instant, and made us hurriedly resolve
to go to the play. So, when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet
Herbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable
means, and when Herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me
by reputation and that I should be presented to her, and when we had
warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence, we blew out our candles,
made up our fire, locked our door, and issued forth in quest of Mr.
Wopsle and Denmark.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXXI
 
On our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country
elevated in two armchairs on a kitchentable, holding a Court. The
whole of the Danish nobility were in attendance consisting of a noble
boy in the washleather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer
with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life,
and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white
silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. My gifted
townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could have wished
that his curls and forehead had been more probable.
 
Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded.
The late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled
with a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it with him
to the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom also carried
a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had the appearance
of occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of anxiety and a
tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state
of mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led to the Shades being
advised by the gallery to "turn over!"a recommendation which it took
extremely ill. It was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit, that
whereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time
and walked an immense distance, it perceptibly came from a closely
contiguous wall. This occasioned its terrors to be received derisively.
The Queen of Denmark, a very buxom lady, though no doubt historically
brazen, was considered by the public to have too much brass about her
her chin being attached to her diadem by a broad band of that metal as
if she had a gorgeous toothache, her waist being encircled by another,
and each of her arms by another, so that she was openly mentioned
as "the kettledrum." The noble boy in the ancestral boots was
inconsistent, representing himself, as it were in one breath, as an able
seaman, a strolling actor, a gravedigger, a clergyman, and a person
of the utmost importance at a Court fencingmatch, on the authority
of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were
judged. This gradually led to a want of toleration for him, and evenon
his being detected in holy orders, and declining to perform the funeral
serviceto the general indignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly,
Ophelia was a prey to such slow musical madness, that when, in course of
time, she had taken off her white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried
it, a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an
iron bar in the front row of the gallery, growled, "Now the babys put
to bed lets have supper!" Which, to say the least of it, was out of
keeping.
 
Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with
playful effect. Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or
state a doubt, the public helped him out with it. As for example on the
question whether twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared yes,
and some no, and some inclining to both opinions said "Toss up for
it" and quite a Debating Society arose. When he asked what should such
fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven, he was encouraged
with loud cries of "Hear, hear!" When he appeared with his stocking
disordered its disorder expressed, according to usage, by one very neat
fold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flat iron,
a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of his
leg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him.
On his taking the recorders,very like a little black flute that had
just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the door,he was
called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia. When he recommended the
player not to saw the air thus, the sulky man said, "And dont you do
it, neither youre a deal worse than him!" And I grieve to add that
peals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of these occasions.
 
But his greatest trials were in the churchyard, which had the appearance
of a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical washhouse
on one side, and a turnpike gate on the other. Mr. Wopsle in a
comprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at the turnpike,
the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, "Look out! Heres the
undertaker a coming, to see how youre a getting on with your work!"
I believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle
could not possibly have returned the skull, after moralizing over it,
without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast
but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the
comment, "Waiter!" The arrival of the body for interment in an empty
black box with the lid tumbling open, was the signal for a general
joy, which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the bearers, of
an individual obnoxious to identification. The joy attended Mr. Wopsle
through his struggle with Laertes on the brink of the orchestra and
the grave, and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the
kitchentable, and had died by inches from the ankles upward.
 
We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle
but they were too hopeless to be persisted in. Therefore we had sat,
feeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear. I
laughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll
and yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly
fine in Mr. Wopsles elocution,not for old associations sake, I am
afraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very uphill and
downhill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural
circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything.
When the tragedy was over, and he had been called for and hooted, I said
to Herbert, "Let us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet him."
 
We made all the haste we could down stairs, but we were not quick enough
either. Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy
smear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when we
came up with him,
 
"Mr. Pip and friend?"
 
Identity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed.
 
"Mr. Waldengarver," said the man, "would be glad to have the honor."
 
"Waldengarver?" I repeatedwhen Herbert murmured in my ear, "Probably
Wopsle."
 
"Oh!" said I. "Yes. Shall we follow you?"
 
"A few steps, please." When we were in a side alley, he turned and
asked, "How did you think he looked?I dressed him."
 
I dont know what he had looked like, except a funeral with the
addition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a
blue ribbon, that had given him the appearance of being insured in some
extraordinary Fire Office. But I said he had looked very nice.
 
"When he come to the grave," said our conductor, "he showed his cloak
beautiful. But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that when he
see the ghost in the queens apartment, he might have made more of his
stockings."
 
I modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door,
into a sort of hot packingcase immediately behind it. Here Mr. Wopsle
was divesting himself of his Danish garments, and here there was just
room for us to look at him over one anothers shoulders, by keeping the
packingcase door, or lid, wide open.
 
"Gentlemen," said Mr. Wopsle, "I am proud to see you. I hope, Mr. Pip,
you will excuse my sending round. I had the happiness to know you in
former times, and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been
acknowledged, on the noble and the affluent."
 
Meanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying to
get himself out of his princely sables.
 
"Skin the stockings off Mr. Waldengarver," said the owner of that
property, "or youll bust em. Bust em, and youll bust fiveandthirty
shillings. Shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair. Keep
quiet in your chair now, and leave em to me."
 
With that, he went upon his knees, and began to flay his victim who, on
the first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen over backward
with his chair, but for there being no room to fall anyhow.
 
I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play. But then, Mr.
Waldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said,
 
"Gentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?"
 
Herbert said from behind at the same time poking me, "Capitally." So I
said "Capitally."
 
"How did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?" said Mr.
Waldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.
 
Herbert said from behind again poking me, "Massive and concrete." So I
said boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon it,
"Massive and concrete."
 
"I am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen," said Mr. Waldengarver,
with an air of dignity, in spite of his being ground against the wall at
the time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.
 
"But Ill tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver," said the man who was on
his knees, "in which youre out in your reading. Now mind! I dont care
who says contrairy I tell you so. Youre out in your reading of Hamlet
when you get your legs in profile. The last Hamlet as I dressed, made
the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him to put a
large red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal which
was the last I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and whenever
his reading brought him into profile, I called out "I dont see no
wafers!" And at night his reading was lovely."
 
Mr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say "a faithful
DependentI overlook his folly" and then said aloud, "My view is a
little classic and thoughtful for them here but they will improve, they
will improve."
 
Herbert and I said together, O, no doubt they would improve.
 
"Did you observe, gentlemen," said Mr. Waldengarver, "that there was a
man in the gallery who endeavored to cast derision on the service,I
mean, the representation?"
 
We basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man. I
added, "He was drunk, no doubt."
 
"O dear no, sir," said Mr. Wopsle, "not drunk. His employer would see to
that, sir. His employer would not allow him to be drunk."
 
"You know his employer?" said I.
 
Mr. Wopsle shut his eyes, and opened them again performing both
ceremonies very slowly. "You must have observed, gentlemen," said he,
"an ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenance
expressive of low malignity, who went throughI will not say
sustainedthe rôle if I may use a French expression of Claudius, King
of Denmark. That is his employer, gentlemen. Such is the profession!"
 
Without distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for Mr.
Wopsle if he had been in despair, I was so sorry for him as it was,
that I took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces
put on,which jostled us out at the doorway,to ask Herbert what he
thought of having him home to supper? Herbert said he thought it would
be kind to do so therefore I invited him, and he went to Barnards
with us, wrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for him, and he sat
until two oclock in the morning, reviewing his success and developing
his plans. I forget in detail what they were, but I have a general
recollection that he was to begin with reviving the Drama, and to end
with crushing it inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft
and without a chance or hope.
 
Miserably I went to bed after all, and miserably thought of Estella, and
miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled, and that I
had to give my hand in marriage to Herberts Clara, or play Hamlet to
Miss Havishams Ghost, before twenty thousand people, without knowing
twenty words of it.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXXII
 
One day when I was busy with my books and Mr. Pocket, I received a note
by the post, the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter
for, though I had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed,
I divined whose hand it was. It had no set beginning, as Dear Mr. Pip,
or Dear Pip, or Dear Sir, or Dear Anything, but ran thus
 
"I am to come to London the day after tomorrow by the midday coach. I
believe it was settled you should meet me? At all events Miss Havisham
has that impression, and I write in obedience to it. She sends you her
regard.
 
"Yours, ESTELLA."
 
If there had been time, I should probably have ordered several suits
of clothes for this occasion but as there was not, I was fain to be
content with those I had. My appetite vanished instantly, and I knew
no peace or rest until the day arrived. Not that its arrival brought
me either for, then I was worse than ever, and began haunting the
coachoffice in Wood Street, Cheapside, before the coach had left the
Blue Boar in our town. For all that I knew this perfectly well, I still
felt as if it were not safe to let the coachoffice be out of my sight
longer than five minutes at a time and in this condition of unreason I
had performed the first halfhour of a watch of four or five hours, when
Wemmick ran against me.
 
"Halloa, Mr. Pip," said he "how do you do? I should hardly have thought
this was your beat."
 
I explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by
coach, and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged.
 
"Both flourishing thankye," said Wemmick, "and particularly the Aged.
Hes in wonderful feather. Hell be eightytwo next birthday. I have
a notion of firing eightytwo times, if the neighborhood shouldnt
complain, and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure.
However, this is not London talk. Where do you think I am going to?"
 
"To the office?" said I, for he was tending in that direction.
 
"Next thing to it," returned Wemmick, "I am going to Newgate. We are in
a bankersparcel case just at present, and I have been down the road
taking a squint at the scene of action, and thereupon must have a word
or two with our client."
 
"Did your client commit the robbery?" I asked.
 
"Bless your soul and body, no," answered Wemmick, very drily. "But he
is accused of it. So might you or I be. Either of us might be accused of
it, you know."
 
"Only neither of us is," I remarked.
 
"Yah!" said Wemmick, touching me on the breast with his forefinger
"youre a deep one, Mr. Pip! Would you like to have a look at Newgate?
Have you time to spare?"
 
I had so much time to spare, that the proposal came as a relief,
notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my
eye on the coachoffice. Muttering that I would make the inquiry whether
I had time to walk with him, I went into the office, and ascertained
from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his
temper, the earliest moment at which the coach could be expected,which
I knew beforehand, quite as well as he. I then rejoined Mr. Wemmick, and
affecting to consult my watch, and to be surprised by the information I
had received, accepted his offer.
 
We were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodge
where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison
rules, into the interior of the jail. At that time jails were much
neglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on
all public wrongdoingand which is always its heaviest and longest
punishmentwas still far off. So felons were not lodged and fed better
than soldiers, to say nothing of paupers, and seldom set fire to their
prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of their soup.
It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in, and a potman was going his
rounds with beer and the prisoners, behind bars in yards, were buying
beer, and talking to friends and a frowzy, ugly, disorderly, depressing
scene it was.
 
It struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener
might walk among his plants. This was first put into my head by his
seeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, "What, Captain
Tom? Are you there? Ah, indeed!" and also, "Is that Black Bill behind
the cistern? Why I didnt look for you these two months how do you find
yourself?" Equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to
anxious whisperers,always singly,Wemmick with his postoffice in
an immovable state, looked at them while in conference, as if he were
taking particular notice of the advance they had made, since last
observed, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.
 
He was highly popular, and I found that he took the familiar department
of Mr. Jaggerss business though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers
hung about him too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits. His
personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod,
and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both
hands, and then tightening the postoffice, and putting his hands in his
pockets. In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the
raising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possible from
the insufficient money produced, said, "its no use, my boy. Im only
a subordinate. I cant take it. Dont go on in that way with a
subordinate. If you are unable to make up your quantum, my boy, you had
better address yourself to a principal there are plenty of principals
in the profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one, may
be worth the while of another thats my recommendation to you, speaking
as a subordinate. Dont try on useless measures. Why should you? Now,
whos next?"
 
Thus, we walked through Wemmicks greenhouse, until he turned to me and
said, "Notice the man I shall shake hands with." I should have done so,
without the preparation, as he had shaken hands with no one yet.
 
Almost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man whom I can
see now, as I write in a wellworn olivecolored frockcoat, with a
peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion, and eyes that
went wandering about when he tried to fix them, came up to a corner
of the bars, and put his hand to his hatwhich had a greasy and fatty
surface like cold brothwith a halfserious and halfjocose military
salute.
 
"Colonel, to you!" said Wemmick "how are you, Colonel?"
 
"All right, Mr. Wemmick."
 
"Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too strong
for us, Colonel."
 
"Yes, it was too strong, sir,but I dont care."
 
"No, no," said Wemmick, coolly, "you dont care." Then, turning to me,
"Served His Majesty this man. Was a soldier in the line and bought his
discharge."
 
I said, "Indeed?" and the mans eyes looked at me, and then looked over
my head, and then looked all round me, and then he drew his hand across
his lips and laughed.
 
"I think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir," he said to Wemmick.
 
"Perhaps," returned my friend, "but theres no knowing."
 
"I am glad to have the chance of bidding you good by, Mr. Wemmick," said
the man, stretching out his hand between two bars.
 
"Thankye," said Wemmick, shaking hands with him. "Same to you, Colonel."
 
"If what I had upon me when taken had been real, Mr. Wemmick," said the
man, unwilling to let his hand go, "I should have asked the favor of
your wearing another ringin acknowledgment of your attentions."
 
"Ill accept the will for the deed," said Wemmick. "By the by you were
quite a pigeonfancier." The man looked up at the sky. "I am told you
had a remarkable breed of tumblers. Could you commission any friend of
yours to bring me a pair, of youve no further use for em?"
 
"It shall be done, sir?"
 
"All right," said Wemmick, "they shall be taken care of. Good afternoon,
Colonel. Good by!" They shook hands again, and as we walked away Wemmick
said to me, "A Coiner, a very good workman. The Recorders report is
made today, and he is sure to be executed on Monday. Still you see, as
far as it goes, a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same."
With that, he looked back, and nodded at this dead plant, and then cast
his eyes about him in walking out of the yard, as if he were considering
what other pot would go best in its place.
 
As we came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the great
importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys, no less
than by those whom they held in charge. "Well, Mr. Wemmick," said the
turnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates,
and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other, "whats Mr.
Jaggers going to do with that waterside murder? Is he going to make it
manslaughter, or whats he going to make of it?"
 
"Why dont you ask him?" returned Wemmick.
 
"O yes, I dare say!" said the turnkey.
 
"Now, thats the way with them here, Mr. Pip," remarked Wemmick, turning
to me with his postoffice elongated. "They dont mind what they ask of
me, the subordinate but youll never catch em asking any questions of
my principal."
 
"Is this young gentleman one of the prentices or articled ones of your
office?" asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mr. Wemmicks humor.
 
"There he goes again, you see!" cried Wemmick, "I told you so! Asks
another question of the subordinate before his first is dry! Well,
supposing Mr. Pip is one of them?"
 
"Why then," said the turnkey, grinning again, "he knows what Mr. Jaggers
is."
 
"Yah!" cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious
way, "youre dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my
principal, you know you are. Let us out, you old fox, or Ill get him to
bring an action against you for false imprisonment."
 
The turnkey laughed, and gave us good day, and stood laughing at us over
the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street.
 
"Mind you, Mr. Pip," said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he took my arm
to be more confidential "I dont know that Mr. Jaggers does a better
thing than the way in which he keeps himself so high. Hes always so
high. His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities. That
Colonel durst no more take leave of him, than that turnkey durst ask him
his intentions respecting a case. Then, between his height and them, he
slips in his subordinate,dont you see?and so he has em, soul and
body."
 
I was very much impressed, and not for the first time, by my guardians
subtlety. To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and not for the
first time, that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities.
 
Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where
suppliants for Mr. Jaggerss notice were lingering about as usual, and I
returned to my watch in the street of the coachoffice, with some three
hours on hand. I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it
was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime
that, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening, I
should have first encountered it that, it should have reappeared on two
occasions, starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone that,
it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement. While my
mind was thus engaged, I thought of the beautiful young Estella, proud
and refined, coming towards me, and I thought with absolute abhorrence
of the contrast between the jail and her. I wished that Wemmick had not
met me, or that I had not yielded to him and gone with him, so that,
of all days in the year on this day, I might not have had Newgate in
my breath and on my clothes. I beat the prison dust off my feet as I
sauntered to and fro, and I shook it out of my dress, and I exhaled
its air from my lungs. So contaminated did I feel, remembering who was
coming, that the coach came quickly after all, and I was not yet free
from the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmicks conservatory, when I saw
her face at the coach window and her hand waving to me.
 
What was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed?
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXXIII
 
In her furred travellingdress, Estella seemed more delicately beautiful
than she had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes. Her manner was more
winning than she had cared to let it be to me before, and I thought I
saw Miss Havishams influence in the change.
 
We stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me, and
when it was all collected I rememberedhaving forgotten everything but
herself in the meanwhilethat I knew nothing of her destination.
 
"I am going to Richmond," she told me. "Our lesson is, that there are
two Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the
Surrey Richmond. The distance is ten miles. I am to have a carriage, and
you are to take me. This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges out
of it. O, you must take the purse! We have no choice, you and I, but to
obey our instructions. We are not free to follow our own devices, you
and I."
 
As she looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an
inner meaning in her words. She said them slightingly, but not with
displeasure.
 
"A carriage will have to be sent for, Estella. Will you rest here a
little?"
 
"Yes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you
are to take care of me the while."
 
She drew her arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a
waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen
such a thing in his life, to show us a private sittingroom. Upon that,
he pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clew without which he
couldnt find the way up stairs, and led us to the black hole of the
establishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror quite a superfluous
article, considering the holes proportions, an anchovy saucecruet,
and somebodys pattens. On my objecting to this retreat, he took us into
another room with a dinnertable for thirty, and in the grate a scorched
leaf of a copybook under a bushel of coaldust. Having looked at this
extinct conflagration and shaken his head, he took my order which,
proving to be merely, "Some tea for the lady," sent him out of the room
in a very low state of mind.
 
I was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong
combination of stable with soupstock, might have led one to infer that
the coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising
proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.
Yet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it. I thought that
with her I could have been happy there for life. I was not at all happy
there at the time, observe, and I knew it well.
 
"Where are you going to, at Richmond?" I asked Estella.
 
"I am going to live," said she, "at a great expense, with a lady there,
who has the poweror says she hasof taking me about, and introducing
me, and showing people to me and showing me to people."
 
"I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?"
 
"Yes, I suppose so."
 
She answered so carelessly, that I said, "You speak of yourself as if
you were some one else."
 
"Where did you learn how I speak of others? Come, come," said Estella,
smiling delightfully, "you must not expect me to go to school to you I
must talk in my own way. How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?"
 
"I live quite pleasantly there at least" It appeared to me that I was
losing a chance.
 
"At least?" repeated Estella.
 
"As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you."
 
"You silly boy," said Estella, quite composedly, "how can you talk such
nonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest of
his family?"
 
"Very superior indeed. He is nobodys enemy" "Dont add but his
own," interposed Estella, "for I hate that class of man. But he really
is disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite, I have heard?"
 
"I am sure I have every reason to say so."
 
"You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people," said
Estella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once
grave and rallying, "for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and
insinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you,
write letters about you anonymous sometimes, and you are the torment
and the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realize to yourself
the hatred those people feel for you."
 
"They do me no harm, I hope?"
 
Instead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was very singular
to me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity. When she left
offand she had not laughed languidly, but with real enjoymentI said,
in my diffident way with her,
 
"I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any
harm."
 
"No, no you may be sure of that," said Estella. "You may be certain that
I laugh because they fail. O, those people with Miss Havisham, and the
tortures they undergo!" She laughed again, and even now when she had
told me why, her laughter was very singular to me, for I could not
doubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion.
I thought there must really be something more here than I knew she saw
the thought in my mind, and answered it.
 
"It is not easy for even you." said Estella, "to know what satisfaction
it gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of
the ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For you were not
brought up in that strange house from a mere baby. I was. You had not
your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed
and defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that
is soft and soothing. I had. You did not gradually open your round
childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a
woman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up
in the night. I did."
 
It was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning these
remembrances from any shallow place. I would not have been the cause of
that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap.
 
"Two things I can tell you," said Estella. "First, notwithstanding the
proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set
your mind at rest that these people never willnever would, in hundred
yearsimpair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great
or small. Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so
busy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it."
 
As she gave it to me playfully,for her darker mood had been but
Momentary,I held it and put it to my lips. "You ridiculous boy," said
Estella, "will you never take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in the
same spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?"
 
"What spirit was that?" said I.
 
"I must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners and
plotters."
 
"If I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?"
 
"You should have asked before you touched the hand. But, yes, if you
like."
 
I leaned down, and her calm face was like a statues. "Now," said
Estella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, "you are to take
care that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond."
 
Her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon
us, and we were mere puppets, gave me pain but everything in our
intercourse did give me pain. Whatever her tone with me happened to be,
I could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it and yet I went on
against trust and against hope. Why repeat it a thousand times? So it
always was.
 
I rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clew,
brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but of
tea not a glimpse. A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and
forks including carvers, spoons various, saltcellars, a meek little
muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover,
Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of
parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof impressions of
the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread, and
ultimately a fat family urn which the waiter staggered in with,
expressing in his countenance burden and suffering. After a prolonged
absence at this stage of the entertainment, he at length came back with
a casket of precious appearance containing twigs. These I steeped in hot
water, and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of I
dont know what for Estella.
 
The bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten,
and the chambermaid taken into consideration,in a word, the whole
house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estellas purse
much lightened,we got into our postcoach and drove away. Turning into
Cheapside and rattling up Newgate Street, we were soon under the walls
of which I was so ashamed.
 
"What place is that?" Estella asked me.
 
I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognizing it, and then
told her. As she looked at it, and drew in her head again,
murmuring, "Wretches!" I would not have confessed to my visit for any
consideration.
 
"Mr. Jaggers," said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else,
"has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place
than any man in London."
 
"He is more in the secrets of every place, I think," said Estella, in a
low voice.
 
"You have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?"
 
"I have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever since
I can remember. But I know him no better now, than I did before I could
speak plainly. What is your own experience of him? Do you advance with
him?"
 
"Once habituated to his distrustful manner," said I, "I have done very
well."
 
"Are you intimate?"
 
"I have dined with him at his private house."
 
"I fancy," said Estella, shrinking "that must be a curious place."
 
"It is a curious place."
 
I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with
her but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe
the dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a sudden
glare of gas. It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive
with that inexplicable feeling I had had before and when we were out of
it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in lightning.
 
So we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by
which we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this
side of it, and what on that. The great city was almost new to her, she
told me, for she had never left Miss Havishams neighborhood until she
had gone to France, and she had merely passed through London then in
going and returning. I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her
while she remained here? To that she emphatically said "God forbid!" and
no more.
 
It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me
that she made herself winning, and would have won me even if the task
had needed pains. Yet this made me none the happier, for even if she had
not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should have
felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose to do
it, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to crush
it and throw it away.
 
When we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr. Matthew
Pocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I
hoped I should see her sometimes.
 
"O yes, you are to see me you are to come when you think proper you
are to be mentioned to the family indeed you are already mentioned."
 
I inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of?
 
"No there are only two mother and daughter. The mother is a lady of
some station, though not averse to increasing her income."
 
"I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon."
 
"It is a part of Miss Havishams plans for me, Pip," said Estella, with
a sigh, as if she were tired "I am to write to her constantly and see
her regularly and report how I go on,I and the jewels,for they are
nearly all mine now."
 
It was the first time she had ever called me by my name. Of course she
did so purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.
 
We came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there was a house
by the green,a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches,
embroidered coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had their
court days many a time. Some ancient trees before the house were still
cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and
stiff skirts but their own allotted places in the great procession of
the dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and go the
silent way of the rest.
 
A bell with an old voicewhich I dare say in its time had often said
to the house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamondhilted
sword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitairesounded
gravely in the moonlight, and two cherrycolored maids came fluttering
out to receive Estella. The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and she
gave me her hand and a smile, and said good night, and was absorbed
likewise. And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy I
should be if I lived there with her, and knowing that I never was happy
with her, but always miserable.
 
I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got in
with a bad heartache, and I got out with a worse heartache. At our
own door, I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party
escorted by her little lover and I envied her little lover, in spite of
his being subject to Flopson.
 
Mr. Pocket was out lecturing for, he was a most delightful lecturer on
domestic economy, and his treatises on the management of children and
servants were considered the very best textbooks on those themes. But
Mrs. Pocket was at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account of
the babys having been accommodated with a needlecase to keep him quiet
during the unaccountable absence with a relative in the Foot Guards
of Millers. And more needles were missing than it could be regarded
as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply
externally or to take as a tonic.
 
Mr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical
advice, and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a
highly judicious mind, I had some notion in my heartache of begging him
to accept my confidence. But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as she
sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing Bed as a sovereign
remedy for baby, I thoughtWellNo, I wouldnt.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXXIV
 
As I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly begun to
notice their effect upon myself and those around me. Their influence on
my own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible,
but I knew very well that it was not all good. I lived in a state of
chronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to Joe. My conscience was not
by any means comfortable about Biddy. When I woke up in the night,like
Camilla,I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits, that I should
have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss Havishams face,
and had risen to manhood content to be partners with Joe in the honest
old forge. Many a time of an evening, when I sat alone looking at the
fire, I thought, after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the
kitchen fire at home.
 
Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of
mind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part
in its production. That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations,
and yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make out to my
satisfaction that I should have done much better. Now, concerning the
influence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and so
I perceivedthough dimly enough perhapsthat it was not beneficial
to anybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert.
My lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not
afford, corrupted the simplicity of his life, and disturbed his peace
with anxieties and regrets. I was not at all remorseful for having
unwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor
arts they practised because such littlenesses were their natural
bent, and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them
slumbering. But Herberts was a very different case, and it often caused
me a twinge to think that I had done him evil service in crowding his
sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work, and placing
the Canarybreasted Avenger at his disposal.
 
So now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I began
to contract a quantity of debt. I could hardly begin but Herbert
must begin too, so he soon followed. At Startops suggestion, we put
ourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the Grove
the object of which institution I have never divined, if it were not
that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to quarrel
among themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to cause six
waiters to get drunk on the stairs. I know that these gratifying social
ends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and I understood
nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the
society which ran "Gentlemen, may the present promotion of good feeling
ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove."
 
The Finches spent their money foolishly the Hotel we dined at was
in Covent Garden, and the first Finch I saw when I had the honor of
joining the Grove was Bentley Drummle, at that time floundering about
town in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts
at the street corners. Occasionally, he shot himself out of his equipage
headforemost over the apron and I saw him on one occasion deliver
himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional waylike coals.
But here I anticipate a little, for I was not a Finch, and could not be,
according to the sacred laws of the society, until I came of age.
 
In my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken
Herberts expenses on myself but Herbert was proud, and I could make
no such proposal to him. So he got into difficulties in every direction,
and continued to look about him. When we gradually fell into keeping
late hours and late company, I noticed that he looked about him with a
desponding eye at breakfasttime that he began to look about him more
hopefully about midday that he drooped when he came into dinner
that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance, rather clearly, after
dinner that he all but realized Capital towards midnight and that at
about two oclock in the morning, he became so deeply despondent again
as to talk of buying a rifle and going to America, with a general
purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune.
 
I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was at
Hammersmith I haunted Richmond, whereof separately by and by. Herbert
would often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at those
seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that
the opening he was looking for, had not appeared yet. But in the general
tumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere, was
a thing to transact itself somehow. In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew
grayer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by the
hair. While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool, read
her book of dignities, lost her pockethandkerchief, told us about her
grandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting it into
bed whenever it attracted her notice.
 
As I am now generalizing a period of my life with the object of clearing
my way before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at once completing
the description of our usual manners and customs at Barnards Inn.
 
We spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people
could make up their minds to give us. We were always more or less
miserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition.
There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying
ourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did. To the best of my
belief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one.
 
Every morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to look
about him. I often paid him a visit in the dark backroom in which
he consorted with an inkjar, a hatpeg, a coalbox, a stringbox, an
almanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler and I do not remember that I
ever saw him do anything else but look about him. If we all did what
we undertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a
Republic of the Virtues. He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except
at a certain hour of every afternoon to "go to Lloyds"in observance
of a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think. He never did anything
else in connection with Lloyds that I could find out, except come back
again. When he felt his case unusually serious, and that he positively
must find an opening, he would go on Change at a busy time, and walk in
and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the assembled
magnates. "For," says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on one
of those special occasions, "I find the truth to be, Handel, that an
opening wont come to one, but one must go to it,so I have been."
 
If we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated
one another regularly every morning. I detested the chambers beyond
expression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the
sight of the Avengers livery which had a more expensive and a
less remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the
fourandtwenty hours. As we got more and more into debt, breakfast
became a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at
breakfasttime threatened by letter with legal proceedings, "not
unwholly unconnected," as my local paper might put it, "with jewelery,"
I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake
him off his feet,so that he was actually in the air, like a booted
Cupid,for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll.
 
At certain timesmeaning at uncertain times, for they depended on our
humorI would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery,
 
"My dear Herbert, we are getting on badly."
 
"My dear Handel," Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, "if you will
believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange coincidence."
 
"Then, Herbert," I would respond, "let us look into our affairs."
 
We always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for
this purpose. I always thought this was business, this was the way to
confront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. And
I know Herbert thought so too.
 
We ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of
something similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds might
be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the mark.
Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of ink, and
a goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For there was something
very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.
 
I would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in a
neat hand, the heading, "Memorandum of Pips debts" with Barnards Inn
and the date very carefully added. Herbert would also take a sheet of
paper, and write across it with similar formalities, "Memorandum of
Herberts debts."
 
Each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side,
which had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half
burnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the lookingglass, and
otherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly,
insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this
edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money. In point of
meritorious character, the two things seemed about equal.
 
When we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on?
Herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful
manner at the sight of his accumulating figures.
 
"They are mounting up, Handel," Herbert would say "upon my life, they
are mounting up."
 
"Be firm, Herbert," I would retort, plying my own pen with great
assiduity. "Look the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Stare
them out of countenance."
 
"So I would, Handel, only they are staring me out of countenance."
 
However, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would
fall to work again. After a time he would give up once more, on the plea
that he had not got Cobbss bill, or Lobbss, or Nobbss, as the case
might be.
 
"Then, Herbert, estimate estimate it in round numbers, and put it
down."
 
"What a fellow of resource you are!" my friend would reply, with
admiration. "Really your business powers are very remarkable."
 
I thought so too. I established with myself, on these occasions,
the reputation of a firstrate man of business,prompt, decisive,
energetic, clear, coolheaded. When I had got all my responsibilities
down upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. My
selfapproval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.
When I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly,
docketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical
bundle. Then I did the same for Herbert who modestly said he had not my
administrative genius, and felt that I had brought his affairs into a
focus for him.
 
My business habits had one other bright feature, which I called "leaving
a Margin." For example supposing Herberts debts to be one hundred and
sixtyfour pounds fourandtwopence, I would say, "Leave a margin, and
put them down at two hundred." Or, supposing my own to be four times as
much, I would leave a margin, and put them down at seven hundred. I had
the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin, but I am bound
to acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to have been an expensive
device. For, we always ran into new debt immediately, to the full extent
of the margin, and sometimes, in the sense of freedom and solvency it
imparted, got pretty far on into another margin.
 
But there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on these
examinations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirable
opinion of myself. Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herberts
compliments, I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the
table before me among the stationary, and feel like a Bank of some sort,
rather than a private individual.
 
We shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we might
not be interrupted. I had fallen into my serene state one evening, when
we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door, and fall on
the ground. "Its for you, Handel," said Herbert, going out and coming
back with it, "and I hope there is nothing the matter." This was in
allusion to its heavy black seal and border.
 
The letter was signed Trabb  Co., and its contents were simply, that
I was an honored sir, and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J.
Gargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes past six
in the evening, and that my attendance was requested at the interment on
Monday next at three oclock in the afternoon.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXXV
 
It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and
the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful. The figure of my
sister in her chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day. That
the place could possibly be, without her, was something my mind seemed
unable to compass and whereas she had seldom or never been in my
thoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she was coming
towards me in the street, or that she would presently knock at the door.
In my rooms too, with which she had never been at all associated, there
was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the
sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure, as if she were
still alive and had been often there.
 
Whatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled my
sister with much tenderness. But I suppose there is a shock of regret
which may exist without much tenderness. Under its influence and
perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling I was seized with
a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had suffered
so much and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have revengefully
pursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity.
 
Having written to Joe, to offer him consolation, and to assure him
that I would come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in
the curious state of mind I have glanced at. I went down early in the
morning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the
forge.
 
It was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the times
when I was a little helpless creature, and my sister did not spare me,
vividly returned. But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that
softened even the edge of Tickler. For now, the very breath of the beans
and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would
be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be
softened as they thought of me.
 
At last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co. had
put in a funereal execution and taken possession. Two dismally absurd
persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black
bandage,as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort
to anybody,were posted at the front door and in one of them I
recognized a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young couple
into a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of intoxication
rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck
with both arms. All the children of the village, and most of the women,
were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house
and forge and as I came up, one of the two warders the postboy
knocked at the door,implying that I was far too much exhausted by
grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.
 
Another sable warder a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for a
wager opened the door, and showed me into the best parlor. Here, Mr.
Trabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leaves
up, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity
of black pins. At the moment of my arrival, he had just finished putting
somebodys hat into black longclothes, like an African baby so he held
out his hand for mine. But I, misled by the action, and confused by the
occasion, shook hands with him with every testimony of warm affection.
 
Poor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow
under his chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room where,
as chief mourner, he had evidently been stationed by Trabb. When I bent
down and said to him, "Dear Joe, how are you?" he said, "Pip, old chap,
you knowed her when she were a fine figure of a" and clasped my hand
and said no more.
 
Biddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went quietly
here and there, and was very helpful. When I had spoken to Biddy, as
I thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and
there began to wonder in what part of the house itshemy sisterwas.
The air of the parlor being faint with the smell of sweetcake, I looked
about for the table of refreshments it was scarcely visible until one
had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cutup plum cake upon
it, and there were cutup oranges, and sandwiches, and biscuits, and two
decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had never seen used
in all my life one full of port, and one of sherry. Standing at this
table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook in a black cloak
and several yards of hatband, who was alternately stuffing himself,
and making obsequious movements to catch my attention. The moment he
succeeded, he came over to me breathing sherry and crumbs, and said
in a subdued voice, "May I, dear sir?" and did. I then descried Mr. and
Mrs. Hubble the lastnamed in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner.
We were all going to "follow," and were all in course of being tied up
separately by Trabb into ridiculous bundles.
 
"Which I meantersay, Pip," Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr.
Trabb called "formed" in the parlor, two and two,and it was dreadfully
like a preparation for some grim kind of dance "which I meantersay,
sir, as I would in preference have carried her to the church myself,
along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts
and arms, but it were considered wot the neighbors would look down on
such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect."
 
"Pockethandkerchiefs out, all!" cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in a
depressed businesslike voice. "Pockethandkerchiefs out! We are ready!"
 
So we all put our pockethandkerchiefs to our faces, as if our
noses were bleeding, and filed out two and two Joe and I Biddy and
Pumblechook Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. The remains of my poor sister had been
brought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point of Undertaking
ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a
horrible black velvet housing with a white border, the whole looked like
a blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling and blundering along,
under the guidance of two keepers,the postboy and his comrade.
 
The neighborhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and we
were much admired as we went through the village the more youthful and
vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off,
and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage. At such times
the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our
emergence round some corner of expectancy, "Here they come!" "Here they
are!" and we were all but cheered. In this progress I was much annoyed
by the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted all the way
as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband, and smoothing
my cloak. My thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of
Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in
being members of so distinguished a procession.
 
And now the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of the
ships on the river growing out of it and we went into the churchyard,
close to the graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of this
parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above. And there, my sister was
laid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and the
light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.
 
Of the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing,
I desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me and that even
when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought
nothing into the world and can take nothing out, and how it fleeth like
a shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard him cough a
reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into
large property. When we got back, he had the hardihood to tell me that
he wished my sister could have known I had done her so much honor, and
to hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased at the
price of her death. After that, he drank all the rest of the sherry,
and Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the two talked which I have since
observed to be customary in such cases as if they were of quite another
race from the deceased, and were notoriously immortal. Finally, he went
away with Mr. and Mrs. Hubble,to make an evening of it, I felt sure,
and to tell the Jolly Bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes
and my earliest benefactor.
 
When they were all gone, and when Trabb and his menbut not his Boy I
looked for himhad crammed their mummery into bags, and were gone too,
the house felt wholesomer. Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a
cold dinner together but we dined in the best parlor, not in the old
kitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his
knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was great
restraint upon us. But after dinner, when I made him take his pipe,
and when I had loitered with him about the forge, and when we sat down
together on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better. I
noticed that after the funeral Joe changed his clothes so far, as to
make a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress in which
the dear fellow looked natural, and like the Man he was.
 
He was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little
room, and I was pleased too for I felt that I had done rather a great
thing in making the request. When the shadows of evening were closing
in, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a
little talk.
 
"Biddy," said I, "I think you might have written to me about these sad
matters."
 
"Do you, Mr. Pip?" said Biddy. "I should have written if I had thought
that."
 
"Dont suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I consider
that you ought to have thought that."
 
"Do you, Mr. Pip?"
 
She was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with
her, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again. After
looking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me, I gave up
that point.
 
"I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy dear?"
 
"Oh! I cant do so, Mr. Pip," said Biddy, in a tone of regret but still
of quiet conviction. "I have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I am
going to her tomorrow. I hope we shall be able to take some care of Mr.
Gargery, together, until he settles down."
 
"How are you going to live, Biddy? If you want any mo"
 
"How am I going to live?" repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentary
flush upon her face. "Ill tell you, Mr. Pip. I am going to try to get
the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here. I can be
well recommended by all the neighbors, and I hope I can be industrious
and patient, and teach myself while I teach others. You know, Mr. Pip,"
pursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to my face, "the new
schools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from you after
that time, and have had time since then to improve."
 
"I think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances."
 
"Ah! Except in my bad side of human nature," murmured Biddy.
 
It was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud. Well!
I thought I would give up that point too. So, I walked a little further
with Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.
 
"I have not heard the particulars of my sisters death, Biddy."
 
"They are very slight, poor thing. She had been in one of her bad
statesthough they had got better of late, rather than worsefor four
days, when she came out of it in the evening, just at teatime, and said
quite plainly, Joe. As she had never said any word for a long while, I
ran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge. She made signs to me that
she wanted him to sit down close to her, and wanted me to put her arms
round his neck. So I put them round his neck, and she laid her head down
on his shoulder quite content and satisfied. And so she presently said
Joe again, and once Pardon, and once Pip. And so she never lifted
her head up any more, and it was just an hour later when we laid it down
on her own bed, because we found she was gone."
 
Biddy cried the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that were
coming out, were blurred in my own sight.
 
"Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?"
 
"Nothing."
 
"Do you know what is become of Orlick?"
 
"I should think from the color of his clothes that he is working in the
quarries."
 
"Of course you have seen him then?Why are you looking at that dark
tree in the lane?"
 
"I saw him there, on the night she died."
 
"That was not the last time either, Biddy?"
 
"No I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.It is of
no use," said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for running
out, "you know I would not deceive you he was not there a minute, and
he is gone."
 
It revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by
this fellow, and I felt inveterate against him. I told her so, and told
her that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of
that country. By degrees she led me into more temperate talk, and she
told me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,she
didnt say, of me she had no need I knew what she meant,but ever did
his duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a
gentle heart.
 
"Indeed, it would be hard to say too much for him," said I "and Biddy,
we must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often down
here now. I am not going to leave poor Joe alone."
 
Biddy said never a single word.
 
"Biddy, dont you hear me?"
 
"Yes, Mr. Pip."
 
"Not to mention your calling me Mr. Pip,which appears to me to be in
bad taste, Biddy,what do you mean?"
 
"What do I mean?" asked Biddy, timidly.
 
"Biddy," said I, in a virtuously selfasserting manner, "I must request
to know what you mean by this?"
 
"By this?" said Biddy.
 
"Now, dont echo," I retorted. "You used not to echo, Biddy."
 
"Used not!" said Biddy. "O Mr. Pip! Used!"
 
Well! I rather thought I would give up that point too. After another
silent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position.
 
"Biddy," said I, "I made a remark respecting my coming down here often,
to see Joe, which you received with a marked silence. Have the goodness,
Biddy, to tell me why."
 
"Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?" asked
Biddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under the
stars with a clear and honest eye.
 
"O dear me!" said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in
despair. "This really is a very bad side of human nature! Dont say any
more, if you please, Biddy. This shocks me very much."
 
For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and
when I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of her
as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the churchyard
and the event of the day. As often as I was restless in the night, and
that was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an unkindness, what
an injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.
 
Early in the morning I was to go. Early in the morning I was out, and
looking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge. There
I stood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow of
health and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright sun
of the life in store for him were shining on it.
 
"Good by, dear Joe!No, dont wipe it offfor Gods sake, give me your
blackened hand!I shall be down soon and often."
 
"Never too soon, sir," said Joe, "and never too often, Pip!"
 
Biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk and
a crust of bread. "Biddy," said I, when I gave her my hand at parting,
"I am not angry, but I am hurt."
 
"No, dont be hurt," she pleaded quite pathetically "let only me be
hurt, if I have been ungenerous."
 
Once more, the mists were rising as I walked away. If they disclosed to
me, as I suspect they did, that I should not come back, and that Biddy
was quite right, all I can say is,they were quite right too.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXXVI
 
Herbert and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing our
debts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the like exemplary
transactions and Time went on, whether or no, as he has a way of doing
and I came of age,in fulfilment of Herberts prediction, that I should
do so before I knew where I was.
 
Herbert himself had come of age eight months before me. As he had
nothing else than his majority to come into, the event did not make a
profound sensation in Barnards Inn. But we had looked forward to
my oneandtwentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations and
anticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly
help saying something definite on that occasion.
 
I had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when my
birthday was. On the day before it, I received an official note from
Wemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call
upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day. This convinced
us that something great was to happen, and threw me into an unusual
flutter when I repaired to my guardians office, a model of punctuality.
 
In the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, and
incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of
tissuepaper that I liked the look of. But he said nothing respecting
it, and motioned me with a nod into my guardians room. It was November,
and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against
the chimneypiece, with his hands under his coattails.
 
"Well, Pip," said he, "I must call you Mr. Pip today. Congratulations,
Mr. Pip."
 
We shook hands,he was always a remarkably short shaker,and I thanked
him.
 
"Take a chair, Mr. Pip," said my guardian.
 
As I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his
boots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time when
I had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the shelf
were not far from him, and their expression was as if they were making a
stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.
 
"Now my young friend," my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the
box, "I am going to have a word or two with you."
 
"If you please, sir."
 
"What do you suppose," said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the
ground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,"what
do you suppose you are living at the rate of?"
 
"At the rate of, sir?"
 
"At," repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling,
"therateof?" And then looked all round the room, and paused with his
pockethandkerchief in his hand, halfway to his nose.
 
I had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed
any slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly,
I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This reply
seemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, "I thought so!" and blew his
nose with an air of satisfaction.
 
"Now, I have asked you a question, my friend," said Mr. Jaggers. "Have
you anything to ask me?"
 
"Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several
questions, sir but I remember your prohibition."
 
"Ask one," said Mr. Jaggers.
 
"Is my benefactor to be made known to me today?"
 
"No. Ask another."
 
"Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?"
 
"Waive that, a moment," said Mr. Jaggers, "and ask another."
 
I looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from
the inquiry, "HaveIanything to receive, sir?" On that, Mr. Jaggers
said, triumphantly, "I thought we should come to it!" and called to
Wemmick to give him that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed it in,
and disappeared.
 
"Now, Mr. Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, "attend, if you please. You have been
drawing pretty freely here your name occurs pretty often in Wemmicks
cashbook but you are in debt, of course?"
 
"I am afraid I must say yes, sir."
 
"You know you must say yes dont you?" said Mr. Jaggers.
 
"Yes, sir."
 
"I dont ask you what you owe, because you dont know and if you did
know, you wouldnt tell me you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend,"
cried Mr. Jaggers, waving his forefinger to stop me as I made a show
of protesting "its likely enough that you think you wouldnt, but
you would. Youll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take this
piece of paper in your hand. You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold it
and tell me what it is."
 
"This is a banknote," said I, "for five hundred pounds."
 
"That is a banknote," repeated Mr. Jaggers, "for five hundred pounds.
And a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?"
 
"How could I do otherwise!"
 
"Ah! But answer the question," said Mr. Jaggers.
 
"Undoubtedly."
 
"You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that
handsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this
day, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome
sum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until the
donor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take your money
affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from Wemmick
one hundred and twentyfive pounds per quarter, until you are in
communication with the fountainhead, and no longer with the mere
agent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my
instructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, but
I am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits."
 
I was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great
liberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me. "I am
not paid, Pip," said he, coolly, "to carry your words to any one" and
then gathered up his coattails, as he had gathered up the subject, and
stood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against
him.
 
After a pause, I hinted,
 
"There was a question just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired me to
waive for a moment. I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?"
 
"What is it?" said he.
 
I might have known that he would never help me out but it took me aback
to have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new. "Is it
likely," I said, after hesitating, "that my patron, the fountainhead
you have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon" there I delicately
stopped.
 
"Will soon what?" asked Mr. Jaggers. "Thats no question as it stands,
you know."
 
"Will soon come to London," said I, after casting about for a precise
form of words, "or summon me anywhere else?"
 
"Now, here," replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with
his dark deepset eyes, "we must revert to the evening when we first
encountered one another in your village. What did I tell you then, Pip?"
 
"You told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when that person
appeared."
 
"Just so," said Mr. Jaggers, "thats my answer."
 
As we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in my
strong desire to get something out of him. And as I felt that it came
quicker, and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker, I felt that I
had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him.
 
"Do you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?"
 
Mr. Jaggers shook his head,not in negativing the question, but in
altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer
it,and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when
my eyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in their
suspended attention, and were going to sneeze.
 
"Come!" said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his legs with the backs
of his warmed hands, "Ill be plain with you, my friend Pip. Thats a
question I must not be asked. Youll understand that better, when I tell
you its a question that might compromise me. Come! Ill go a little
further with you Ill say something more."
 
He bent down so low to frown at his boots, that he was able to rub the
calves of his legs in the pause he made.
 
"When that person discloses," said Mr. Jaggers, straightening himself,
"you and that person will settle your own affairs. When that person
discloses, my part in this business will cease and determine. When that
person discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anything about
it. And thats all I have got to say."
 
We looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and looked
thoughtfully at the floor. From this last speech I derived the notion
that Miss Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken him
into her confidence as to her designing me for Estella that he resented
this, and felt a jealousy about it or that he really did object to
that scheme, and would have nothing to do with it. When I raised my eyes
again, I found that he had been shrewdly looking at me all the time, and
was doing so still.
 
"If that is all you have to say, sir," I remarked, "there can be nothing
left for me to say."
 
He nodded assent, and pulled out his thiefdreaded watch, and asked me
where I was going to dine? I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert.
As a necessary sequence, I asked him if he would favor us with his
company, and he promptly accepted the invitation. But he insisted on
walking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparation
for him, and first he had a letter or two to write, and of course had
his hands to wash. So I said I would go into the outer office and talk
to Wemmick.
 
The fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket,
a thought had come into my head which had been often there before
and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise with
concerning such thought.
 
He had already locked up his safe, and made preparations for going home.
He had left his desk, brought out his two greasy office candlesticks and
stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door, ready to
be extinguished he had raked his fire low, put his hat and greatcoat
ready, and was beating himself all over the chest with his safekey, as
an athletic exercise after business.
 
"Mr. Wemmick," said I, "I want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous
to serve a friend."
 
Wemmick tightened his postoffice and shook his head, as if his opinion
were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.
 
"This friend," I pursued, "is trying to get on in commercial life,
but has no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a
beginning. Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning."
 
"With money down?" said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.
 
"With some money down," I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot across
me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home"with some money down,
and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations."
 
"Mr. Pip," said Wemmick, "I should like just to run over with you on my
fingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high
as Chelsea Reach. Lets see theres London, one Southwark, two
Blackfriars, three Waterloo, four Westminster, five Vauxhall, six."
He had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his
safekey on the palm of his hand. "Theres as many as six, you see, to
choose from."
 
"I dont understand you," said I.
 
"Choose your bridge, Mr. Pip," returned Wemmick, "and take a walk upon
your bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch
of your bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, and
you may know the end of it too,but its a less pleasant and profitable
end."
 
I could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide after
saying this.
 
"This is very discouraging," said I.
 
"Meant to be so," said Wemmick.
 
"Then is it your opinion," I inquired, with some little indignation,
"that a man should never"
 
"Invest portable property in a friend?" said Wemmick. "Certainly
he should not. Unless he wants to get rid of the friend,and then it
becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid
of him."
 
"And that," said I, "is your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?"
 
"That," he returned, "is my deliberate opinion in this office."
 
"Ah!" said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loophole
here "but would that be your opinion at Walworth?"
 
"Mr. Pip," he replied, with gravity, "Walworth is one place, and this
office is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is
another. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments
must be taken at Walworth none but my official sentiments can be taken
in this office."
 
"Very well," said I, much relieved, "then I shall look you up at
Walworth, you may depend upon it."
 
"Mr. Pip," he returned, "you will be welcome there, in a private and
personal capacity."
 
We had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my guardians
ears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he now appeared in his doorway,
towelling his hands, Wemmick got on his greatcoat and stood by to snuff
out the candles. We all three went into the street together, and from
the doorstep Wemmick turned his way, and Mr. Jaggers and I turned ours.
 
I could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers
had had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or
a Somebody, to unbend his brows a little. It was an uncomfortable
consideration on a twentyfirst birthday, that coming of age at all
seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he
made of it. He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than
Wemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to
dinner. And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy, because,
after he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyes fixed on the
fire, that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the
details of it, he felt so dejected and guilty.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXXVII
 
Deeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmicks Walworth
sentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage
to the Castle. On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union
Jack flying and the drawbridge up but undeterred by this show of
defiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most
pacific manner by the Aged.
 
"My son, sir," said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, "rather
had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he left word
that he would soon be home from his afternoons walk. He is very regular
in his walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is my son."
 
I nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and
we went in and sat down by the fireside.
 
"You made acquaintance with my son, sir," said the old man, in his
chirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, "at his office, I
expect?" I nodded. "Hah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at
his business, sir?" I nodded hard. "Yes so they tell me. His business
is the Law?" I nodded harder. "Which makes it more surprising in my
son," said the old man, "for he was not brought up to the Law, but to
the WineCoopering."
 
Curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the
reputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him. He threw me into
the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very
sprightly manner, "No, to be sure youre right." And to this hour I
have not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke he thought I
had made.
 
As I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without making
some other attempt to interest him, I shouted at inquiry whether his own
calling in life had been "the WineCoopering." By dint of straining that
term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on the
chest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in making my meaning
understood.
 
"No," said the old gentleman "the warehousing, the warehousing. First,
over yonder" he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he
intended to refer me to Liverpool "and then in the City of London here.
However, having an infirmityfor I am hard of hearing, sir"
 
I expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.
 
"Yes, hard of hearing having that infirmity coming upon me, my son he
went into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by little and little
made out this elegant and beautiful property. But returning to what you
said, you know," pursued the old man, again laughing heartily, "what I
say is, No to be sure youre right."
 
I was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled
me to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this
imaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall
on one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little
wooden flap with "JOHN" upon it. The old man, following my eyes, cried
with great triumph, "My sons come home!" and we both went out to the
drawbridge.
 
It was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the
other side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with
the greatest ease. The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge,
that I made no offer to assist him, but stood quiet until Wemmick had
come across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins a lady by whom he
was accompanied.
 
Miss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her escort, in
the postoffice branch of the service. She might have been some two or
three years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her to stand possessed
of portable property. The cut of her dress from the waist upward, both
before and behind, made her figure very like a boys kite and I might
have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange, and her gloves a
little too intensely green. But she seemed to be a good sort of fellow,
and showed a high regard for the Aged. I was not long in discovering
that she was a frequent visitor at the Castle for, on our going in,
and my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for announcing
himself to the Aged, he begged me to give my attention for a moment to
the other side of the chimney, and disappeared. Presently another click
came, and another little door tumbled open with "Miss Skiffins" on it
then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open then Miss Skiffins
and John both tumbled open together, and finally shut up together. On
Wemmicks return from working these mechanical appliances, I expressed
the great admiration with which I regarded them, and he said, "Well, you
know, theyre both pleasant and useful to the Aged. And by George, sir,
its a thing worth mentioning, that of all the people who come to
this gate, the secret of those pulls is only known to the Aged, Miss
Skiffins, and me!"
 
"And Mr. Wemmick made them," added Miss Skiffins, "with his own hands
out of his own head."
 
While Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet she retained her green
gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was
company, Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the property,
and see how the island looked in wintertime. Thinking that he did this
to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, I seized
the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.
 
Having thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I
had never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in
behalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and how
we had fought. I glanced at Herberts home, and at his character, and
at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for
those, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had
derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I
confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might
have done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havisham
in the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the possibility
of my having competed with him in his prospects, and at the certainty of
his possessing a generous soul, and being far above any mean distrusts,
retaliations, or designs. For all these reasons I told Wemmick,
and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a great
affection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays
upon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmicks experience and
knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my resources to
help Herbert to some present income,say of a hundred a year, to keep
him in good hope and heart,and gradually to buy him on to some small
partnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to understand that my help
must always be rendered without Herberts knowledge or suspicion, and
that there was no one else in the world with whom I could advise. I
wound up by laying my hand upon his shoulder, and saying, "I cant help
confiding in you, though I know it must be troublesome to you but that
is your fault, in having ever brought me here."
 
Wemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of
start, "Well you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing. This is
devilish good of you."
 
"Say youll help me to be good then," said I.
 
"Ecod," replied Wemmick, shaking his head, "thats not my trade."
 
"Nor is this your tradingplace," said I.
 
"You are right," he returned. "You hit the nail on the head. Mr. Pip,
Ill put on my consideringcap, and I think all you want to do may be
done by degrees. Skiffins thats her brother is an accountant and
agent. Ill look him up and go to work for you."
 
"I thank you ten thousand times."
 
"On the contrary," said he, "I thank you, for though we are strictly in
our private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there
are Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away."
 
After a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned into
the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea. The responsible
duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and that excellent
old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me in some danger
of melting his eyes. It was no nominal meal that we were going to make,
but a vigorous reality. The Aged prepared such a haystack of buttered
toast, that I could scarcely see him over it as it simmered on an iron
stand hooked on to the topbar while Miss Skiffins brewed such a jorum
of tea, that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited, and
repeatedly expressed his desire to participate in the entertainment.
 
The flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right
moment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth
as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep. Nothing disturbed
the tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of
John and Miss Skiffins which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic
infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I got used
to it. I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss Skiffinss
arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night and I rather
suspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing the profile of an
undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon, was a
piece of portable property that had been given her by Wemmick.
 
We ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it was
delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it. The Aged
especially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage
tribe, just oiled. After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffinsin the
absence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of
her family on Sunday afternoonswashed up the teathings, in a trifling
ladylike amateur manner that compromised none of us. Then, she put on
her gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, "Now,
Aged Parent, tip us the paper."
 
Wemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out, that this
was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman infinite
satisfaction to read the news aloud. "I wont offer an apology," said
Wemmick, "for he isnt capable of many pleasuresare you, Aged P.?"
 
"All right, John, all right," returned the old man, seeing himself
spoken to.
 
"Only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper,"
said Wemmick, "and hell be as happy as a king. We are all attention,
Aged One."
 
"All right, John, all right!" returned the cheerful old man, so busy and
so pleased, that it really was quite charming.
 
The Ageds reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsles
greataunts, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come
through a keyhole. As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was
always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into
them, he required as much watching as a powdermill. But Wemmick was
equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on,
quite unconscious of his many rescues. Whenever he looked at us, we
all expressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he
resumed again.
 
As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a shadowy
corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr. Wemmicks mouth,
powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round
Miss Skiffinss waist. In course of time I saw his hand appear on the
other side of Miss Skiffins but at that moment Miss Skiffins neatly
stopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm again as if it were
an article of dress, and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the
table before her. Miss Skiffinss composure while she did this was one
of the most remarkable sights I have ever seen, and if I could have
thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind, I should have
deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it mechanically.
 
By and by, I noticed Wemmicks arm beginning to disappear again, and
gradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to
widen again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite
enthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other side
of Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness
of a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid
it on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am
justified in stating that during the whole time of the Ageds reading,
Wemmicks arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to
it by Miss Skiffins.
 
At last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber. This was the time
for Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a
black bottle with a porcelaintopped cork, representing some clerical
dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect. With the aid of these
appliances we all had something warm to drink, including the Aged, who
was soon awake again. Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she and
Wemmick drank out of one glass. Of course I knew better than to offer to
see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had best
go first which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and having
passed a pleasant evening.
 
Before a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth,
stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter
appertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he would
be glad if I could come and see him again upon it. So, I went out
to Walworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him by
appointment in the City several times, but never held any communication
with him on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was,
that we found a worthy young merchant or shippingbroker, not long
established in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted
capital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner.
Between him and me, secret articles were signed of which Herbert was the
subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds down, and engaged
for sundry other payments some, to fall due at certain dates out of my
income some, contingent on my coming into my property. Miss Skiffinss
brother conducted the negotiation. Wemmick pervaded it throughout, but
never appeared in it.
 
The whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the
least suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget the radiant
face with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as a mighty
piece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker the young
merchants name, and of Clarrikers having shown an extraordinary
inclination towards him, and of his belief that the opening had come at
last. Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his face brighter, he
must have thought me a more and more affectionate friend, for I had the
greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when I saw him so
happy. At length, the thing being done, and he having that day entered
Clarrikers House, and he having talked to me for a whole evening in a
flush of pleasure and success, I did really cry in good earnest when
I went to bed, to think that my expectations had done some good to
somebody.
 
A great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my
view. But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all
the changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella. It is not
much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXXVIII
 
If that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to
be haunted when I am dead, it will be haunted, surely, by my ghost. O
the many, many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within
me haunted that house when Estella lived there! Let my body be where it
would, my spirit was always wandering, wandering, wandering, about that
house.
 
The lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was a
widow, with one daughter several years older than Estella. The mother
looked young, and the daughter looked old the mothers complexion was
pink, and the daughters was yellow the mother set up for frivolity,
and the daughter for theology. They were in what is called a good
position, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people. Little,
if any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, but the
understanding was established that they were necessary to her, and
that she was necessary to them. Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of Miss
Havishams before the time of her seclusion.
 
In Mrs. Brandleys house and out of Mrs. Brandleys house, I suffered
every kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me. The
nature of my relations with her, which placed me on terms of familiarity
without placing me on terms of favor, conduced to my distraction.
She made use of me to tease other admirers, and she turned the very
familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant
slight on my devotion to her. If I had been her secretary, steward,
halfbrother, poor relation,if I had been a younger brother of her
appointed husband,I could not have seemed to myself further from my
hopes when I was nearest to her. The privilege of calling her by her
name and hearing her call me by mine became, under the circumstances
an aggravation of my trials and while I think it likely that it almost
maddened her other lovers, I know too certainly that it almost maddened
me.
 
She had admirers without end. No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of
every one who went near her but there were more than enough of them
without that.
 
I saw her often at Richmond, I heard of her often in town, and I used
often to take her and the Brandleys on the water there were picnics,
fête days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures,
through which I pursued her,and they were all miseries to me. I never
had one hours happiness in her society, and yet my mind all round the
fourandtwenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with me
unto death.
 
Throughout this part of our intercourse,and it lasted, as will
presently be seen, for what I then thought a long time,she habitually
reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced
upon us. There were other times when she would come to a sudden check in
this tone and in all her many tones, and would seem to pity me.
 
"Pip, Pip," she said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat
apart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond "will you never
take warning?"
 
"Of what?"
 
"Of me."
 
"Warning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?"
 
"Do I mean! If you dont know what I mean, you are blind."
 
I should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for the
reason that I always was restrainedand this was not the least of my
miseriesby a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her,
when she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham. My
dread always was, that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy
disadvantage with her pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious
struggle in her bosom.
 
"At any rate," said I, "I have no warning given me just now, for you
wrote to me to come to you, this time."
 
"Thats true," said Estella, with a cold careless smile that always
chilled me.
 
After looking at the twilight without, for a little while, she went on
to say
 
"The time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day
at Satis. You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will. She
would rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid,
for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people. Can
you take me?"
 
"Can I take you, Estella!"
 
"You can then? The day after tomorrow, if you please. You are to pay
all charges out of my purse, You hear the condition of your going?"
 
"And must obey," said I.
 
This was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for others
like it Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as seen
her handwriting. We went down on the next day but one, and we found her
in the room where I had first beheld her, and it is needless to add that
there was no change in Satis House.
 
She was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when
I last saw them together I repeat the word advisedly, for there was
something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces.
She hung upon Estellas beauty, hung upon her words, hung upon her
gestures, and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked at
her, as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had reared.
 
From Estella she looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to
pry into my heart and probe its wounds. "How does she use you, Pip how
does she use you?" she asked me again, with her witchlike eagerness,
even in Estellas hearing. But, when we sat by her flickering fire
at night, she was most weird for then, keeping Estellas hand drawn
through her arm and clutched in her own hand, she extorted from her,
by dint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regular
letters, the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated
and as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mind
mortally hurt and diseased, she sat with her other hand on her crutch
stick, and her chin on that, and her wan bright eyes glaring at me, a
very spectre.
 
I saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense of
dependence and even of degradation that it awakened,I saw in this that
Estella was set to wreak Miss Havishams revenge on men, and that she
was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term. I saw
in this, a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me. Sending her
out to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her with
the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers,
and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. I saw in
this that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even while
the prize was reserved for me. I saw in this the reason for my being
staved off so long and the reason for my late guardians declining to
commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme. In a word, I
saw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and there before my eyes,
and always had had her before my eyes and I saw in this, the distinct
shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden
from the sun.
 
The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on
the wall. They were high from the ground, and they burnt with the steady
dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed. As I looked
round at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at the stopped
clock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and
the ground, and at her own awful figure with its ghostly reflection
thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I saw in
everything the construction that my mind had come to, repeated and
thrown back to me. My thoughts passed into the great room across the
landing where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as it were, in
the falls of the cobwebs from the centrepiece, in the crawlings of the
spiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice as they betook their
little quickened hearts behind the panels, and in the gropings and
pausings of the beetles on the floor.
 
It happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose
between Estella and Miss Havisham. It was the first time I had ever seen
them opposed.
 
We were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havisham
still had Estellas arm drawn through her own, and still clutched
Estellas hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself.
She had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had rather
endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.
 
"What!" said Miss Havisham, flashing her eyes upon her, "are you tired
of me?"
 
"Only a little tired of myself," replied Estella, disengaging her arm,
and moving to the great chimneypiece, where she stood looking down at
the fire.
 
"Speak the truth, you ingrate!" cried Miss Havisham, passionately
striking her stick upon the floor "you are tired of me."
 
Estella looked at her with perfect composure, and again looked down
at the fire. Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a
selfpossessed indifference to the wild heat of the other, that was
almost cruel.
 
"You stock and stone!" exclaimed Miss Havisham. "You cold, cold heart!"
 
"What?" said Estella, preserving her attitude of indifference as she
leaned against the great chimneypiece and only moving her eyes "do you
reproach me for being cold? You?"
 
"Are you not?" was the fierce retort.
 
"You should know," said Estella. "I am what you have made me. Take
all the praise, take all the blame take all the success, take all the
failure in short, take me."
 
"O, look at her, look at her!" cried Miss Havisham, bitterly "Look at
her so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she was reared! Where I
took her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its
stabs, and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her!"
 
"At least I was no party to the compact," said Estella, "for if I could
walk and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could do. But what
would you have? You have been very good to me, and I owe everything to
you. What would you have?"
 
"Love," replied the other.
 
"You have it."
 
"I have not," said Miss Havisham.
 
"Mother by adoption," retorted Estella, never departing from the easy
grace of her attitude, never raising her voice as the other did, never
yielding either to anger or tenderness,"mother by adoption, I have
said that I owe everything to you. All I possess is freely yours. All
that you have given me, is at your command to have again. Beyond that, I
have nothing. And if you ask me to give you, what you never gave me, my
gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities."
 
"Did I never give her love!" cried Miss Havisham, turning wildly to me.
"Did I never give her a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at all
times, and from sharp pain, while she speaks thus to me! Let her call me
mad, let her call me mad!"
 
"Why should I call you mad," returned Estella, "I, of all people? Does
any one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I
do? Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half
as well as I do? I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool
that is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking up
into your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!"
 
"Soon forgotten!" moaned Miss Havisham. "Times soon forgotten!"
 
"No, not forgotten," retorted Estella,"not forgotten, but treasured up
in my memory. When have you found me false to your teaching? When have
you found me unmindful of your lessons? When have you found me giving
admission here," she touched her bosom with her hand, "to anything that
you excluded? Be just to me."
 
"So proud, so proud!" moaned Miss Havisham, pushing away her gray hair
with both her hands.
 
"Who taught me to be proud?" returned Estella. "Who praised me when I
learnt my lesson?"
 
"So hard, so hard!" moaned Miss Havisham, with her former action.
 
"Who taught me to be hard?" returned Estella. "Who praised me when I
learnt my lesson?"
 
"But to be proud and hard to me!" Miss Havisham quite shrieked, as she
stretched out her arms. "Estella, Estella, Estella, to be proud and hard
to me!"
 
Estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was
not otherwise disturbed when the moment was past, she looked down at
the fire again.
 
"I cannot think," said Estella, raising her eyes after a silence "why
you should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation.
I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes. I have never been
unfaithful to you or your schooling. I have never shown any weakness
that I can charge myself with."
 
"Would it be weakness to return my love?" exclaimed Miss Havisham. "But
yes, yes, she would call it so!"
 
"I begin to think," said Estella, in a musing way, after another moment
of calm wonder, "that I almost understand how this comes about. If you
had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of
these rooms, and had never let her know that there was such a thing as
the daylight by which she had never once seen your face,if you had
done that, and then, for a purpose had wanted her to understand the
daylight and know all about it, you would have been disappointed and
angry?"
 
Miss Havisham, with her head in her hands, sat making a low moaning, and
swaying herself on her chair, but gave no answer.
 
"Or," said Estella,"which is a nearer case,if you had taught her,
from the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might,
that there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be her
enemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it had
blighted you and would else blight herif you had done this, and then,
for a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she
could not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?"
 
Miss Havisham sat listening or it seemed so, for I could not see her
face, but still made no answer.
 
"So," said Estella, "I must be taken as I have been made. The success is
not mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me."
 
Miss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor, among
the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn. I took advantage of
the momentI had sought one from the firstto leave the room, after
beseeching Estellas attention to her, with a movement of my hand. When
I left, Estella was yet standing by the great chimneypiece, just as she
had stood throughout. Miss Havishams gray hair was all adrift upon the
ground, among the other bridal wrecks, and was a miserable sight to see.
 
It was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an
hour and more, about the courtyard, and about the brewery, and about
the ruined garden. When I at last took courage to return to the room, I
found Estella sitting at Miss Havishams knee, taking up some stitches
in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, and
of which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old
banners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals. Afterwards, Estella
and I played at cards, as of yore,only we were skilful now, and played
French games,and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.
 
I lay in that separate building across the courtyard. It was the first
time I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to
come near me. A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me. She was on this side
of my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind the
halfopened door of the dressingroom, in the dressingroom, in the room
overhead, in the room beneath,everywhere. At last, when the night was
slow to creep on towards two oclock, I felt that I absolutely could no
longer bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that I must get up.
I therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out across the yard
into the long stone passage, designing to gain the outer courtyard and
walk there for the relief of my mind. But I was no sooner in the passage
than I extinguished my candle for I saw Miss Havisham going along it
in a ghostly manner, making a low cry. I followed her at a distance,
and saw her go up the staircase. She carried a bare candle in her hand,
which she had probably taken from one of the sconces in her own room,
and was a most unearthly object by its light. Standing at the bottom
of the staircase, I felt the mildewed air of the feastchamber, without
seeing her open the door, and I heard her walking there, and so across
into her own room, and so across again into that, never ceasing the low
cry. After a time, I tried in the dark both to get out, and to go back,
but I could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed
me where to lay my hands. During the whole interval, whenever I went to
the bottom of the staircase, I heard her footstep, saw her light pass
above, and heard her ceaseless low cry.
 
Before we left next day, there was no revival of the difference between
her and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion and
there were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance. Nor,
did Miss Havishams manner towards Estella in anywise change, except
that I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former
characteristics.
 
It is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting Bentley
Drummles name upon it or I would, very gladly.
 
On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, and when
good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobodys agreeing
with anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove to order,
forasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady which, according
to the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brutes turn to
do that day. I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at me while the
decanters were going round, but as there was no love lost between us,
that might easily be. What was my indignant surprise when he called upon
the company to pledge him to "Estella!"
 
"Estella who?" said I.
 
"Never you mind," retorted Drummle.
 
"Estella of where?" said I. "You are bound to say of where." Which he
was, as a Finch.
 
"Of Richmond, gentlemen," said Drummle, putting me out of the question,
"and a peerless beauty."
 
Much he knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot! I
whispered Herbert.
 
"I know that lady," said Herbert, across the table, when the toast had
been honored.
 
"Do you?" said Drummle.
 
"And so do I," I added, with a scarlet face.
 
"Do you?" said Drummle. "O, Lord!"
 
This was the only retortexcept glass or crockerythat the heavy
creature was capable of making but, I became as highly incensed by it
as if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place
and said that I could not but regard it as being like the honorable
Finchs impudence to come down to that Grove,we always talked
about coming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of
expression,down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knew
nothing. Mr. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by
that? Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew
where I was to be found.
 
Whether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood,
after this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. The debate
upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more honorable members
told six more, during the discussion, that they believed they knew where
they were to be found. However, it was decided at last the Grove being
a Court of Honor that if Mr. Drummle would bring never so slight
a certificate from the lady, importing that he had the honor of her
acquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his regret, as a gentleman and a
Finch, for "having been betrayed into a warmth which." Next day was
appointed for the production lest our honor should take cold from
delay, and next day Drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in
Estellas hand, that she had had the honor of dancing with him several
times. This left me no course but to regret that I had been "betrayed
into a warmth which," and on the whole to repudiate, as untenable, the
idea that I was to be found anywhere. Drummle and I then sat snorting
at one another for an hour, while the Grove engaged in indiscriminate
contradiction, and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to
have gone ahead at an amazing rate.
 
I tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me. For, I cannot
adequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should
show any favor to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far below
the average. To the present moment, I believe it to have been referable
to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for
her, that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to that hound.
No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she had favored but
a worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of
distress.
 
It was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummle
had begun to follow her closely, and that she allowed him to do it. A
little while, and he was always in pursuit of her, and he and I crossed
one another every day. He held on, in a dull persistent way, and Estella
held him on now with encouragement, now with discouragement, now almost
flattering him, now openly despising him, now knowing him very well, now
scarcely remembering who he was.
 
The Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him, was used to lying in wait,
however, and had the patience of his tribe. Added to that, he had a
blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness,
which sometimes did him good service,almost taking the place of
concentration and determined purpose. So, the Spider, doggedly watching
Estella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoil
himself and drop at the right nick of time.
 
At a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond there used to be Assembly Balls
at most places then, where Estella had outshone all other beauties,
this blundering Drummle so hung about her, and with so much toleration
on her part, that I resolved to speak to her concerning him. I took the
next opportunity which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Blandley to
take her home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go.
I was with her, for I almost always accompanied them to and from such
places.
 
"Are you tired, Estella?"
 
"Rather, Pip."
 
"You should be."
 
"Say rather, I should not be for I have my letter to Satis House to
write, before I go to sleep."
 
"Recounting tonights triumph?" said I. "Surely a very poor one,
Estella."
 
"What do you mean? I didnt know there had been any."
 
"Estella," said I, "do look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who is
looking over here at us."
 
"Why should I look at him?" returned Estella, with her eyes on me
instead. "What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder,to use
your words,that I need look at?"
 
"Indeed, that is the very question I want to ask you," said I. "For he
has been hovering about you all night."
 
"Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures," replied Estella, with a glance
towards him, "hover about a lighted candle. Can the candle help it?"
 
"No," I returned "but cannot the Estella help it?"
 
"Well!" said she, laughing, after a moment, "perhaps. Yes. Anything you
like."
 
"But, Estella, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you should
encourage a man so generally despised as Drummle. You know he is
despised."
 
"Well?" said she.
 
"You know he is as ungainly within as without. A deficient,
illtempered, lowering, stupid fellow."
 
"Well?" said she.
 
"You know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous
roll of addleheaded predecessors now, dont you?"
 
"Well?" said she again and each time she said it, she opened her lovely
eyes the wider.
 
To overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it
from her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, "Well! Then, that is why
it makes me wretched."
 
Now, if I could have believed that she favored Drummle with any idea of
making memewretched, I should have been in better heart about it
but in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely out of the
question, that I could believe nothing of the kind.
 
"Pip," said Estella, casting her glance over the room, "dont be foolish
about its effect on you. It may have its effect on others, and may be
meant to have. Its not worth discussing."
 
"Yes it is," said I, "because I cannot bear that people should say, she
throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest in the
crowd."
 
"I can bear it," said Estella.
 
"Oh! dont be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible."
 
"Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath!" said Estella, opening
her hands. "And in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a
boor!"
 
"There is no doubt you do," said I, something hurriedly, "for I have
seen you give him looks and smiles this very night, such as you never
give tome."
 
"Do you want me then," said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and
serious, if not angry, look, "to deceive and entrap you?"
 
"Do you deceive and entrap him, Estella?"
 
"Yes, and many others,all of them but you. Here is Mrs. Brandley. Ill
say no more."
 
 
 
And now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my
heart, and so often made it ache and ache again, I pass on unhindered,
to the event that had impended over me longer yet the event that had
begun to be prepared for, before I knew that the world held Estella,
and in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving its first
distortions from Miss Havishams wasting hands.
 
In the Eastern story, the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of
state in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry, the
tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried through
the leagues of rock, the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof,
the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of hollow to
the great iron ring. All being made ready with much labor, and the hour
come, the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night, and the sharpened
axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into his
hand, and he struck with it, and the rope parted and rushed away, and
the ceiling fell. So, in my case all the work, near and afar, that
tended to the end, had been accomplished and in an instant the blow was
struck, and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XXXIX
 
I was threeandtwenty years of age. Not another word had I heard to
enlighten me on the subject of my expectations, and my twentythird
birthday was a week gone. We had left Barnards Inn more than a year,
and lived in the Temple. Our chambers were in Gardencourt, down by the
river.
 
Mr. Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our original
relations, though we continued on the best terms. Notwithstanding my
inability to settle to anything,which I hope arose out of the restless
and incomplete tenure on which I held my means,I had a taste for
reading, and read regularly so many hours a day. That matter of
Herberts was still progressing, and everything with me was as I have
brought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter.
 
Business had taken Herbert on a journey to Marseilles. I was alone, and
had a dull sense of being alone. Dispirited and anxious, long hoping
that tomorrow or next week would clear my way, and long disappointed, I
sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend.
 
It was wretched weather stormy and wet, stormy and wet and mud, mud,
mud, deep in all the streets. Day after day, a vast heavy veil had been
driving over London from the East, and it drove still, as if in the East
there were an Eternity of cloud and wind. So furious had been the gusts,
that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs
and in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails of windmills
carried away and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast, of
shipwreck and death. Violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages
of wind, and the day just closed as I sat down to read had been the
worst of all.
 
Alterations have been made in that part of the Temple since that time,
and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then, nor is it so
exposed to the river. We lived at the top of the last house, and the
wind rushing up the river shook the house that night, like discharges
of cannon, or breakings of a sea. When the rain came with it and dashed
against the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as they
rocked, that I might have fancied myself in a stormbeaten lighthouse.
Occasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could
not bear to go out into such a night and when I set the doors open and
looked down the staircase, the staircase lamps were blown out and when
I shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows
opening them ever so little was out of the question in the teeth of
such wind and rain, I saw that the lamps in the court were blown out,
and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering, and
that the coalfires in barges on the river were being carried away
before the wind like redhot splashes in the rain.
 
I read with my watch upon the table, purposing to close my book
at eleven oclock. As I shut it, Saint Pauls, and all the many
churchclocks in the Citysome leading, some accompanying, some
followingstruck that hour. The sound was curiously flawed by the wind
and I was listening, and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it,
when I heard a footstep on the stair.
 
What nervous folly made me start, and awfully connect it with the
footstep of my dead sister, matters not. It was past in a moment, and I
listened again, and heard the footstep stumble in coming on.
Remembering then, that the staircaselights were blown out, I took up
my readinglamp and went out to the stairhead. Whoever was below had
stopped on seeing my lamp, for all was quiet.
 
"There is some one down there, is there not?" I called out, looking
down.
 
"Yes," said a voice from the darkness beneath.
 
"What floor do you want?"
 
"The top. Mr. Pip."
 
"That is my name.There is nothing the matter?"
 
"Nothing the matter," returned the voice. And the man came on.
 
I stood with my lamp held out over the stairrail, and he came slowly
within its light. It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book, and its
circle of light was very contracted so that he was in it for a mere
instant, and then out of it. In the instant, I had seen a face that was
strange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched
and pleased by the sight of me.
 
Moving the lamp as the man moved, I made out that he was substantially
dressed, but roughly, like a voyager by sea. That he had long irongray
hair. That his age was about sixty. That he was a muscular man, strong
on his legs, and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to
weather. As he ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp
included us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he was
holding out both his hands to me.
 
"Pray what is your business?" I asked him.
 
"My business?" he repeated, pausing. "Ah! Yes. I will explain my
business, by your leave."
 
"Do you wish to come in?"
 
"Yes," he replied "I wish to come in, master."
 
I had asked him the question inhospitably enough, for I resented the
sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face.
I resented it, because it seemed to imply that he expected me to respond
to it. But I took him into the room I had just left, and, having set the
lamp on the table, asked him as civilly as I could to explain himself.
 
He looked about him with the strangest air,an air of wondering
pleasure, as if he had some part in the things he admired,and he
pulled off a rough outer coat, and his hat. Then, I saw that his head
was furrowed and bald, and that the long irongray hair grew only on
its sides. But, I saw nothing that in the least explained him. On the
contrary, I saw him next moment, once more holding out both his hands to
me.
 
"What do you mean?" said I, half suspecting him to be mad.
 
He stopped in his looking at me, and slowly rubbed his right hand over
his head. "Its disapinting to a man," he said, in a coarse broken
voice, "arter having looked forard so distant, and come so fur but
youre not to blame for that,neither on us is to blame for that. Ill
speak in half a minute. Give me half a minute, please."
 
He sat down on a chair that stood before the fire, and covered his
forehead with his large brown veinous hands. I looked at him attentively
then, and recoiled a little from him but I did not know him.
 
"Theres no one nigh," said he, looking over his shoulder "is there?"
 
"Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night,
ask that question?" said I.
 
"Youre a game one," he returned, shaking his head at me with a
deliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and most exasperating
"Im glad youve growd up, a game one! But dont catch hold of me.
Youd be sorry arterwards to have done it."
 
I relinquished the intention he had detected, for I knew him! Even yet
I could not recall a single feature, but I knew him! If the wind and
the rain had driven away the intervening years, had scattered all the
intervening objects, had swept us to the churchyard where we first stood
face to face on such different levels, I could not have known my convict
more distinctly than I knew him now as he sat in the chair before the
fire. No need to take a file from his pocket and show it to me no need
to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round his head no
need to hug himself with both his arms, and take a shivering turn across
the room, looking back at me for recognition. I knew him before he gave
me one of those aids, though, a moment before, I had not been conscious
of remotely suspecting his identity.
 
He came back to where I stood, and again held out both his hands.
Not knowing what to do,for, in my astonishment I had lost my
selfpossession,I reluctantly gave him my hands. He grasped them
heartily, raised them to his lips, kissed them, and still held them.
 
"You acted noble, my boy," said he. "Noble, Pip! And I have never forgot
it!"
 
At a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me, I laid
a hand upon his breast and put him away.
 
"Stay!" said I. "Keep off! If you are grateful to me for what I did when
I was a little child, I hope you have shown your gratitude by mending
your way of life. If you have come here to thank me, it was not
necessary. Still, however you have found me out, there must be something
good in the feeling that has brought you here, and I will not repulse
you but surely you must understand thatI"
 
My attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at
me, that the words died away on my tongue.
 
"You was a saying," he observed, when we had confronted one another
in silence, "that surely I must understand. What, surely must I
understand?"
 
"That I cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long
ago, under these different circumstances. I am glad to believe you have
repented and recovered yourself. I am glad to tell you so. I am glad
that, thinking I deserve to be thanked, you have come to thank me. But
our ways are different ways, none the less. You are wet, and you look
weary. Will you drink something before you go?"
 
He had replaced his neckerchief loosely, and had stood, keenly observant
of me, biting a long end of it. "I think," he answered, still with the
end at his mouth and still observant of me, "that I will drink I thank
you afore I go."
 
There was a tray ready on a sidetable. I brought it to the table
near the fire, and asked him what he would have? He touched one of the
bottles without looking at it or speaking, and I made him some hot rum
and water. I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so, but his look
at me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his
neckerchief between his teethevidently forgottenmade my hand very
difficult to master. When at last I put the glass to him, I saw with
amazement that his eyes were full of tears.
 
Up to this time I had remained standing, not to disguise that I wished
him gone. But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man, and felt
a touch of reproach. "I hope," said I, hurriedly putting something into
a glass for myself, and drawing a chair to the table, "that you will not
think I spoke harshly to you just now. I had no intention of doing it,
and I am sorry for it if I did. I wish you well and happy!"
 
As I put my glass to my lips, he glanced with surprise at the end of his
neckerchief, dropping from his mouth when he opened it, and stretched
out his hand. I gave him mine, and then he drank, and drew his sleeve
across his eyes and forehead.
 
"How are you living?" I asked him.
 
"Ive been a sheepfarmer, stockbreeder, other trades besides, away in
the new world," said he "many a thousand mile of stormy water off from
this."
 
"I hope you have done well?"
 
"Ive done wonderfully well. Theres others went out alonger me as has
done well too, but no man has done nigh as well as me. Im famous for
it."
 
"I am glad to hear it."
 
"I hope to hear you say so, my dear boy."
 
Without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which
they were spoken, I turned off to a point that had just come into my
mind.
 
"Have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me," I inquired, "since
he undertook that trust?"
 
"Never set eyes upon him. I warnt likely to it."
 
"He came faithfully, and he brought me the two onepound notes. I was
a poor boy then, as you know, and to a poor boy they were a little
fortune. But, like you, I have done well since, and you must let me pay
them back. You can put them to some other poor boys use." I took out my
purse.
 
He watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it, and he
watched me as I separated two onepound notes from its contents. They
were clean and new, and I spread them out and handed them over to
him. Still watching me, he laid them one upon the other, folded them
longwise, gave them a twist, set fire to them at the lamp, and dropped
the ashes into the tray.
 
"May I make so bold," he said then, with a smile that was like a frown,
and with a frown that was like a smile, "as ask you how you have done
well, since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes?"
 
"How?"
 
"Ah!"
 
He emptied his glass, got up, and stood at the side of the fire, with
his heavy brown hand on the mantelshelf. He put a foot up to the bars,
to dry and warm it, and the wet boot began to steam but, he neither
looked at it, nor at the fire, but steadily looked at me. It was only
now that I began to tremble.
 
When my lips had parted, and had shaped some words that were
without sound, I forced myself to tell him though I could not do it
distinctly, that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.
 
"Might a mere warmint ask what property?" said he.
 
I faltered, "I dont know."
 
"Might a mere warmint ask whose property?" said he.
 
I faltered again, "I dont know."
 
"Could I make a guess, I wonder," said the Convict, "at your income
since you come of age! As to the first figure now. Five?"
 
With my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I rose
out of my chair, and stood with my hand upon the back of it, looking
wildly at him.
 
"Concerning a guardian," he went on. "There ought to have been some
guardian, or suchlike, whiles you was a minor. Some lawyer, maybe. As
to the first letter of that lawyers name now. Would it be J?"
 
All the truth of my position came flashing on me and its
disappointments, dangers, disgraces, consequences of all kinds, rushed
in in such a multitude that I was borne down by them and had to struggle
for every breath I drew.
 
"Put it," he resumed, "as the employer of that lawyer whose name begun
with a J, and might be Jaggers,put it as he had come over sea to
Portsmouth, and had landed there, and had wanted to come on to you.
However, you have found me out, you says just now. Well! However, did
I find you out? Why, I wrote from Portsmouth to a person in London, for
particulars of your address. That persons name? Why, Wemmick."
 
I could not have spoken one word, though it had been to save my life.
I stood, with a hand on the chairback and a hand on my breast, where
I seemed to be suffocating,I stood so, looking wildly at him, until I
grasped at the chair, when the room began to surge and turn. He caught
me, drew me to the sofa, put me up against the cushions, and bent on one
knee before me, bringing the face that I now well remembered, and that I
shuddered at, very near to mine.
 
"Yes, Pip, dear boy, Ive made a gentleman on you! Its me wot has
done it! I swore that time, sure as ever I earned a guinea, that guinea
should go to you. I swore arterwards, sure as ever I speclated and got
rich, you should get rich. I lived rough, that you should live smooth
I worked hard, that you should be above work. What odds, dear boy? Do I
tell it, fur you to feel a obligation? Not a bit. I tell it, fur you to
know as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in, got his head
so high that he could make a gentleman,and, Pip, youre him!"
 
The abhorrence in which I held the man, the dread I had of him, the
repugnance with which I shrank from him, could not have been exceeded if
he had been some terrible beast.
 
"Lookee here, Pip. Im your second father. Youre my son,more to me
nor any son. Ive put away money, only for you to spend. When I was a
hiredout shepherd in a solitary hut, not seeing no faces but faces of
sheep till I half forgot wot mens and womens faces wos like, I see
yourn. I drops my knife many a time in that hut when I was aeating my
dinner or my supper, and I says, Heres the boy again, a looking at
me whiles I eats and drinks! I see you there a many times, as plain as
ever I see you on them misty marshes. Lord strike me dead! I says each
time,and I goes out in the air to say it under the open heavens,but
wot, if I gets liberty and money, Ill make that boy a gentleman! And
I done it. Why, look at you, dear boy! Look at these here lodgings
oyourn, fit for a lord! A lord? Ah! You shall show money with lords for
wagers, and beat em!"
 
In his heat and triumph, and in his knowledge that I had been nearly
fainting, he did not remark on my reception of all this. It was the one
grain of relief I had.
 
"Lookee here!" he went on, taking my watch out of my pocket, and
turning towards him a ring on my finger, while I recoiled from his
touch as if he had been a snake, "a gold un and a beauty thats a
gentlemans, I hope! A diamond all set round with rubies thats a
gentlemans, I hope! Look at your linen fine and beautiful! Look at
your clothes better aint to be got! And your books too," turning his
eyes round the room, "mounting up, on their shelves, by hundreds! And
you read em dont you? I see youd been a reading of em when I come
in. Ha, ha, ha! You shall read em to me, dear boy! And if theyre in
foreign languages wot I dont understand, I shall be just as proud as if
I did."
 
Again he took both my hands and put them to his lips, while my blood ran
cold within me.
 
"Dont you mind talking, Pip," said he, after again drawing his sleeve
over his eyes and forehead, as the click came in his throat which I well
remembered,and he was all the more horrible to me that he was so much
in earnest "you cant do better nor keep quiet, dear boy. You aint
looked slowly forward to this as I have you wosnt prepared for this as
I wos. But didnt you never think it might be me?"
 
"O no, no, no," I returned, "Never, never!"
 
"Well, you see it wos me, and singlehanded. Never a soul in it but my
own self and Mr. Jaggers."
 
"Was there no one else?" I asked.
 
"No," said he, with a glance of surprise "who else should there be?
And, dear boy, how good looking you have growed! Theres bright eyes
somewhereseh? Isnt there bright eyes somewheres, wot you love the
thoughts on?"
 
O Estella, Estella!
 
"They shall be yourn, dear boy, if money can buy em. Not that a
gentleman like you, so well set up as you, cant win em off of his own
game but money shall back you! Let me finish wot I was a telling you,
dear boy. From that there hut and that there hiringout, I got money
left me by my master which died, and had been the same as me, and got
my liberty and went for myself. In every single thing I went for, I went
for you. Lord strike a blight upon it, I says, wotever it was I went
for, if it aint for him! It all prospered wonderful. As I giv you
to understand just now, Im famous for it. It was the money left me, and
the gains of the first few year wot I sent home to Mr. Jaggersall for
youwhen he first come arter you, agreeable to my letter."
 
O that he had never come! That he had left me at the forge,far from
contented, yet, by comparison happy!
 
"And then, dear boy, it was a recompense to me, lookee here, to know in
secret that I was making a gentleman. The blood horses of them colonists
might fling up the dust over me as I was walking what do I say? I says
to myself, Im making a better gentleman nor ever youll be! When
one of em says to another, He was a convict, a few year ago, and is a
ignorant common fellow now, for all hes lucky, what do I say? I says
to myself, If I aint a gentleman, nor yet aint got no learning, Im
the owner of such. All on you owns stock and land which on you owns a
broughtup London gentleman? This way I kep myself a going. And this
way I held steady afore my mind that I would for certain come one day
and see my boy, and make myself known to him, on his own ground."
 
He laid his hand on my shoulder. I shuddered at the thought that for
anything I knew, his hand might be stained with blood.
 
"It warnt easy, Pip, for me to leave them parts, nor yet it warnt
safe. But I held to it, and the harder it was, the stronger I held, for
I was determined, and my mind firm made up. At last I done it. Dear boy,
I done it!"
 
I tried to collect my thoughts, but I was stunned. Throughout, I had
seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him
even now, I could not separate his voice from those voices, though those
were loud and his was silent.
 
"Where will you put me?" he asked, presently. "I must be put somewheres,
dear boy."
 
"To sleep?" said I.
 
"Yes. And to sleep long and sound," he answered "for Ive been
seatossed and seawashed, months and months."
 
"My friend and companion," said I, rising from the sofa, "is absent you
must have his room."
 
"He wont come back tomorrow will he?"
 
"No," said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my utmost
efforts "not tomorrow."
 
"Because, lookee here, dear boy," he said, dropping his voice, and
laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, "caution is
necessary."
 
"How do you mean? Caution?"
 
"By G, its Death!"
 
"Whats death?"
 
"I was sent for life. Its death to come back. Theres been overmuch
coming back of late years, and I should of a certainty be hanged if
took."
 
Nothing was needed but this the wretched man, after loading wretched me
with his gold and silver chains for years, had risked his life to come
to me, and I held it there in my keeping! If I had loved him instead
of abhorring him if I had been attracted to him by the strongest
admiration and affection, instead of shrinking from him with the
strongest repugnance it could have been no worse. On the contrary, it
would have been better, for his preservation would then have naturally
and tenderly addressed my heart.
 
My first care was to close the shutters, so that no light might be seen
from without, and then to close and make fast the doors. While I did so,
he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit and when I saw
him thus engaged, I saw my convict on the marshes at his meal again. It
almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently, to file at his
leg.
 
When I had gone into Herberts room, and had shut off any other
communication between it and the staircase than through the room in
which our conversation had been held, I asked him if he would go to bed?
He said yes, but asked me for some of my "gentlemans linen" to put
on in the morning. I brought it out, and laid it ready for him, and my
blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me good
night.
 
I got away from him, without knowing how I did it, and mended the fire
in the room where we had been together, and sat down by it, afraid to go
to bed. For an hour or more, I remained too stunned to think and it
was not until I began to think, that I began fully to know how wrecked I
was, and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces.
 
Miss Havishams intentions towards me, all a mere dream Estella not
designed for me I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience, a
sting for the greedy relations, a model with a mechanical heart to
practise on when no other practice was at hand those were the first
smarts I had. But, sharpest and deepest pain of all,it was for the
convict, guilty of I knew not what crimes, and liable to be taken out
of those rooms where I sat thinking, and hanged at the Old Bailey door,
that I had deserted Joe.
 
I would not have gone back to Joe now, I would not have gone back to
Biddy now, for any consideration simply, I suppose, because my sense of
my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration.
No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that I should have
derived from their simplicity and fidelity but I could never, never,
undo what I had done.
 
In every rage of wind and rush of rain, I heard pursuers. Twice, I could
have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door. With
these fears upon me, I began either to imagine or recall that I had had
mysterious warnings of this mans approach. That, for weeks gone by, I
had passed faces in the streets which I had thought like his. That these
likenesses had grown more numerous, as he, coming over the sea, had
drawn nearer. That his wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers
to mine, and that now on this stormy night he was as good as his word,
and with me.
 
Crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seen
him with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man that I had
heard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him that
I had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild
beast. Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire a
halfformed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with
him in the dead of the wild solitary night. This dilated until it filled
the room, and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my
dreadful burden.
 
He had rolled a handkerchief round his head, and his face was set and
lowering in his sleep. But he was asleep, and quietly too, though he had
a pistol lying on the pillow. Assured of this, I softly removed the key
to the outside of his door, and turned it on him before I again sat down
by the fire. Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the floor.
When I awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of
my wretchedness, the clocks of the Eastward churches were striking five,
the candles were wasted out, the fire was dead, and the wind and rain
intensified the thick black darkness.
 
THIS IS THE END OF THE SECOND STAGE OF PIPS EXPECTATIONS.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XL
 
It was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure so far
as I could the safety of my dreaded visitor for, this thought pressing
on me when I awoke, held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a
distance.
 
The impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was
selfevident. It could not be done, and the attempt to do it would
inevitably engender suspicion. True, I had no Avenger in my service now,
but I was looked after by an inflammatory old female, assisted by an
animated ragbag whom she called her niece, and to keep a room secret
from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration. They both had
weak eyes, which I had long attributed to their chronically looking in
at keyholes, and they were always at hand when not wanted indeed that
was their only reliable quality besides larceny. Not to get up a mystery
with these people, I resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle
had unexpectedly come from the country.
 
This course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness
for the means of getting a light. Not stumbling on the means after all,
I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there to
come with his lantern. Now, in groping my way down the black staircase I
fell over something, and that something was a man crouching in a corner.
 
As the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there, but eluded
my touch in silence, I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchman to come
quickly telling him of the incident on the way back. The wind being as
fierce as ever, we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by
rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase, but we examined the
staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there. It then
occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my
rooms so, lighting my candle at the watchmans, and leaving him
standing at the door, I examined them carefully, including the room in
which my dreaded guest lay asleep. All was quiet, and assuredly no other
man was in those chambers.
 
It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, on
that night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman, on the
chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram
at the door, whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had
perceptibly been dining out? Yes, he said at different times of the
night, three. One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in
the Lane, and he had seen them all go home. Again, the only other man
who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in
the country for some weeks, and he certainly had not returned in the
night, because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came
upstairs.
 
"The night being so bad, sir," said the watchman, as he gave me back
my glass, "uncommon few have come in at my gate. Besides them three
gentlemen that I have named, I dont call to mind another since about
eleven oclock, when a stranger asked for you."
 
"My uncle," I muttered. "Yes."
 
"You saw him, sir?"
 
"Yes. Oh yes."
 
"Likewise the person with him?"
 
"Person with him!" I repeated.
 
"I judged the person to be with him," returned the watchman. "The person
stopped, when he stopped to make inquiry of me, and the person took this
way when he took this way."
 
"What sort of person?"
 
The watchman had not particularly noticed he should say a working
person to the best of his belief, he had a dustcolored kind of clothes
on, under a dark coat. The watchman made more light of the matter than I
did, and naturally not having my reason for attaching weight to it.
 
When I had got rid of him, which I thought it well to do without
prolonging explanations, my mind was much troubled by these two
circumstances taken together. Whereas they were easy of innocent
solution apart,as, for instance, some diner out or diner at home,
who had not gone near this watchmans gate, might have strayed to my
staircase and dropped asleep there,and my nameless visitor might have
brought some one with him to show him the way,still, joined, they had
an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a
few hours had made me.
 
I lighted my fire, which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the
morning, and fell into a doze before it. I seemed to have been dozing a
whole night when the clocks struck six. As there was full an hour and
a half between me and daylight, I dozed again now, waking up uneasily,
with prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears now, making thunder
of the wind in the chimney at length, falling off into a profound sleep
from which the daylight woke me with a start.
 
All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation, nor
could I do so yet. I had not the power to attend to it. I was greatly
dejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way.
As to forming any plan for the future, I could as soon have formed an
elephant. When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild
morning, all of a leaden hue when I walked from room to room when I
sat down again shivering, before the fire, waiting for my laundress to
appear I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew why, or how long
I had been so, or on what day of the week I made the reflection, or even
who I was that made it.
 
At last, the old woman and the niece came in,the latter with a head
not easily distinguishable from her dusty broom,and testified surprise
at sight of me and the fire. To whom I imparted how my uncle had come in
the night and was then asleep, and how the breakfast preparations were
to be modified accordingly. Then I washed and dressed while they knocked
the furniture about and made a dust and so, in a sort of dream
or sleepwaking, I found myself sitting by the fire again, waiting
forHimto come to breakfast.
 
By and by, his door opened and he came out. I could not bring myself to
bear the sight of him, and I thought he had a worse look by daylight.
 
"I do not even know," said I, speaking low as he took his seat at the
table, "by what name to call you. I have given out that you are my
uncle."
 
"Thats it, dear boy! Call me uncle."
 
"You assumed some name, I suppose, on board ship?"
 
"Yes, dear boy. I took the name of Provis."
 
"Do you mean to keep that name?"
 
"Why, yes, dear boy, its as good as another,unless youd like
another."
 
"What is your real name?" I asked him in a whisper.
 
"Magwitch," he answered, in the same tone "chrisend Abel."
 
"What were you brought up to be?"
 
"A warmint, dear boy."
 
He answered quite seriously, and used the word as if it denoted some
profession.
 
"When you came into the Temple last night" said I, pausing to wonder
whether that could really have been last night, which seemed so long
ago.
 
"Yes, dear boy?"
 
"When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had
you any one with you?"
 
"With me? No, dear boy."
 
"But there was some one there?"
 
"I didnt take particular notice," he said, dubiously, "not knowing the
ways of the place. But I think there was a person, too, come in alonger
me."
 
"Are you known in London?"
 
"I hope not!" said he, giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that
made me turn hot and sick.
 
"Were you known in London, once?"
 
"Not over and above, dear boy. I was in the provinces mostly."
 
"Were youtriedin London?"
 
"Which time?" said he, with a sharp look.
 
"The last time."
 
He nodded. "First knowed Mr. Jaggers that way. Jaggers was for me."
 
It was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for, but he took up
a knife, gave it a flourish, and with the words, "And what I done is
worked out and paid for!" fell to at his breakfast.
 
He ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable, and all his actions
were uncouth, noisy, and greedy. Some of his teeth had failed him since
I saw him eat on the marshes, and as he turned his food in his mouth,
and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to bear upon
it, he looked terribly like a hungry old dog. If I had begun with any
appetite, he would have taken it away, and I should have sat much as
I did,repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion, and gloomily
looking at the cloth.
 
"Im a heavy grubber, dear boy," he said, as a polite kind of apology
when he made an end of his meal, "but I always was. If it had been in
my constitution to be a lighter grubber, I might ha got into lighter
trouble. Similarly, I must have my smoke. When I was first hired out as
shepherd tother side the world, its my belief I should ha turned into
a molloncollymad sheep myself, if I hadnt a had my smoke."
 
As he said so, he got up from table, and putting his hand into the
breast of the peacoat he wore, brought out a short black pipe, and a
handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negrohead. Having
filled his pipe, he put the surplus tobacco back again, as if his pocket
were a drawer. Then, he took a live coal from the fire with the tongs,
and lighted his pipe at it, and then turned round on the hearthrug with
his back to the fire, and went through his favorite action of holding
out both his hands for mine.
 
"And this," said he, dandling my hands up and down in his, as he puffed
at his pipe,"and this is the gentleman what I made! The real genuine
One! It does me good fur to look at you, Pip. All I stiplate, is, to
stand by and look at you, dear boy!"
 
I released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was beginning
slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition. What I was
chained to, and how heavily, became intelligible to me, as I heard his
hoarse voice, and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its iron
gray hair at the sides.
 
"I mustnt see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets
there mustnt be no mud on his boots. My gentleman must have horses,
Pip! Horses to ride, and horses to drive, and horses for his servant
to ride and drive as well. Shall colonists have their horses and blood
uns, if you please, good Lord! and not my London gentleman? No, no.
Well show em another pair of shoes than that, Pip wont us?"
 
He took out of his pocket a great thick pocketbook, bursting with
papers, and tossed it on the table.
 
"Theres something worth spending in that there book, dear boy. Its
yourn. All Ive got aint mine its yourn. Dont you be afeerd on it.
Theres more where that come from. Ive come to the old country fur
to see my gentleman spend his money like a gentleman. Thatll be my
pleasure. My pleasure ull be fur to see him do it. And blast you all!"
he wound up, looking round the room and snapping his fingers once with
a loud snap, "blast you every one, from the judge in his wig, to the
colonist a stirring up the dust, Ill show a better gentleman than the
whole kit on you put together!"
 
"Stop!" said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike, "I want to speak
to you. I want to know what is to be done. I want to know how you are to
be kept out of danger, how long you are going to stay, what projects you
have."
 
"Lookee here, Pip," said he, laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly
altered and subdued manner "first of all, lookee here. I forgot myself
half a minute ago. What I said was low thats what it was low. Lookee
here, Pip. Look over it. I aint a going to be low."
 
"First," I resumed, half groaning, "what precautions can be taken
against your being recognized and seized?"
 
"No, dear boy," he said, in the same tone as before, "that dont
go first. Lowness goes first. I aint took so many year to make a
gentleman, not without knowing whats due to him. Lookee here, Pip. I
was low thats what I was low. Look over it, dear boy."
 
Some sense of the grimlyludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh, as I
replied, "I have looked over it. In Heavens name, dont harp upon it!"
 
"Yes, but lookee here," he persisted. "Dear boy, I aint come so fur,
not fur to be low. Now, go on, dear boy. You was a saying"
 
"How are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred?"
 
"Well, dear boy, the danger aint so great. Without I was informed
agen, the danger aint so much to signify. Theres Jaggers, and theres
Wemmick, and theres you. Who else is there to inform?"
 
"Is there no chance person who might identify you in the street?" said
I.
 
"Well," he returned, "there aint many. Nor yet I dont intend to
advertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A.M. come back from
Botany Bay and years have rolled away, and whos to gain by it? Still,
lookee here, Pip. If the danger had been fifty times as great, I should
ha come to see you, mind you, just the same."
 
"And how long do you remain?"
 
"How long?" said he, taking his black pipe from his mouth, and dropping
his jaw as he stared at me. "Im not a going back. Ive come for good."
 
"Where are you to live?" said I. "What is to be done with you? Where
will you be safe?"
 
"Dear boy," he returned, "theres disguising wigs can be bought
for money, and theres hair powder, and spectacles, and black
clothes,shorts and what not. Others has done it safe afore, and what
others has done afore, others can do agen. As to the where and how of
living, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it."
 
"You take it smoothly now," said I, "but you were very serious last
night, when you swore it was Death."
 
"And so I swear it is Death," said he, putting his pipe back in his
mouth, "and Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this, and
its serious that you should fully understand it to be so. What then,
when thats once done? Here I am. To go back now ud be as bad as to
stand groundworse. Besides, Pip, Im here, because Ive meant it by
you, years and years. As to what I dare, Im a old bird now, as has
dared all manner of traps since first he was fledged, and Im not afeerd
to perch upon a scarecrow. If theres Death hid inside of it, there is,
and let him come out, and Ill face him, and then Ill believe in him
and not afore. And now let me have a look at my gentleman agen."
 
Once more, he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of
admiring proprietorship smoking with great complacency all the while.
 
It appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some
quiet lodging hard by, of which he might take possession when Herbert
returned whom I expected in two or three days. That the secret must
be confided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity, even if I
could have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with
him out of the question, was plain to me. But it was by no means so
plain to Mr. Provis I resolved to call him by that name, who reserved
his consent to Herberts participation until he should have seen him
and formed a favorable judgment of his physiognomy. "And even then, dear
boy," said he, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out of
his pocket, "well have him on his oath."
 
To state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about
the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to
state what I never quite established but this I can say, that I never
knew him put it to any other use. The book itself had the appearance of
having been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps his knowledge
of its antecedents, combined with his own experience in that wise, gave
him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm. On this
first occasion of his producing it, I recalled how he had made me swear
fidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how he had described himself
last night as always swearing to his resolutions in his solitude.
 
As he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he
looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next
discussed with him what dress he should wear. He cherished an
extraordinary belief in the virtues of "shorts" as a disguise, and had
in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made
him something between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerable
difficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a
prosperous farmers and we arranged that he should cut his hair close,
and wear a little powder. Lastly, as he had not yet been seen by the
laundress or her niece, he was to keep himself out of their view until
his change of dress was made.
 
It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions but in my
dazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not
get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon. He was to
remain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no account
to open the door.
 
There being to my knowledge a respectable lodginghouse in Essex Street,
the back of which looked into the Temple, and was almost within hail of
my windows, I first of all repaired to that house, and was so fortunate
as to secure the second floor for my uncle, Mr. Provis. I then went from
shop to shop, making such purchases as were necessary to the change in
his appearance. This business transacted, I turned my face, on my own
account, to Little Britain. Mr. Jaggers was at his desk, but, seeing me
enter, got up immediately and stood before his fire.
 
"Now, Pip," said he, "be careful."
 
"I will, sir," I returned. For, coming along I had thought well of what
I was going to say.
 
"Dont commit yourself," said Mr. Jaggers, "and dont commit any one.
You understandany one. Dont tell me anything I dont want to know
anything I am not curious."
 
Of course I saw that he knew the man was come.
 
"I merely want, Mr. Jaggers," said I, "to assure myself that what I have
been told is true. I have no hope of its being untrue, but at least I
may verify it."
 
Mr. Jaggers nodded. "But did you say told or informed?" he asked
me, with his head on one side, and not looking at me, but looking in
a listening way at the floor. "Told would seem to imply verbal
communication. You cant have verbal communication with a man in New
South Wales, you know."
 
"I will say, informed, Mr. Jaggers."
 
"Good."
 
"I have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch, that he is the
benefactor so long unknown to me."
 
"That is the man," said Mr. Jaggers, "in New South Wales."
 
"And only he?" said I.
 
"And only he," said Mr. Jaggers.
 
"I am not so unreasonable, sir, as to think you at all responsible for
my mistakes and wrong conclusions but I always supposed it was Miss
Havisham."
 
"As you say, Pip," returned Mr. Jaggers, turning his eyes upon
me coolly, and taking a bite at his forefinger, "I am not at all
responsible for that."
 
"And yet it looked so like it, sir," I pleaded with a downcast heart.
 
"Not a particle of evidence, Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, shaking his head
and gathering up his skirts. "Take nothing on its looks take everything
on evidence. Theres no better rule."
 
"I have no more to say," said I, with a sigh, after standing silent for
a little while. "I have verified my information, and theres an end."
 
"And Magwitchin New South Waleshaving at last disclosed himself,"
said Mr. Jaggers, "you will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly throughout
my communication with you, I have always adhered to the strict line of
fact. There has never been the least departure from the strict line of
fact. You are quite aware of that?"
 
"Quite, sir."
 
"I communicated to Magwitchin New South Waleswhen he first wrote to
mefrom New South Walesthe caution that he must not expect me ever to
deviate from the strict line of fact. I also communicated to him another
caution. He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his letter at
some distant idea he had of seeing you in England here. I cautioned
him that I must hear no more of that that he was not at all likely to
obtain a pardon that he was expatriated for the term of his natural
life and that his presenting himself in this country would be an act of
felony, rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the law. I gave
Magwitch that caution," said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard at me "I wrote
it to New South Wales. He guided himself by it, no doubt."
 
"No doubt," said I.
 
"I have been informed by Wemmick," pursued Mr. Jaggers, still looking
hard at me, "that he has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, from
a colonist of the name of Purvis, or"
 
"Or Provis," I suggested.
 
"Or Provisthank you, Pip. Perhaps it is Provis? Perhaps you know its
Provis?"
 
"Yes," said I.
 
"You know its Provis. A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist
of the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, on
behalf of Magwitch. Wemmick sent him the particulars, I understand, by
return of post. Probably it is through Provis that you have received the
explanation of Magwitchin New South Wales?"
 
"It came through Provis," I replied.
 
"Good day, Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, offering his hand "glad to have
seen you. In writing by post to Magwitchin New South Walesor in
communicating with him through Provis, have the goodness to mention that
the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you,
together with the balance for there is still a balance remaining. Good
day, Pip!"
 
We shook hands, and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me. I
turned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the two
vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open,
and to force out of their swollen throats, "O, what a man he is!"
 
Wemmick was out, and though he had been at his desk he could have done
nothing for me. I went straight back to the Temple, where I found
the terrible Provis drinking rum and water and smoking negrohead, in
safety.
 
Next day the clothes I had ordered all came home, and he put them on.
Whatever he put on, became him less it dismally seemed to me than what
he had worn before. To my thinking, there was something in him that made
it hopeless to attempt to disguise him. The more I dressed him and the
better I dressed him, the more he looked like the slouching fugitive on
the marshes. This effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable, no
doubt, to his old face and manner growing more familiar to me but I
believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there were still a
weight of iron on it, and that from head to foot there was Convict in
the very grain of the man.
 
The influences of his solitary hutlife were upon him besides, and
gave him a savage air that no dress could tame added to these were the
influences of his subsequent branded life among men, and, crowning all,
his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now. In all his ways of
sitting and standing, and eating and drinking,of brooding about in a
highshouldered reluctant style,of taking out his great hornhandled
jackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his food,of
lifting light glasses and cups to his lips, as if they were clumsy
pannikins,of chopping a wedge off his bread, and soaking up with it
the last fragments of gravy round and round his plate, as if to make the
most of an allowance, and then drying his fingerends on it, and then
swallowing it,in these ways and a thousand other small nameless
instances arising every minute in the day, there was Prisoner, Felon,
Bondsman, plain as plain could be.
 
It had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder, and I had
conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts. But I can compare the
effect of it, when on, to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon
the dead so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it was
most desirable to repress, started through that thin layer of pretence,
and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head. It was
abandoned as soon as tried, and he wore his grizzled hair cut short.
 
Words cannot tell what a sense I had, at the same time, of the dreadful
mystery that he was to me. When he fell asleep of an evening, with his
knotted hands clenching the sides of the easychair, and his bald head
tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast, I would sit
and look at him, wondering what he had done, and loading him with all
the crimes in the Calendar, until the impulse was powerful on me to
start up and fly from him. Every hour so increased my abhorrence of
him, that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the first
agonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all he had done for me and
the risk he ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon come back.
Once, I actually did start out of bed in the night, and begin to dress
myself in my worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leave him there with
everything else I possessed, and enlist for India as a private soldier.
 
I doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in those
lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind and the
rain always rushing by. A ghost could not have been taken and hanged on
my account, and the consideration that he could be, and the dread that
he would be, were no small addition to my horrors. When he was not
asleep, or playing a complicated kind of Patience with a ragged pack of
cards of his own,a game that I never saw before or since, and in which
he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the table,when
he was not engaged in either of these pursuits, he would ask me to
read to him,"Foreign language, dear boy!" While I complied, he, not
comprehending a single word, would stand before the fire surveying me
with the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see him, between the fingers
of the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumb show to
the furniture to take notice of my proficiency. The imaginary student
pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made, was not more
wretched than I, pursued by the creature who had made me, and recoiling
from him with a stronger repulsion, the more he admired me and the
fonder he was of me.
 
This is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year. It lasted
about five days. Expecting Herbert all the time, I dared not go out,
except when I took Provis for an airing after dark. At length, one
evening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quite
worn out,for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful
dreams,I was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase. Provis,
who had been asleep too, staggered up at the noise I made, and in an
instant I saw his jackknife shining in his hand.
 
"Quiet! Its Herbert!" I said and Herbert came bursting in, with the
airy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon him.
 
"Handel, my dear fellow, how are you, and again how are you, and again
how are you? I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth! Why, so I must have
been, for you have grown quite thin and pale! Handel, myHalloa! I beg
your pardon."
 
He was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me, by
seeing Provis. Provis, regarding him with a fixed attention, was slowly
putting up his jackknife, and groping in another pocket for something
else.
 
"Herbert, my dear friend," said I, shutting the double doors, while
Herbert stood staring and wondering, "something very strange has
happened. This isa visitor of mine."
 
"Its all right, dear boy!" said Provis coming forward, with his little
clasped black book, and then addressing himself to Herbert. "Take it in
your right hand. Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in
any way sumever! Kiss it!"
 
"Do so, as he wishes it," I said to Herbert. So, Herbert, looking at
me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis
immediately shaking hands with him, said, "Now youre on your oath, you
know. And never believe me on mine, if Pip shant make a gentleman on
you!"
 
 
 
 
Chapter XLI
 
In vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet
of Herbert, when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire, and I
recounted the whole of the secret. Enough, that I saw my own feelings
reflected in Herberts face, and not least among them, my repugnance
towards the man who had done so much for me.
 
What would alone have set a division between that man and us, if there
had been no other dividing circumstance, was his triumph in my story.
Saving his troublesome sense of having been "low on one occasion since
his return,on which point he began to hold forth to Herbert, the
moment my revelation was finished,he had no perception of the
possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune. His boast that
he had made me a gentleman, and that he had come to see me support the
character on his ample resources, was made for me quite as much as for
himself. And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us,
and that we must both be very proud of it, was a conclusion quite
established in his own mind.
 
"Though, lookee here, Pips comrade," he said to Herbert, after having
discoursed for some time, "I know very well that once since I come
backfor half a minuteIve been low. I said to Pip, I knowed as I had
been low. But dont you fret yourself on that score. I aint made Pip a
gentleman, and Pip aint a going to make you a gentleman, not fur me not
to know whats due to ye both. Dear boy, and Pips comrade, you two may
count upon me always having a genteel muzzle on. Muzzled I have been
since that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness, muzzled I am
at the present time, muzzled I ever will be."
 
Herbert said, "Certainly," but looked as if there were no specific
consolation in this, and remained perplexed and dismayed. We were
anxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us
together, but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together, and sat
late. It was midnight before I took him round to Essex Street, and
saw him safely in at his own dark door. When it closed upon him, I
experienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night of
his arrival.
 
Never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs,
I had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark, and in
bringing him back and I looked about me now. Difficult as it is in a
large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when the mind is
conscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade myself that any
of the people within sight cared about my movements. The few who were
passing passed on their several ways, and the street was empty when I
turned back into the Temple. Nobody had come out at the gate with us,
nobody went in at the gate with me. As I crossed by the fountain, I saw
his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet, and, when I stood for
a few moments in the doorway of the building where I lived, before going
up the stairs, Garden Court was as still and lifeless as the staircase
was when I ascended it.
 
Herbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before so
blessedly what it is to have a friend. When he had spoken some sound
words of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider the
question, What was to be done?
 
The chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had
stood,for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot, in
one unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances with
his pipe and his negrohead and his jackknife and his pack of cards,
and what not, as if it were all put down for him on a slate,I say his
chair remaining where it had stood, Herbert unconsciously took it, but
next moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another. He had
no occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my
patron, neither had I occasion to confess my own. We interchanged that
confidence without shaping a syllable.
 
"What," said I to Herbert, when he was safe in another chair,"what is
to be done?"
 
"My poor dear Handel," he replied, holding his head, "I am too stunned
to think."
 
"So was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell. Still, something must be
done. He is intent upon various new expenses,horses, and carriages,
and lavish appearances of all kinds. He must be stopped somehow."
 
"You mean that you cant accept"
 
"How can I?" I interposed, as Herbert paused. "Think of him! Look at
him!"
 
An involuntary shudder passed over both of us.
 
"Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he is attached to
me, strongly attached to me. Was there ever such a fate!"
 
"My poor dear Handel," Herbert repeated.
 
"Then," said I, "after all, stopping short here, never taking another
penny from him, think what I owe him already! Then again I am heavily
in debt,very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,and I have
been bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing."
 
"Well, well, well!" Herbert remonstrated. "Dont say fit for nothing."
 
"What am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that
is, to go for a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but for
the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection."
 
Of course I broke down there and of course Herbert, beyond seizing a
warm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.
 
"Anyhow, my dear Handel," said he presently, "soldiering wont do. If
you were to renounce this patronage and these favors, I suppose you
would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have
already had. Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering!
Besides, its absurd. You would be infinitely better in Clarrikers
house, small as it is. I am working up towards a partnership, you know."
 
Poor fellow! He little suspected with whose money.
 
"But there is another question," said Herbert. "This is an ignorant,
determined man, who has long had one fixed idea. More than that, he
seems to me I may misjudge him to be a man of a desperate and fierce
character."
 
"I know he is," I returned. "Let me tell you what evidence I have seen
of it." And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative, of that
encounter with the other convict.
 
"See, then," said Herbert "think of this! He comes here at the peril
of his life, for the realization of his fixed idea. In the moment of
realization, after all his toil and waiting, you cut the ground from
under his feet, destroy his idea, and make his gains worthless to him.
Do you see nothing that he might do, under the disappointment?"
 
"I have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal night
of his arrival. Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his
putting himself in the way of being taken."
 
"Then you may rely upon it," said Herbert, "that there would be great
danger of his doing it. That is his power over you as long as he remains
in England, and that would be his reckless course if you forsook him."
 
I was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon
me from the first, and the working out of which would make me regard
myself, in some sort, as his murderer, that I could not rest in my
chair, but began pacing to and fro. I said to Herbert, meanwhile, that
even if Provis were recognized and taken, in spite of himself, I should
be wretched as the cause, however innocently. Yes even though I was so
wretched in having him at large and near me, and even though I would
far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I would
ever have come to this!
 
But there was no staving off the question, What was to be done?
 
"The first and the main thing to be done," said Herbert, "is to get him
out of England. You will have to go with him, and then he may be induced
to go."
 
"But get him where I will, could I prevent his coming back?"
 
"My good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next street,
there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to him and
making him reckless, here, than elsewhere. If a pretext to get him away
could be made out of that other convict, or out of anything else in his
life, now."
 
"There, again!" said I, stopping before Herbert, with my open hands held
out, as if they contained the desperation of the case. "I know nothing
of his life. It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see
him before me, so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes, and yet so
unknown to me, except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days
in my childhood!"
 
Herbert got up, and linked his arm in mine, and we slowly walked to and
fro together, studying the carpet.
 
"Handel," said Herbert, stopping, "you feel convinced that you can take
no further benefits from him do you?"
 
"Fully. Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?"
 
"And you feel convinced that you must break with him?"
 
"Herbert, can you ask me?"
 
"And you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life he
has risked on your account, that you must save him, if possible, from
throwing it away. Then you must get him out of England before you stir a
finger to extricate yourself. That done, extricate yourself, in Heavens
name, and well see it out together, dear old boy."
 
It was a comfort to shake hands upon it, and walk up and down again,
with only that done.
 
"Now, Herbert," said I, "with reference to gaining some knowledge of
his history. There is but one way that I know of. I must ask him point
blank."
 
"Yes. Ask him," said Herbert, "when we sit at breakfast in the morning."
For he had said, on taking leave of Herbert, that he would come to
breakfast with us.
 
With this project formed, we went to bed. I had the wildest dreams
concerning him, and woke unrefreshed I woke, too, to recover the fear
which I had lost in the night, of his being found out as a returned
transport. Waking, I never lost that fear.
 
He came round at the appointed time, took out his jackknife, and sat
down to his meal. He was full of plans "for his gentlemans coming out
strong, and like a gentleman," and urged me to begin speedily upon
the pocketbook which he had left in my possession. He considered the
chambers and his own lodging as temporary residences, and advised me to
look out at once for a "fashionable crib" near Hyde Park, in which he
could have "a shakedown." When he had made an end of his breakfast,
and was wiping his knife on his leg, I said to him, without a word of
preface,
 
"After you were gone last night, I told my friend of the struggle that
the soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes, when we came up. You
remember?"
 
"Remember!" said he. "I think so!"
 
"We want to know something about that manand about you. It is strange
to know no more about either, and particularly you, than I was able to
tell last night. Is not this as good a time as another for our knowing
more?"
 
"Well!" he said, after consideration. "Youre on your oath, you know,
Pips comrade?"
 
"Assuredly," replied Herbert.
 
"As to anything I say, you know," he insisted. "The oath applies to
all."
 
"I understand it to do so."
 
"And lookee here! Wotever I done is worked out and paid for," he
insisted again.
 
"So be it."
 
He took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negrohead,
when, looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand, he seemed to think
it might perplex the thread of his narrative. He put it back again,
stuck his pipe in a buttonhole of his coat, spread a hand on each knee,
and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments,
looked round at us and said what follows.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XLII
 
"Dear boy and Pips comrade. I am not a going fur to tell you my life
like a song, or a storybook. But to give it you short and handy, Ill
put it at once into a mouthful of English. In jail and out of jail, in
jail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail. There, youve got it.
Thats my life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off,
arter Pip stood my friend.
 
"Ive been done everything to, pretty wellexcept hanged. Ive been
locked up as much as a silver teakittle. Ive been carted here and
carted there, and put out of this town, and put out of that town, and
stuck in the stocks, and whipped and worried and drove. Ive no more
notion where I was born than you haveif so much. I first become aware
of myself down in Essex, a thieving turnips for my living. Summun had
run away from mea mana tinkerand hed took the fire with him, and
left me wery cold.
 
"I knowd my name to be Magwitch, chrisend Abel. How did I know
it? Much as I knowd the birds names in the hedges to be chaffinch,
sparrer, thrush. I might have thought it was all lies together, only as
the birds names come out true, I supposed mine did.
 
"So fur as I could find, there warnt a soul that see young Abel
Magwitch, with us little on him as in him, but wot caught fright at him,
and either drove him off, or took him up. I was took up, took up, took
up, to that extent that I reglarly growd up took up.
 
"This is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur as much
to be pitied as ever I see not that I looked in the glass, for there
warnt many insides of furnished houses known to me, I got the name of
being hardened. This is a terrible hardened one, they says to prison
wisitors, picking out me. May be said to live in jails, this boy. Then
they looked at me, and I looked at them, and they measured my head, some
on em,they had better a measured my stomach,and others on em giv
me tracts what I couldnt read, and made me speeches what I couldnt
understand. They always went on agen me about the Devil. But what
the Devil was I to do? I must put something into my stomach, mustnt
I?Howsomever, Im a getting low, and I know whats due. Dear boy and
Pips comrade, dont you be afeerd of me being low.
 
"Tramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I could,though
that warnt as often as you may think, till you put the question whether
you would ha been overready to give me work yourselves,a bit of a
poacher, a bit of a laborer, a bit of a wagoner, a bit of a haymaker,
a bit of a hawker, a bit of most things that dont pay and lead to
trouble, I got to be a man. A deserting soldier in a Travellers Rest,
what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs, learnt me to read
and a travelling Giant what signed his name at a penny a time learnt me
to write. I warnt locked up as often now as formerly, but I wore out my
good share of keymetal still.
 
"At Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquainted wi
a man whose skull Id crack wi this poker, like the claw of a lobster,
if Id got it on this hob. His right name was Compeyson and thats the
man, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in the ditch, according to
what you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last night.
 
"He set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and hed been to a public
boardingschool and had learning. He was a smooth one to talk, and was
a dab at the ways of gentlefolks. He was goodlooking too. It was the
night afore the great race, when I found him on the heath, in a booth
that I knowd on. Him and some more was a sitting among the tables when
I went in, and the landlord which had a knowledge of me, and was a
sporting one called him out, and said, I think this is a man that
might suit you,meaning I was.
 
"Compeyson, he looks at me very noticing, and I look at him. He has a
watch and a chain and a ring and a breastpin and a handsome suit of
clothes.
 
"To judge from appearances, youre out of luck, says Compeyson to me.
 
"Yes, master, and Ive never been in it much. I had come out of
Kingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal. Not but what it might have
been for something else but it warnt.
 
"Luck changes, says Compeyson perhaps yours is going to change.
 
"I says, I hope it may be so. Theres room.
 
"What can you do? says Compeyson.
 
"Eat and drink, I says if youll find the materials.
 
"Compeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five
shillings, and appointed me for next night. Same place.
 
"I went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on
to be his man and pardner. And what was Compeysons business in which we
was to go pardners? Compeysons business was the swindling, handwriting
forging, stolen banknote passing, and suchlike. All sorts of traps as
Compeyson could set with his head, and keep his own legs out of and get
the profits from and let another man in for, was Compeysons business.
Hed no more heart than a iron file, he was as cold as death, and he had
the head of the Devil afore mentioned.
 
"There was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur,not as
being so chrisend, but as a surname. He was in a Decline, and was a
shadow to look at. Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a
rich lady some years afore, and theyd made a pot of money by it but
Compeyson betted and gamed, and hed have run through the kings taxes.
So, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on him,
and Compeysons wife which Compeyson kicked mostly was a having pity
on him when she could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and
nobody.
 
"I might a took warning by Arthur, but I didnt and I wont pretend I
was particklerfor where ud be the good on it, dear boy and comrade?
So I begun wi Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his hands. Arthur
lived at the top of Compeysons house over nigh Brentford it was, and
Compeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging, in case
he should ever get better to work it out. But Arthur soon settled the
account. The second or third time as ever I see him, he come a tearing
down into Compeysons parlor late at night, in only a flannel gown, with
his hair all in a sweat, and he says to Compeysons wife, Sally, she
really is upstairs alonger me, now, and I cant get rid of her. Shes
all in white, he says, wi white flowers in her hair, and shes awful
mad, and shes got a shroud hanging over her arm, and she says shell
put it on me at five in the morning.
 
"Says Compeyson Why, you fool, dont you know shes got a living body?
And how should she be up there, without coming through the door, or in
at the window, and up the stairs?
 
"I dont know how shes there, says Arthur, shivering dreadful with
the horrors, but shes standing in the corner at the foot of the bed,
awful mad. And over where her hearts brokeyou broke it!theres
drops of blood.
 
"Compeyson spoke hardy, but he was always a coward. Go up alonger this
drivelling sick man, he says to his wife, and Magwitch, lend her a
hand, will you? But he never come nigh himself.
 
"Compeysons wife and me took him up to bed agen, and he raved most
dreadful. Why look at her! he cries out. Shes a shaking the shroud
at me! Dont you see her? Look at her eyes! Aint it awful to see her so
mad? Next he cries, Shell put it on me, and then Im done for! Take
it away from her, take it away! And then he catched hold of us, and kep
on a talking to her, and answering of her, till I half believed I see
her myself.
 
"Compeysons wife, being used to him, giv him some liquor to get the
horrors off, and by and by he quieted. O, shes gone! Has her keeper
been for her? he says. Yes, says Compeysons wife. Did you tell him
to lock her and bar her in? Yes. And to take that ugly thing away
from her? Yes, yes, all right. Youre a good creetur, he says,
dont leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!
 
"He rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, and
then he starts up with a scream, and screams out, Here she is! Shes
got the shroud again. Shes unfolding it. Shes coming out of the
corner. Shes coming to the bed. Hold me, both on youone of each
sidedont let her touch me with it. Hah! she missed me that time.
Dont let her throw it over my shoulders. Dont let her lift me up to
get it round me. Shes lifting me up. Keep me down! Then he lifted
himself up hard, and was dead.
 
"Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. Him and
me was soon busy, and first he swore me being ever artful on my own
book,this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade
on.
 
"Not to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I donewhich ud
take a weekIll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pips comrade, that
that man got me into such nets as made me his black slave. I was always
in debt to him, always under his thumb, always a working, always a
getting into danger. He was younger than me, but hed got craft, and
hed got learning, and he overmatched me five hundred times told and
no mercy. My Missis as I had the hard time wiStop though! I aint
brought her in"
 
He looked about him in a confused way, as if he had lost his place in
the book of his remembrance and he turned his face to the fire, and
spread his hands broader on his knees, and lifted them off and put them
on again.
 
"There aint no need to go into it," he said, looking round once more.
"The time wi Compeyson was amost as hard a time as ever I had that
said, alls said. Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for misdemeanor,
while with Compeyson?"
 
I answered, No.
 
"Well!" he said, "I was, and got convicted. As to took up on suspicion,
that was twice or three times in the four or five year that it lasted
but evidence was wanting. At last, me and Compeyson was both committed
for felony,on a charge of putting stolen notes in circulation,and
there was other charges behind. Compeyson says to me, Separate
defences, no communication, and that was all. And I was so miserable
poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on my back,
afore I could get Jaggers.
 
"When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman
Compeyson looked, wi his curly hair and his black clothes and his white
pockethandkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked. When
the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand, I
noticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him. When the
evidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had
come forard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the money
had been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing
and get the profit. But when the defence come on, then I see the plan
plainer for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, My lord and gentlemen,
here you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your eyes can
separate wide one, the younger, well brought up, who will be spoke to
as such one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to as such
one, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here transactions, and
only suspected tother, the elder, always seen in em and always wihis
guilt brought home. Can you doubt, if there is but one in it, which is
the one, and, if there is two in it, which is much the worst one? And
suchlike. And when it come to character, warnt it Compeyson as had
been to the school, and warnt it his schoolfellows as was in this
position and in that, and warnt it him as had been knowd by witnesses
in such clubs and societies, and nowt to his disadvantage? And warnt it
me as had been tried afore, and as had been knowd up hill and down dale
in Bridewells and LockUps! And when it come to speechmaking, warnt it
Compeyson as could speak to em wi his face dropping every now and then
into his white pockethandkercher,ah! and wi verses in his speech,
too,and warnt it me as could only say, Gentlemen, this man at my
side is a most precious rascal? And when the verdict come, warnt it
Compeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and
bad company, and giving up all the information he could agen me,
and warnt it me as got never a word but Guilty? And when I says to
Compeyson, Once out of this court, Ill smash that face of yourn!
aint it Compeyson as prays the Judge to be protected, and gets two
turnkeys stood betwixt us? And when were sentenced, aint it him as
gets seven year, and me fourteen, and aint it him as the Judge is
sorry for, because he might a done so well, and aint it me as the Judge
perceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion, likely to come to
worse?"
 
He had worked himself into a state of great excitement, but he checked
it, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and stretching
out his hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, "I aint a going
to be low, dear boy!"
 
He had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped his
face and head and neck and hands, before he could go on.
 
"I had said to Compeyson that Id smash that face of his, and I swore
Lord smash mine! to do it. We was in the same prisonship, but I
couldnt get at him for long, though I tried. At last I come behind him
and hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at
him, when I was seen and seized. The blackhole of that ship warnt
a strong one, to a judge of blackholes that could swim and dive. I
escaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there, envying
them as was in em and all over, when I first see my boy!"
 
He regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent
to me again, though I had felt great pity for him.
 
"By my boy, I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them marshes
too. Upon my soul, I half believe he escaped in his terror, to get quit
of me, not knowing it was me as had got ashore. I hunted him down. I
smashed his face. And now, says I as the worst thing I can do, caring
nothing for myself, Ill drag you back. And Id have swum off, towing
him by the hair, if it had come to that, and Id a got him aboard
without the soldiers.
 
"Of course hed much the best of it to the last,his character was so
good. He had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous
intentions and his punishment was light. I was put in irons, brought
to trial again, and sent for life. I didnt stop for life, dear boy and
Pips comrade, being here."
 
"He wiped himself again, as he had done before, and then slowly took
his tangle of tobacco from his pocket, and plucked his pipe from his
buttonhole, and slowly filled it, and began to smoke.
 
"Is he dead?" I asked, after a silence.
 
"Is who dead, dear boy?"
 
"Compeyson."
 
"He hopes I am, if hes alive, you may be sure," with a fierce look. "I
never heerd no more of him."
 
Herbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book. He
softly pushed the book over to me, as Provis stood smoking with his eyes
on the fire, and I read in it
 
"Young Havishams name was Arthur. Compeyson is the man who professed to
be Miss Havishams lover."
 
I shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert, and put the book by but
we neither of us said anything, and both looked at Provis as he stood
smoking by the fire.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XLIII
 
Why should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis might be
traced to Estella? Why should I loiter on my road, to compare the state
of mind in which I had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison
before meeting her at the coachoffice, with the state of mind in which
I now reflected on the abyss between Estella in her pride and beauty,
and the returned transport whom I harbored? The road would be none the
smoother for it, the end would be none the better for it, he would not
be helped, nor I extenuated.
 
A new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative or rather,
his narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already
there. If Compeyson were alive and should discover his return, I could
hardly doubt the consequence. That Compeyson stood in mortal fear of
him, neither of the two could know much better than I and that any
such man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release
himself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an
informer was scarcely to be imagined.
 
Never had I breathed, and never would I breatheor so I resolveda
word of Estella to Provis. But, I said to Herbert that, before I could
go abroad, I must see both Estella and Miss Havisham. This was when we
were left alone on the night of the day when Provis told us his story. I
resolved to go out to Richmond next day, and I went.
 
On my presenting myself at Mrs. Brandleys, Estellas maid was called to
tell that Estella had gone into the country. Where? To Satis House, as
usual. Not as usual, I said, for she had never yet gone there without
me when was she coming back? There was an air of reservation in the
answer which increased my perplexity, and the answer was, that her maid
believed she was only coming back at all for a little while. I could
make nothing of this, except that it was meant that I should make
nothing of it, and I went home again in complete discomfiture.
 
Another night consultation with Herbert after Provis was gone home I
always took him home, and always looked well about me, led us to the
conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came
back from Miss Havishams. In the mean time, Herbert and I were to
consider separately what it would be best to say whether we should
devise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious
observation or whether I, who had never yet been abroad, should propose
an expedition. We both knew that I had but to propose anything, and he
would consent. We agreed that his remaining many days in his present
hazard was not to be thought of.
 
Next day I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promise
to go down to Joe but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Joe
or his name. Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone, and
Herbert was to take the charge of him that I had taken. I was to be
absent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of his
impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to
be begun. It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to
Herbert also, that he might be best got away across the water, on that
pretence,as, to make purchases, or the like.
 
Having thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havishams, I set
off by the early morning coach before it was yet light, and was out
on the open country road when the day came creeping on, halting and
whimpering and shivering, and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of
mist, like a beggar. When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzly
ride, whom should I see come out under the gateway, toothpick in hand,
to look at the coach, but Bentley Drummle!
 
As he pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him. It was a very
lame pretence on both sides the lamer, because we both went into the
coffeeroom, where he had just finished his breakfast, and where I
ordered mine. It was poisonous to me to see him in the town, for I very
well knew why he had come there.
 
Pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which had
nothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of
coffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine with which
it was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a highly
irregular form, I sat at my table while he stood before the fire. By
degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the
fire. And I got up, determined to have my share of it. I had to put my
hand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to
stir the fire, but still pretended not to know him.
 
"Is this a cut?" said Mr. Drummle.
 
"Oh!" said I, poker in hand "its you, is it? How do you do? I was
wondering who it was, who kept the fire off."
 
With that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myself side
by side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to the fire.
 
"You have just come down?" said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little away
with his shoulder.
 
"Yes," said I, edging him a little away with my shoulder.
 
"Beastly place," said Drummle. "Your part of the country, I think?"
 
"Yes," I assented. "I am told its very like your Shropshire."
 
"Not in the least like it," said Drummle.
 
Here Mr. Drummle looked at his boots and I looked at mine, and then Mr.
Drummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his.
 
"Have you been here long?" I asked, determined not to yield an inch of
the fire.
 
"Long enough to be tired of it," returned Drummle, pretending to yawn,
but equally determined.
 
"Do you stay here long?"
 
"Cant say," answered Mr. Drummle. "Do you?"
 
"Cant say," said I.
 
I felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummles
shoulder had claimed another hairs breadth of room, I should have
jerked him into the window equally, that if my own shoulder had urged a
similar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box. He
whistled a little. So did I.
 
"Large tract of marshes about here, I believe?" said Drummle.
 
"Yes. What of that?" said I.
 
Mr. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said, "Oh!" and
laughed.
 
"Are you amused, Mr. Drummle?"
 
"No," said he, "not particularly. I am going out for a ride in the
saddle. I mean to explore those marshes for amusement. Outoftheway
villages there, they tell me. Curious little publichousesand
smithiesand that. Waiter!"
 
"Yes, sir."
 
"Is that horse of mine ready?"
 
"Brought round to the door, sir."
 
"I say. Look here, you sir. The lady wont ride today the weather
wont do."
 
"Very good, sir."
 
"And I dont dine, because Im going to dine at the ladys."
 
"Very good, sir."
 
Then, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on his
greatjowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he was, and so
exasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him in my arms as the
robber in the storybook is said to have taken the old lady and seat
him on the fire.
 
One thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief
came, neither of us could relinquish the fire. There we stood, well
squared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with our
hands behind us, not budging an inch. The horse was visible outside in
the drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummles
was cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we both
stood our ground.
 
"Have you been to the Grove since?" said Drummle.
 
"No," said I, "I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was
there."
 
"Was that when we had a difference of opinion?"
 
"Yes," I replied, very shortly.
 
"Come, come! They let you off easily enough," sneered Drummle. "You
shouldnt have lost your temper."
 
"Mr. Drummle," said I, "you are not competent to give advice on that
subject. When I lose my temper not that I admit having done so on that
occasion, I dont throw glasses."
 
"I do," said Drummle.
 
After glancing at him once or twice, in an increased state of
smouldering ferocity, I said,
 
"Mr. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I dont think it an
agreeable one."
 
"I am sure its not," said he, superciliously over his shoulder "I
dont think anything about it."
 
"And therefore," I went on, "with your leave, I will suggest that we
hold no kind of communication in future."
 
"Quite my opinion," said Drummle, "and what I should have suggested
myself, or donemore likelywithout suggesting. But dont lose your
temper. Havent you lost enough without that?"
 
"What do you mean, sir?"
 
"Waiter!" said Drummle, by way of answering me.
 
The waiter reappeared.
 
"Look here, you sir. You quite understand that the young lady dont ride
today, and that I dine at the young ladys?"
 
"Quite so, sir!"
 
When the waiter had felt my fastcooling teapot with the palm of his
hand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle,
careful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his pocket
and bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring. Choking and
boiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, without
introducing Estellas name, which I could not endure to hear him utter
and therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there were
no one present, and forced myself to silence. How long we might have
remained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but
for the incursion of three thriving farmerslaid on by the waiter, I
thinkwho came into the coffeeroom unbuttoning their greatcoats and
rubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, we
were obliged to give way.
 
I saw him through the window, seizing his horses mane, and mounting in
his blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away. I thought
he was gone, when he came back, calling for a light for the cigar in his
mouth, which he had forgotten. A man in a dustcolored dress appeared
with what was wanted,I could not have said from where whether from
the inn yard, or the street, or where not,and as Drummle leaned down
from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed, with a jerk of his
head towards the coffeeroom windows, the slouching shoulders and ragged
hair of this man whose back was towards me reminded me of Orlick.
 
Too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or
no, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and the
journey from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old house
that it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered,
never to have seen.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XLIV
 
In the room where the dressingtable stood, and where the waxcandles
burnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella Miss Havisham
seated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a cushion at her feet.
Estella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on. They both raised
their eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me. I derived
that, from the look they interchanged.
 
"And what wind," said Miss Havisham, "blows you here, Pip?"
 
Though she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused.
Estella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me, and
then going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers, as
plainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she perceived I
had discovered my real benefactor.
 
"Miss Havisham," said I, "I went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to
Estella and finding that some wind had blown her here, I followed."
 
Miss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down,
I took the chair by the dressingtable, which I had often seen her
occupy. With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural
place for me, that day.
 
"What I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before you,
presentlyin a few moments. It will not surprise you, it will not
displease you. I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be."
 
Miss Havisham continued to look steadily at me. I could see in the
action of Estellas fingers as they worked that she attended to what I
said but she did not look up.
 
"I have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate discovery,
and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune,
anything. There are reasons why I must say no more of that. It is not my
secret, but anothers."
 
As I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering how to
go on, Miss Havisham repeated, "It is not your secret, but anothers.
Well?"
 
"When you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham, when I
belonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left,
I suppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might have
come,as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paid
for it?"
 
"Ay, Pip," replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head "you did."
 
"And that Mr. Jaggers"
 
"Mr. Jaggers," said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, "had
nothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it. His being my lawyer, and
his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence. He holds the same
relation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise. Be that
as it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one."
 
Any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no
suppression or evasion so far.
 
"But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least
you led me on?" said I.
 
"Yes," she returned, again nodding steadily, "I let you go on."
 
"Was that kind?"
 
"Who am I," cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the floor
and flashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in
surprise,"who am I, for Gods sake, that I should be kind?"
 
It was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it. I
told her so, as she sat brooding after this outburst.
 
"Well, well, well!" she said. "What else?"
 
"I was liberally paid for my old attendance here," I said, to soothe
her, "in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only for
my own information. What follows has another and I hope more
disinterested purpose. In humoring my mistake, Miss Havisham, you
punishedpractised onperhaps you will supply whatever term expresses
your intention, without offenceyour selfseeking relations?"
 
"I did. Why, they would have it so! So would you. What has been my
history, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you
not to have it so! You made your own snares. I never made them."
 
Waiting until she was quiet again,for this, too, flashed out of her in
a wild and sudden way,I went on.
 
"I have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss Havisham,
and have been constantly among them since I went to London. I know them
to have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself. And I should be
false and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to you or
no, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, that you
deeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert, if you suppose
them to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, and incapable of
anything designing or mean."
 
"They are your friends," said Miss Havisham.
 
"They made themselves my friends," said I, "when they supposed me
to have superseded them and when Sarah Pocket, Miss Georgiana, and
Mistress Camilla were not my friends, I think."
 
This contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to do
them good with her. She looked at me keenly for a little while, and then
said quietly,
 
"What do you want for them?"
 
"Only," said I, "that you would not confound them with the others. They
may be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the same
nature."
 
Still looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated,
 
"What do you want for them?"
 
"I am not so cunning, you see," I said, in answer, conscious that I
reddened a little, "as that I could hide from you, even if I desired,
that I do want something. Miss Havisham, if you would spare the money
to do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which from the
nature of the case must be done without his knowledge, I could show you
how."
 
"Why must it be done without his knowledge?" she asked, settling her
hands upon her stick, that she might regard me the more attentively.
 
"Because," said I, "I began the service myself, more than two years ago,
without his knowledge, and I dont want to be betrayed. Why I fail in my
ability to finish it, I cannot explain. It is a part of the secret which
is another persons and not mine."
 
She gradually withdrew her eyes from me, and turned them on the fire.
After watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light
of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused by
the collapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me againat
first, vacantlythen, with a gradually concentrating attention. All
this time Estella knitted on. When Miss Havisham had fixed her
attention on me, she said, speaking as if there had been no lapse in our
dialogue,
 
"What else?"
 
"Estella," said I, turning to her now, and trying to command my
trembling voice, "you know I love you. You know that I have loved you
long and dearly."
 
She raised her eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and her fingers
plied their work, and she looked at me with an unmoved countenance. I
saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, and from her to me.
 
"I should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It induced me
to hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another. While I thought you
could not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it. But I
must say it now."
 
Preserving her unmoved countenance, and with her fingers still going,
Estella shook her head.
 
"I know," said I, in answer to that action,"I know. I have no hope
that I shall ever call you mine, Estella. I am ignorant what may become
of me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still, I love
you. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house."
 
Looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she shook her
head again.
 
"It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practise
on the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through all these
years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she had reflected on the
gravity of what she did. But I think she did not. I think that, in the
endurance of her own trial, she forgot mine, Estella."
 
I saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there, as she
sat looking by turns at Estella and at me.
 
"It seems," said Estella, very calmly, "that there are sentiments,
fancies,I dont know how to call them,which I am not able to
comprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form
of words but nothing more. You address nothing in my breast, you touch
nothing there. I dont care for what you say at all. I have tried to
warn you of this now, have I not?"
 
I said in a miserable manner, "Yes."
 
"Yes. But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.
Now, did you not think so?"
 
"I thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young, untried, and
beautiful, Estella! Surely it is not in Nature."
 
"It is in my nature," she returned. And then she added, with a stress
upon the words, "It is in the nature formed within me. I make a great
difference between you and all other people when I say so much. I can do
no more."
 
"Is it not true," said I, "that Bentley Drummle is in town here, and
pursuing you?"
 
"It is quite true," she replied, referring to him with the indifference
of utter contempt.
 
"That you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he dines with
you this very day?"
 
She seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied,
"Quite true."
 
"You cannot love him, Estella!"
 
Her fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather angrily,
"What have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, that I do not
mean what I say?"
 
"You would never marry him, Estella?"
 
She looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her
work in her hands. Then she said, "Why not tell you the truth? I am
going to be married to him."
 
I dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better
than I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear
her say those words. When I raised my face again, there was such a
ghastly look upon Miss Havishams, that it impressed me, even in my
passionate hurry and grief.
 
"Estella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this
fatal step. Put me aside for ever,you have done so, I well know,but
bestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Miss Havisham
gives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be done
to the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly
love you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly,
though he has not loved you as long, as I. Take him, and I can bear it
better, for your sake!"
 
My earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have
been touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at all
intelligible to her own mind.
 
"I am going," she said again, in a gentler voice, "to be married to
him. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be
married soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by
adoption? It is my own act."
 
"Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?"
 
"On whom should I fling myself away?" she retorted, with a smile.
"Should I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel if
people do feel such things that I took nothing to him? There! It is
done. I shall do well enough, and so will my husband. As to leading
me into what you call this fatal step, Miss Havisham would have had me
wait, and not marry yet but I am tired of the life I have led, which
has very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it. Say no
more. We shall never understand each other."
 
"Such a mean brute, such a stupid brute!" I urged, in despair.
 
"Dont be afraid of my being a blessing to him," said Estella "I shall
not be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, you visionary
boyor man?"
 
"O Estella!" I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand, do
what I would to restrain them "even if I remained in England and could
hold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummles wife?"
 
"Nonsense," she returned,"nonsense. This will pass in no time."
 
"Never, Estella!"
 
"You will get me out of your thoughts in a week."
 
"Out of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself. You
have been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the
rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been
in every prospect I have ever seen since,on the river, on the sails of
the ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the darkness,
in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You have been
the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become
acquainted with. The stones of which the strongest London buildings
are made are not more real, or more impossible to be displaced by your
hands, than your presence and influence have been to me, there and
everywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last hour of my life, you
cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the little good
in me, part of the evil. But, in this separation, I associate you only
with the good and I will faithfully hold you to that always, for you
must have done me far more good than harm, let me feel now what sharp
distress I may. O God bless you, God forgive you!"
 
In what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself, I
dont know. The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood from an
inward wound, and gushed out. I held her hand to my lips some lingering
moments, and so I left her. But ever afterwards, I remembered,and soon
afterwards with stronger reason,that while Estella looked at me merely
with incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her hand
still covering her heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of
pity and remorse.
 
All done, all gone! So much was done and gone, that when I went out at
the gate, the light of the day seemed of a darker color than when I went
in. For a while, I hid myself among some lanes and bypaths, and then
struck off to walk all the way to London. For, I had by that time come
to myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to the inn and
see Drummle there that I could not bear to sit upon the coach and
be spoken to that I could do nothing half so good for myself as tire
myself out.
 
It was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge. Pursuing the narrow
intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the
Middlesex shore of the river, my readiest access to the Temple was
close by the riverside, through Whitefriars. I was not expected till
tomorrow but I had my keys, and, if Herbert were gone to bed, could
get to bed myself without disturbing him.
 
As it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after the
Temple was closed, and as I was very muddy and weary, I did not take it
ill that the nightporter examined me with much attention as he held the
gate a little way open for me to pass in. To help his memory I mentioned
my name.
 
"I was not quite sure, sir, but I thought so. Heres a note, sir. The
messenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my
lantern?"
 
Much surprised by the request, I took the note. It was directed to
Philip Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were the
words, "PLEASE READ THIS, HERE." I opened it, the watchman holding up
his light, and read inside, in Wemmicks writing,
 
"DONT GO HOME."
 
 
 
 
Chapter XLV
 
Turning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, I made
the best of my way to Fleet Street, and there got a late hackney chariot
and drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden. In those times a bed was
always to be got there at any hour of the night, and the chamberlain,
letting me in at his ready wicket, lighted the candle next in order on
his shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his
list. It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back, with a
despotic monster of a fourpost bedstead in it, straddling over the
whole place, putting one of his arbitrary legs into the fireplace
and another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretched little
washingstand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner.
 
As I had asked for a nightlight, the chamberlain had brought me in,
before he left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of those
virtuous days.an object like the ghost of a walkingcane, which
instantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever be
lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom
of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a staringly
wideawake pattern on the walls. When I had got into bed, and lay there
footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more close my own
eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus. And thus, in the
gloom and death of the night, we stared at one another.
 
What a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There was an
inhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust and, as I
looked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what
a number of bluebottle flies from the butchers, and earwigs from the
market, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying
by for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them ever
tumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,a
disagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable
approaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those
extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves
audible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little
washingstand ticked, and one guitarstring played occasionally in the
chest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired
a new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw
written, DONT GO HOME.
 
Whatever nightfancies and nightnoises crowded on me, they never warded
off this DONT GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever I thought of,
as a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I had read in the
newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums in the
night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had been
found in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head that he
must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to
assure myself that there were no red marks about then opened the door
to look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship
of a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But
all this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,
and when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were
questions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed
there could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when I
thought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when
I recalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks and
tones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,even then I
was pursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Dont go home.
When at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became
a vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, present
tense Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us not go home, do
not ye or you go home, let not them go home. Then potentially I may not
and I cannot go home and I might not, could not, would not, and should
not go home until I felt that I was going distracted, and rolled over
on the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again.
 
I had left directions that I was to be called at seven for it was plain
that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally plain
that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments only could be
taken. It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been
so miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the door to startle me
from my uneasy bed.
 
The Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight oclock. The little
servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls, I
passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company,
and so came without announcement into the presence of Wemmick as he was
making tea for himself and the Aged. An open door afforded a perspective
view of the Aged in bed.
 
"Halloa, Mr. Pip!" said Wemmick. "You did come home, then?"
 
"Yes," I returned "but I didnt go home."
 
"Thats all right," said he, rubbing his hands. "I left a note for you
at each of the Temple gates, on the chance. Which gate did you come to?"
 
I told him.
 
"Ill go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the
notes," said Wemmick "its a good rule never to leave documentary
evidence if you can help it, because you dont know when it may be put
in. Im going to take a liberty with you. Would you mind toasting this
sausage for the Aged P.?"
 
I said I should be delighted to do it.
 
"Then you can go about your work, Mary Anne," said Wemmick to the little
servant "which leaves us to ourselves, dont you see, Mr. Pip?" he
added, winking, as she disappeared.
 
I thanked him for his friendship and caution, and our discourse
proceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Ageds sausage and he
buttered the crumb of the Ageds roll.
 
"Now, Mr. Pip, you know," said Wemmick, "you and I understand one
another. We are in our private and personal capacities, and we have been
engaged in a confidential transaction before today. Official sentiments
are one thing. We are extra official."
 
I cordially assented. I was so very nervous, that I had already lighted
the Ageds sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out.
 
"I accidentally heard, yesterday morning," said Wemmick, "being in a
certain place where I once took you,even between you and me, its as
well not to mention names when avoidable"
 
"Much better not," said I. "I understand you."
 
"I heard there by chance, yesterday morning," said Wemmick, "that
a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not
unpossessed of portable property,I dont know who it may really
be,we wont name this person"
 
"Not necessary," said I.
 
"Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good
many people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations,
and not quite irrespective of the government expense"
 
In watching his face, I made quite a firework of the Ageds sausage,
and greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmicks for which I
apologized.
 
"By disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of
thereabouts. From which," said Wemmick, "conjectures had been raised and
theories formed. I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden Court,
Temple, had been watched, and might be watched again."
 
"By whom?" said I.
 
"I wouldnt go into that," said Wemmick, evasively, "it might clash with
official responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time heard other
curious things in the same place. I dont tell it you on information
received. I heard it."
 
He took the toastingfork and sausage from me as he spoke, and set forth
the Ageds breakfast neatly on a little tray. Previous to placing it
before him, he went into the Ageds room with a clean white cloth, and
tied the same under the old gentlemans chin, and propped him up, and
put his nightcap on one side, and gave him quite a rakish air. Then he
placed his breakfast before him with great care, and said, "All right,
aint you, Aged P.?" To which the cheerful Aged replied, "All right,
John, my boy, all right!" As there seemed to be a tacit understanding
that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was therefore to be
considered invisible, I made a pretence of being in complete ignorance
of these proceedings.
 
"This watching of me at my chambers which I have once had reason to
suspect," I said to Wemmick when he came back, "is inseparable from the
person to whom you have adverted is it?"
 
Wemmick looked very serious. "I couldnt undertake to say that, of my
own knowledge. I mean, I couldnt undertake to say it was at first. But
it either is, or it will be, or its in great danger of being."
 
As I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying
as much as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far out
of his way he went to say what he did, I could not press him. But I told
him, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to ask
him a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as he
deemed right, and sure that his course would be right. He paused in his
breakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirtsleeves his
notion of indoor comfort was to sit without any coat, he nodded to me
once, to put my question.
 
"You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is
Compeyson?"
 
He answered with one other nod.
 
"Is he living?"
 
One other nod.
 
"Is he in London?"
 
He gave me one other nod, compressed the postoffice exceedingly, gave
me one last nod, and went on with his breakfast.
 
"Now," said Wemmick, "questioning being over," which he emphasized and
repeated for my guidance, "I come to what I did, after hearing what I
heard. I went to Garden Court to find you not finding you, I went to
Clarrikers to find Mr. Herbert."
 
"And him you found?" said I, with great anxiety.
 
"And him I found. Without mentioning any names or going into any
details, I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybodyTom,
Jack, or Richardbeing about the chambers, or about the immediate
neighborhood, he had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the way
while you were out of the way."
 
"He would be greatly puzzled what to do?"
 
"He was puzzled what to do not the less, because I gave him my opinion
that it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard too far out
of the way at present. Mr. Pip, Ill tell you something. Under existing
circumstances, there is no place like a great city when you are once
in it. Dont break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till things slacken,
before you try the open, even for foreign air."
 
I thanked him for his valuable advice, and asked him what Herbert had
done?
 
"Mr. Herbert," said Wemmick, "after being all of a heap for half an
hour, struck out a plan. He mentioned to me as a secret, that he is
courting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden
Pa. Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies abed in a
bowwindow where he can see the ships sail up and down the river. You
are acquainted with the young lady, most probably?"
 
"Not personally," said I.
 
The truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companion
who did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed to
present me to her, she had received the proposal with such very moderate
warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the state of
the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time before I made
her acquaintance. When I had begun to advance Herberts prospects by
stealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy he and
his affianced, for their part, had naturally not been very anxious to
introduce a third person into their interviews and thus, although I was
assured that I had risen in Claras esteem, and although the young
lady and I had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by
Herbert, I had never seen her. However, I did not trouble Wemmick with
these particulars.
 
"The house with the bowwindow," said Wemmick, "being by the riverside,
down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and being kept, it
seems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to
let, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that as a temporary
tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard? Now, I thought very well of it, for
three reasons Ill give you. That is to say Firstly. Its altogether
out of all your beats, and is well away from the usual heap of streets
great and small. Secondly. Without going near it yourself, you could
always hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard, through Mr. Herbert.
Thirdly. After a while and when it might be prudent, if you should want
to slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board a foreign packetboat, there he
isready."
 
Much comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and
again, and begged him to proceed.
 
"Well, sir! Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will, and
by nine oclock last night he housed Tom, Jack, or Richard,whichever
it may be,you and I dont want to know,quite successfully. At the
old lodgings it was understood that he was summoned to Dover, and, in
fact, he was taken down the Dover road and cornered out of it. Now,
another great advantage of all this is, that it was done without you,
and when, if any one was concerning himself about your movements, you
must be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged.
This diverts suspicion and confuses it and for the same reason I
recommended that, even if you came back last night, you should not go
home. It brings in more confusion, and you want confusion."
 
Wemmick, having finished his breakfast, here looked at his watch, and
began to get his coat on.
 
"And now, Mr. Pip," said he, with his hands still in the sleeves, "I
have probably done the most I can do but if I can ever do more,from
a Walworth point of view, and in a strictly private and personal
capacity,I shall be glad to do it. Heres the address. There can be
no harm in your going here tonight, and seeing for yourself that all is
well with Tom, Jack, or Richard, before you go home,which is another
reason for your not going home last night. But, after you have gone
home, dont go back here. You are very welcome, I am sure, Mr. Pip" his
hands were now out of his sleeves, and I was shaking them "and let me
finally impress one important point upon you." He laid his hands upon
my shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper "Avail yourself of this
evening to lay hold of his portable property. You dont know what may
happen to him. Dont let anything happen to the portable property."
 
Quite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point, I
forbore to try.
 
"Times up," said Wemmick, "and I must be off. If you had nothing more
pressing to do than to keep here till dark, thats what I should advise.
You look very much worried, and it would do you good to have a perfectly
quiet day with the Aged,hell be up presently,and a little bit
ofyou remember the pig?"
 
"Of course," said I.
 
"Well and a little bit of him. That sausage you toasted was his, and
he was in all respects a firstrater. Do try him, if it is only for old
acquaintance sake. Good by, Aged Parent!" in a cheery shout.
 
"All right, John all right, my boy!" piped the old man from within.
 
I soon fell asleep before Wemmicks fire, and the Aged and I enjoyed one
anothers society by falling asleep before it more or less all day.
We had loin of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the estate and
I nodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I failed to do it
drowsily. When it was quite dark, I left the Aged preparing the fire for
toast and I inferred from the number of teacups, as well as from his
glances at the two little doors in the wall, that Miss Skiffins was
expected.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XLVI
 
Eight oclock had struck before I got into the air, that was scented,
not disagreeably, by the chips and shavings of the longshore
boatbuilders, and mast, oar, and block makers. All that waterside
region of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge was unknown ground to
me and when I struck down by the river, I found that the spot I wanted
was not where I had supposed it to be, and was anything but easy to
find. It was called Mill Pond Bank, Chinkss Basin and I had no other
guide to Chinkss Basin than the Old Green Copper Ropewalk.
 
It matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost myself
among, what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces,
what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide, what yards of shipbuilders
and shipbreakers, what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground,
though for years off duty, what mountainous country of accumulated casks
and timber, how many ropewalks that were not the Old Green Copper. After
several times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting
it, I came unexpectedly round a corner, upon Mill Pond Bank. It was a
fresh kind of place, all circumstances considered, where the wind from
the river had room to turn itself round and there were two or three
trees in it, and there was the stump of a ruined windmill, and there
was the Old Green Copper Ropewalk,whose long and narrow vista I could
trace in the moonlight, along a series of wooden frames set in the
ground, that looked like superannuated haymakingrakes which had grown
old and lost most of their teeth.
 
Selecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank a house with a
wooden front and three stories of bowwindow not baywindow, which is
another thing, I looked at the plate upon the door, and read there,
Mrs. Whimple. That being the name I wanted, I knocked, and an elderly
woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded. She was
immediately deposed, however, by Herbert, who silently led me into
the parlor and shut the door. It was an odd sensation to see his very
familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room
and region and I found myself looking at him, much as I looked at
the cornercupboard with the glass and china, the shells upon the
chimneypiece, and the colored engravings on the wall, representing the
death of Captain Cook, a shiplaunch, and his Majesty King George the
Third in a state coachmans wig, leatherbreeches, and topboots, on the
terrace at Windsor.
 
"All is well, Handel," said Herbert, "and he is quite satisfied, though
eager to see you. My dear girl is with her father and if youll wait
till she comes down, Ill make you known to her, and then well go up
stairs. Thats her father."
 
I had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had probably
expressed the fact in my countenance.
 
"I am afraid he is a sad old rascal," said Herbert, smiling, "but I have
never seen him. Dont you smell rum? He is always at it."
 
"At rum?" said I.
 
"Yes," returned Herbert, "and you may suppose how mild it makes his
gout. He persists, too, in keeping all the provisions up stairs in his
room, and serving them out. He keeps them on shelves over his head, and
will weigh them all. His room must be like a chandlers shop."
 
While he thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, and
then died away.
 
"What else can be the consequence," said Herbert, in explanation, "if
he will cut the cheese? A man with the gout in his right handand
everywhere elsecant expect to get through a Double Gloucester without
hurting himself."
 
He seemed to have hurt himself very much, for he gave another furious
roar.
 
"To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs. Whimple,"
said Herbert, "for of course people in general wont stand that noise. A
curious place, Handel isnt it?"
 
It was a curious place, indeed but remarkably well kept and clean.
 
"Mrs. Whimple," said Herbert, when I told him so, "is the best of
housewives, and I really do not know what my Clara would do without
her motherly help. For, Clara has no mother of her own, Handel, and no
relation in the world but old Gruffandgrim."
 
"Surely thats not his name, Herbert?"
 
"No, no," said Herbert, "thats my name for him. His name is Mr. Barley.
But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a
girl who has no relations, and who can never bother herself or anybody
else about her family!"
 
Herbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that he
first knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her education at
an establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her being recalled home
to nurse her father, he and she had confided their affection to the
motherly Mrs. Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated
with equal kindness and discretion, ever since. It was understood that
nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, by
reason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject
more psychological than Gout, Rum, and Pursers stores.
 
As we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barleys sustained
growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room door
opened, and a very pretty, slight, darkeyed girl of twenty or so came
in with a basket in her hand whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the
basket, and presented, blushing, as "Clara." She really was a most
charming girl, and might have passed for a captive fairy, whom that
truculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his service.
 
"Look here," said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionate
and tender smile, after we had talked a little "heres poor Claras
supper, served out every night. Heres her allowance of bread, and
heres her slice of cheese, and heres her rum,which I drink. This
is Mr. Barleys breakfast for tomorrow, served out to be cooked. Two
muttonchops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, two
ounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper. Its
stewed up together, and taken hot, and its a nice thing for the gout, I
should think!"
 
There was something so natural and winning in Claras resigned way of
looking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out and
something so confiding, loving, and innocent in her modest manner of
yielding herself to Herberts embracing arm and something so gentle in
her, so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinkss Basin,
and the Old Green Copper Ropewalk, with Old Barley growling in the
beam,that I would not have undone the engagement between her and
Herbert for all the money in the pocketbook I had never opened.
 
I was looking at her with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly the
growl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise was heard
above, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through
the ceiling to come at us. Upon this Clara said to Herbert, "Papa wants
me, darling!" and ran away.
 
"There is an unconscionable old shark for you!" said Herbert. "What do
you suppose he wants now, Handel?"
 
"I dont know," said I. "Something to drink?"
 
"Thats it!" cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinary
merit. "He keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table.
Wait a moment, and youll hear Clara lift him up to take some. There
he goes!" Another roar, with a prolonged shake at the end. "Now," said
Herbert, as it was succeeded by silence, "hes drinking. Now," said
Herbert, as the growl resounded in the beam once more, "hes down again
on his back!"
 
Clara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me up stairs to
see our charge. As we passed Mr. Barleys door, he was heard hoarsely
muttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like wind, the
following Refrain, in which I substitute good wishes for something quite
the reverse
 
"Ahoy! Bless your eyes, heres old Bill Barley. Heres old Bill Barley,
bless your eyes. Heres old Bill Barley on the flat of his back, by the
Lord. Lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder,
heres your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Ahoy! Bless you."
 
In this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible Barley
would commune with himself by the day and night together Often, while
it was light, having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope which was
fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river.
 
In his two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh and
airy, and in which Mr. Barley was less audible than below, I found
Provis comfortably settled. He expressed no alarm, and seemed to
feel none that was worth mentioning but it struck me that he was
softened,indefinably, for I could not have said how, and could never
afterwards recall how when I tried, but certainly.
 
The opportunity that the days rest had given me for reflection had
resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting
Compeyson. For anything I knew, his animosity towards the man
might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own
destruction. Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him by his
fire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmicks judgment
and sources of information?
 
"Ay, ay, dear boy!" he answered, with a grave nod, "Jaggers knows."
 
"Then, I have talked with Wemmick," said I, "and have come to tell you
what caution he gave me and what advice."
 
This I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned and I told
him how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison whether from officers or
prisoners I could not say, that he was under some suspicion, and that
my chambers had been watched how Wemmick had recommended his keeping
close for a time, and my keeping away from him and what Wemmick had
said about getting him abroad. I added, that of course, when the time
came, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as might
be safest in Wemmicks judgment. What was to follow that I did not touch
upon neither, indeed, was I at all clear or comfortable about it in my
own mind, now that I saw him in that softer condition, and in declared
peril for my sake. As to altering my way of living by enlarging my
expenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult
circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it were no worse?
 
He could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. His
coming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be a
venture. He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he had
very little fear of his safety with such good help.
 
Herbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said
that something had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmicks
suggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue. "We are both good
watermen, Handel, and could take him down the river ourselves when the
right time comes. No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and no
boatmen that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chance
is worth saving. Never mind the season dont you think it might be a
good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs, and
were in the habit of rowing up and down the river? You fall into that
habit, and then who notices or minds? Do it twenty or fifty times,
and there is nothing special in your doing it the twentyfirst or
fiftyfirst."
 
I liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it. We agreed
that it should be carried into execution, and that Provis should never
recognize us if we came below Bridge, and rowed past Mill Pond Bank. But
we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part of his
window which gave upon the east, whenever he saw us and all was right.
 
Our conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go
remarking to Herbert that he and I had better not go home together, and
that I would take half an hours start of him. "I dont like to leave
you here," I said to Provis, "though I cannot doubt your being safer
here than near me. Good by!"
 
"Dear boy," he answered, clasping my hands, "I dont know when we may
meet again, and I dont like good by. Say good night!"
 
"Good night! Herbert will go regularly between us, and when the time
comes you may be certain I shall be ready. Good night, good night!"
 
We thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms and we left him
on the landing outside his door, holding a light over the stairrail to
light us down stairs. Looking back at him, I thought of the first night
of his return, when our positions were reversed, and when I little
supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him
as it was now.
 
Old Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door, with no
appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease. When we got to the
foot of the stairs, I asked Herbert whether he had preserved the name of
Provis. He replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mr. Campbell.
He also explained that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell there was,
that he Herbert had Mr. Campbell consigned to him, and felt a strong
personal interest in his being well cared for, and living a secluded
life. So, when we went into the parlor where Mrs. Whimple and Clara were
seated at work, I said nothing of my own interest in Mr. Campbell, but
kept it to myself.
 
When I had taken leave of the pretty, gentle, darkeyed girl, and of the
motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little
affair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Ropewalk had
grown quite a different place. Old Barley might be as old as the hills,
and might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there were redeeming
youth and trust and hope enough in Chinkss Basin to fill it to
overflowing. And then I thought of Estella, and of our parting, and went
home very sadly.
 
All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them. The
windows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark
and still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court. I walked past the
fountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between
me and my rooms, but I was quite alone. Herbert, coming to my
bedside when he came in,for I went straight to bed, dispirited and
fatigued,made the same report. Opening one of the windows after that,
he looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was a
solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.
 
Next day I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the boat
was brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach
her within a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training and
practice sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. I was often out in
cold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been
out a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge but as the
hours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. It was Old
London Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there
was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. But I
knew well enough how to shoot the bridge after seeing it done, and so
began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to Erith.
The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were pulling a
pair of oars and, both in going and returning, we saw the blind towards
the east come down. Herbert was rarely there less frequently than three
times in a week, and he never brought me a single word of intelligence
that was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there was cause for alarm,
and I could not get rid of the notion of being watched. Once received,
it is a haunting idea how many undesigning persons I suspected of
watching me, it would be hard to calculate.
 
In short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding.
Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at
one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down, and to
think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards Clara. But
I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch, and that
any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going swiftly,
silently, and surely, to take him.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XLVII
 
Some weeks passed without bringing any change. We waited for Wemmick,
and he made no sign. If I had never known him out of Little Britain, and
had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the
Castle, I might have doubted him not so for a moment, knowing him as I
did.
 
My worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressed
for money by more than one creditor. Even I myself began to know the
want of money I mean of ready money in my own pocket, and to relieve
it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash. But
I had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more
money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and
plans. Therefore, I had sent him the unopened pocketbook by Herbert, to
hold in his own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfactionwhether it
was a false kind or a true, I hardly knowin not having profited by his
generosity since his revelation of himself.
 
As the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that Estella
was married. Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all but a
conviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert to whom I had
confided the circumstances of our last interview never to speak of her
to me. Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of
hope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I know? Why did you
who read this, commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last
year, last month, last week?
 
It was an unhappy life that I lived and its one dominant anxiety,
towering over all its other anxieties, like a high mountain above a
range of mountains, never disappeared from my view. Still, no new cause
for fear arose. Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terror
fresh upon me that he was discovered let me sit listening, as I would
with dread, for Herberts returning step at night, lest it should be
fleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,for all that, and
much more to like purpose, the round of things went on. Condemned to
inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowed
about in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could.
 
There were states of the tide when, having been down the river, I could
not get back through the eddychafed arches and starlings of old London
Bridge then, I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House, to be
brought up afterwards to the Temple stairs. I was not averse to doing
this, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the
waterside people there. From this slight occasion sprang two meetings
that I have now to tell of.
 
One afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the wharf
at dusk. I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide, and
had turned with the tide. It had been a fine bright day, but had become
foggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way back among the
shipping, pretty carefully. Both in going and returning, I had seen the
signal in his window, All well.
 
As it was a raw evening, and I was cold, I thought I would comfort
myself with dinner at once and as I had hours of dejection and solitude
before me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I would afterwards go
to the play. The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achieved his questionable
triumph was in that waterside neighborhood it is nowhere now, and
to that theatre I resolved to go. I was aware that Mr. Wopsle had
not succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on the contrary, had rather
partaken of its decline. He had been ominously heard of, through the
playbills, as a faithful Black, in connection with a little girl of
noble birth, and a monkey. And Herbert had seen him as a predatory
Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red brick, and an
outrageous hat all over bells.
 
I dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chophouse,
where there were maps of the world in porterpot rims on every halfyard
of the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one of the knives,to
this day there is scarcely a single chophouse within the Lord Mayors
dominions which is not geographical,and wore out the time in dozing
over crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast of dinners. By
and by, I roused myself, and went to the play.
 
There, I found a virtuous boatswain in His Majestys service,a most
excellent man, though I could have wished his trousers not quite so
tight in some places, and not quite so loose in others,who knocked all
the little mens hats over their eyes, though he was very generous and
brave, and who wouldnt hear of anybodys paying taxes, though he was
very patriotic. He had a bag of money in his pocket, like a pudding in
the cloth, and on that property married a young person in bedfurniture,
with great rejoicings the whole population of Portsmouth nine in
number at the last census turning out on the beach to rub their own
hands and shake everybody elses, and sing "Fill, fill!" A certain
darkcomplexioned Swab, however, who wouldnt fill, or do anything else
that was proposed to him, and whose heart was openly stated by the
boatswain to be as black as his figurehead, proposed to two other
Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties which was so effectually
done the Swab family having considerable political influence that it
took half the evening to set things right, and then it was only brought
about through an honest little grocer with a white hat, black gaiters,
and red nose, getting into a clock, with a gridiron, and listening, and
coming out, and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron
whom he couldnt confute with what he had overheard. This led to Mr.
Wopsles who had never been heard of before coming in with a star
and garter on, as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the
Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were all to go to prison on the spot,
and that he had brought the boatswain down the Union Jack, as a slight
acknowledgment of his public services. The boatswain, unmanned for the
first time, respectfully dried his eyes on the Jack, and then cheering
up, and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your Honor, solicited permission to
take him by the fin. Mr. Wopsle, conceding his fin with a gracious
dignity, was immediately shoved into a dusty corner, while everybody
danced a hornpipe and from that corner, surveying the public with a
discontented eye, became aware of me.
 
The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in
the first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected
Mr. Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric
countenance and a shock of red curtainfringe for his hair, engaged
in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great
cowardice when his gigantic master came home very hoarse to dinner.
But he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances for,
the Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,on account of
the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice
of his daughters heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a
floursack, out of the firstfloor window,summoned a sententious
Enchanter and he, coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily, after
an apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a highcrowned
hat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm. The business
of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked at, sung at,
butted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various colors,
he had a good deal of time on his hands. And I observed, with great
surprise, that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were
lost in amazement.
 
There was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr.
Wopsles eye, and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his
mind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out. I sat
thinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large
watchcase, and still I could not make it out. I was still thinking
of it when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found him
waiting for me near the door.
 
"How do you do?" said I, shaking hands with him as we turned down the
street together. "I saw that you saw me."
 
"Saw you, Mr. Pip!" he returned. "Yes, of course I saw you. But who else
was there?"
 
"Who else?"
 
"It is the strangest thing," said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his lost
look again "and yet I could swear to him."
 
Becoming alarmed, I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his meaning.
 
"Whether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there,"
said Mr. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, "I cant be positive
yet I think I should."
 
Involuntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look round me
when I went home for these mysterious words gave me a chill.
 
"Oh! He cant be in sight," said Mr. Wopsle. "He went out before I went
off. I saw him go."
 
Having the reason that I had for being suspicious, I even suspected
this poor actor. I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission.
Therefore I glanced at him as we walked on together, but said nothing.
 
"I had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you, Mr. Pip, till I saw
that you were quite unconscious of him, sitting behind you there like a
ghost."
 
My former chill crept over me again, but I was resolved not to speak
yet, for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on
to induce me to connect these references with Provis. Of course, I was
perfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there.
 
"I dare say you wonder at me, Mr. Pip indeed, I see you do. But it is
so very strange! Youll hardly believe what I am going to tell you. I
could hardly believe it myself, if you told me."
 
"Indeed?" said I.
 
"No, indeed. Mr. Pip, you remember in old times a certain Christmas Day,
when you were quite a child, and I dined at Gargerys, and some soldiers
came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended?"
 
"I remember it very well."
 
"And you remember that there was a chase after two convicts, and that we
joined in it, and that Gargery took you on his back, and that I took the
lead, and you kept up with me as well as you could?"
 
"I remember it all very well." Better than he thought,except the last
clause.
 
"And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that
there was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been severely
handled and much mauled about the face by the other?"
 
"I see it all before me."
 
"And that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre,
and that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes,
with the torchlight shining on their faces,I am particular about
that,with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was an
outer ring of dark night all about us?"
 
"Yes," said I. "I remember all that."
 
"Then, Mr. Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight. I saw
him over your shoulder."
 
"Steady!" I thought. I asked him then, "Which of the two do you suppose
you saw?"
 
"The one who had been mauled," he answered readily, "and Ill swear I
saw him! The more I think of him, the more certain I am of him."
 
"This is very curious!" said I, with the best assumption I could put on
of its being nothing more to me. "Very curious indeed!"
 
I cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation
threw me, or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeysons
having been behind me "like a ghost." For if he had ever been out of my
thoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun, it was
in those very moments when he was closest to me and to think that I
should be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if
I had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out, and then had
found him at my elbow. I could not doubt, either, that he was there,
because I was there, and that, however slight an appearance of danger
there might be about us, danger was always near and active.
 
I put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come in? He
could not tell me that he saw me, and over my shoulder he saw the man.
It was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to identify
him but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me, and
known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time. How was
he dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise he thought, in
black. Was his face at all disfigured? No, he believed not. I believed
not too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken no especial
notice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that a face at all
disfigured would have attracted my attention.
 
When Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or I
extract, and when I had treated him to a little appropriate refreshment,
after the fatigues of the evening, we parted. It was between twelve and
one oclock when I reached the Temple, and the gates were shut. No one
was near me when I went in and went home.
 
Herbert had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire. But
there was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to Wemmick what I
had that night found out, and to remind him that we waited for his hint.
As I thought that I might compromise him if I went too often to the
Castle, I made this communication by letter. I wrote it before I went to
bed, and went out and posted it and again no one was near me. Herbert
and I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious. And
we were very cautious indeed,more cautious than before, if that were
possible,and I for my part never went near Chinkss Basin, except
when I rowed by, and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bank as I looked at
anything else.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XLVIII
 
The second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred
about a week after the first. I had again left my boat at the wharf
below Bridge the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon and,
undecided where to dine, I had strolled up into Cheapside, and was
strolling along it, surely the most unsettled person in all the busy
concourse, when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one
overtaking me. It was Mr. Jaggerss hand, and he passed it through my
arm.
 
"As we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together. Where
are you bound for?"
 
"For the Temple, I think," said I.
 
"Dont you know?" said Mr. Jaggers.
 
"Well," I returned, glad for once to get the better of him in
crossexamination, "I do not know, for I have not made up my mind."
 
"You are going to dine?" said Mr. Jaggers. "You dont mind admitting
that, I suppose?"
 
"No," I returned, "I dont mind admitting that."
 
"And are not engaged?"
 
"I dont mind admitting also that I am not engaged."
 
"Then," said Mr. Jaggers, "come and dine with me."
 
I was going to excuse myself, when he added, "Wemmicks coming." So
I changed my excuse into an acceptance,the few words I had uttered,
serving for the beginning of either,and we went along Cheapside
and slanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing up
brilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamplighters, scarcely
finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the
afternoons bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out,
opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at
the Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall.
 
At the office in Little Britain there was the usual letterwriting,
handwashing, candlesnuffing, and safelocking, that closed the
business of the day. As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggerss fire, its rising
and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were
playing a diabolical game at bopeep with me while the pair of coarse,
fat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he wrote in a
corner were decorated with dirty windingsheets, as if in remembrance of
a host of hanged clients.
 
We went to Gerrard Street, all three together, in a hackneycoach And,
as soon as we got there, dinner was served. Although I should not have
thought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much
as a look to Wemmicks Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no
objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way. But it
was not to be done. He turned his eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever he raised
them from the table, and was as dry and distant to me as if there were
twin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one.
 
"Did you send that note of Miss Havishams to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?" Mr.
Jaggers asked, soon after we began dinner.
 
"No, sir," returned Wemmick "it was going by post, when you brought Mr.
Pip into the office. Here it is." He handed it to his principal instead
of to me.
 
"Its a note of two lines, Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on, "sent
up to me by Miss Havisham on account of her not being sure of your
address. She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of
business you mentioned to her. Youll go down?"
 
"Yes," said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in those
terms.
 
"When do you think of going down?"
 
"I have an impending engagement," said I, glancing at Wemmick, who was
putting fish into the postoffice, "that renders me rather uncertain of
my time. At once, I think."
 
"If Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once," said Wemmick to Mr.
Jaggers, "he neednt write an answer, you know."
 
Receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I settled
that I would go tomorrow, and said so. Wemmick drank a glass of wine,
and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers, but not at me.
 
"So, Pip! Our friend the Spider," said Mr. Jaggers, "has played his
cards. He has won the pool."
 
It was as much as I could do to assent.
 
"Hah! He is a promising fellowin his waybut he may not have it all
his own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to
be found out first. If he should turn to, and beat her"
 
"Surely," I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, "you do not
seriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that, Mr. Jaggers?"
 
"I didnt say so, Pip. I am putting a case. If he should turn to and
beat her, he may possibly get the strength on his side if it should be
a question of intellect, he certainly will not. It would be chance
work to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such
circumstances, because its a tossup between two results."
 
"May I ask what they are?"
 
"A fellow like our friend the Spider," answered Mr. Jaggers, "either
beats or cringes. He may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl but
he either beats or cringes. Ask Wemmick his opinion."
 
"Either beats or cringes," said Wemmick, not at all addressing himself
to me.
 
"So heres to Mrs. Bentley Drummle," said Mr. Jaggers, taking a decanter
of choicer wine from his dumbwaiter, and filling for each of us and
for himself, "and may the question of supremacy be settled to the ladys
satisfaction! To the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman,
it never will be. Now, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, how slow you are
today!"
 
She was at his elbow when he addressed her, putting a dish upon the
table. As she withdrew her hands from it, she fell back a step or two,
nervously muttering some excuse. And a certain action of her fingers, as
she spoke, arrested my attention.
 
"Whats the matter?" said Mr. Jaggers.
 
"Nothing. Only the subject we were speaking of," said I, "was rather
painful to me."
 
The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting. She stood
looking at her master, not understanding whether she was free to go, or
whether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did go.
Her look was very intent. Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and such
hands on a memorable occasion very lately!
 
He dismissed her, and she glided out of the room. But she remained
before me as plainly as if she were still there. I looked at those
hands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair and I
compared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of,
and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband
and a stormy life. I looked again at those hands and eyes of the
housekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over
me when I last walkednot alonein the ruined garden, and through the
deserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling had come back when I
saw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stagecoach
window and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like
lightning, when I had passed in a carriagenot alonethrough a sudden
glare of light in a dark street. I thought how one link of association
had helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link,
wanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a
chance swift from Estellas name to the fingers with their knitting
action, and the attentive eyes. And I felt absolutely certain that this
woman was Estellas mother.
 
Mr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missed
the sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. He nodded when I said
the subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the
wine again, and went on with his dinner.
 
Only twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then her stay in the
room was very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her. But her hands
were Estellas hands, and her eyes were Estellas eyes, and if she had
reappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less
sure that my conviction was the truth.
 
It was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew his wine, when it came round,
quite as a matter of business,just as he might have drawn his salary
when that came round,and with his eyes on his chief, sat in a state of
perpetual readiness for crossexamination. As to the quantity of wine,
his postoffice was as indifferent and ready as any other postoffice
for its quantity of letters. From my point of view, he was the wrong
twin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth.
 
We took our leave early, and left together. Even when we were groping
among Mr. Jaggerss stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the right
twin was on his way back and we had not gone half a dozen yards down
Gerrard Street in the Walworth direction, before I found that I was
walking arm in arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin had
evaporated into the evening air.
 
"Well!" said Wemmick, "thats over! Hes a wonderful man, without his
living likeness but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine
with him,and I dine more comfortably unscrewed."
 
I felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him so.
 
"Wouldnt say it to anybody but yourself," he answered. "I know that
what is said between you and me goes no further."
 
I asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havishams adopted daughter, Mrs.
Bentley Drummle. He said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke
of the Aged and of Miss Skiffins. He looked rather sly when I mentioned
Miss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow his nose, with a roll
of the head, and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness.
 
"Wemmick," said I, "do you remember telling me, before I first went to
Mr. Jaggerss private house, to notice that housekeeper?"
 
"Did I?" he replied. "Ah, I dare say I did. Deuce take me," he added,
suddenly, "I know I did. I find I am not quite unscrewed yet."
 
"A wild beast tamed, you called her."
 
"And what do you call her?"
 
"The same. How did Mr. Jaggers tame her, Wemmick?"
 
"Thats his secret. She has been with him many a long year."
 
"I wish you would tell me her story. I feel a particular interest in
being acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you and me
goes no further."
 
"Well!" Wemmick replied, "I dont know her story,that is, I dont know
all of it. But what I do know Ill tell you. We are in our private and
personal capacities, of course."
 
"Of course."
 
"A score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for
murder, and was acquitted. She was a very handsome young woman, and I
believe had some gypsy blood in her. Anyhow, it was hot enough when it
was up, as you may suppose."
 
"But she was acquitted."
 
"Mr. Jaggers was for her," pursued Wemmick, with a look full of meaning,
"and worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a desperate
case, and it was comparatively early days with him then, and he worked
it to general admiration in fact, it may almost be said to have made
him. He worked it himself at the policeoffice, day after day for many
days, contending against even a committal and at the trial where he
couldnt work it himself, sat under counsel, andevery one knewput
in all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,a woman a
good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger. It was
a case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman in
Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick as
we say, to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy.
The murdered woman,more a match for the man, certainly, in point of
yearswas found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had been a
violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratched and
torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now, there
was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman, and
on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr. Jaggers
principally rested his case. You may be sure," said Wemmick, touching me
on the sleeve, "that he never dwelt upon the strength of her hands then,
though he sometimes does now."
 
I had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinner
party.
 
"Well, sir!" Wemmick went on "it happenedhappened, dont you
see?that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of
her apprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was in
particular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully
contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look. She had only a bruise
or two about her,nothing for a tramp,but the backs of her hands
were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with fingernails? Now, Mr.
Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles
which were not as high as her face but which she could not have got
through and kept her hands out of and bits of those brambles were
actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the fact that
the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken
through, and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of
blood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he made was this
it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that she was
under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the murder,
frantically destroyed her child by this mansome three years oldto
revenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way "We say
these are not marks of fingernails, but marks of brambles, and we show
you the brambles. You say they are marks of fingernails, and you set
up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept all
consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have
destroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have scratched
her hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murder of her
child why dont you? As to this case, if you will have scratches,
we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted for them,
assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them?" "To
sum up, sir," said Wemmick, "Mr. Jaggers was altogether too many for the
jury, and they gave in."
 
"Has she been in his service ever since?"
 
"Yes but not only that," said Wemmick, "she went into his service
immediately after her acquittal, tamed as she is now. She has since been
taught one thing and another in the way of her duties, but she was tamed
from the beginning."
 
"Do you remember the sex of the child?"
 
"Said to have been a girl."
 
"You have nothing more to say to me tonight?"
 
"Nothing. I got your letter and destroyed it. Nothing."
 
We exchanged a cordial goodnight, and I went home, with new matter for
my thoughts, though with no relief from the old.
 
 
 
 
Chapter XLIX
 
Putting Miss Havishams note in my pocket, that it might serve as
my credentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House, in case her
waywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me, I went
down again by the coach next day. But I alighted at the Halfway House,
and breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance for I sought
to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and to leave it
in the same manner.
 
The best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet echoing
courts behind the High Street. The nooks of ruin where the old monks had
once had their refectories and gardens, and where the strong walls were
now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables, were almost
as silent as the old monks in their graves. The cathedral chimes had at
once a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurried on avoiding
observation, than they had ever had before so, the swell of the old
organ was borne to my ears like funeral music and the rooks, as they
hovered about the gray tower and swung in the bare high trees of the
priory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was changed, and that
Estella was gone out of it for ever.
 
An elderly woman, whom I had seen before as one of the servants who
lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened the
gate. The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old,
and I took it up and ascended the staircase alone. Miss Havisham was not
in her own room, but was in the larger room across the landing. Looking
in at the door, after knocking in vain, I saw her sitting on the hearth
in a ragged chair, close before, and lost in the contemplation of, the
ashy fire.
 
Doing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the old
chimneypiece, where she could see me when she raised her eyes. There
was an air of utter loneliness upon her, that would have moved me to
pity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I could charge
her with. As I stood compassionating her, and thinking how, in the
progress of time, I too had come to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of
that house, her eyes rested on me. She stared, and said in a low voice,
"Is it real?"
 
"It is I, Pip. Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lost
no time."
 
"Thank you. Thank you."
 
As I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, I
remarked a new expression on her face, as if she were afraid of me.
 
"I want," she said, "to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you
were last here, and to show you that I am not all stone. But perhaps you
can never believe, now, that there is anything human in my heart?"
 
When I said some reassuring words, she stretched out her tremulous right
hand, as though she was going to touch me but she recalled it again
before I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.
 
"You said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to do
something useful and good. Something that you would like done, is it
not?"
 
"Something that I would like done very much."
 
"What is it?"
 
I began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership. I had
not got far into it, when I judged from her looks that she was thinking
in a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said. It seemed to be
so for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before she showed
that she was conscious of the fact.
 
"Do you break off," she asked then, with her former air of being afraid
of me, "because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me?"
 
"No, no," I answered, "how can you think so, Miss Havisham! I stopped
because I thought you were not following what I said."
 
"Perhaps I was not," she answered, putting a hand to her head. "Begin
again, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me."
 
She set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was
habitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of
forcing herself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and told her
how I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how
in this I was disappointed. That part of the subject I reminded her
involved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they
were the weighty secrets of another.
 
"So!" said she, assenting with her head, but not looking at me. "And how
much money is wanting to complete the purchase?"
 
I was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum. "Nine
hundred pounds."
 
"If I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret as
you have kept your own?"
 
"Quite as faithfully."
 
"And your mind will be more at rest?"
 
"Much more at rest."
 
"Are you very unhappy now?"
 
She asked this question, still without looking at me, but in an unwonted
tone of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for my voice failed
me. She put her left arm across the head of her stick, and softly laid
her forehead on it.
 
"I am far from happy, Miss Havisham but I have other causes of disquiet
than any you know of. They are the secrets I have mentioned."
 
After a little while, she raised her head, and looked at the fire Again.
 
"It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of
unhappiness, Is it true?"
 
"Too true."
 
"Can I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend? Regarding that as
done, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?"
 
"Nothing. I thank you for the question. I thank you even more for the
tone of the question. But there is nothing."
 
She presently rose from her seat, and looked about the blighted room
for the means of writing. There were none there, and she took from her
pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, and
wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from
her neck.
 
"You are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?"
 
"Quite. I dined with him yesterday."
 
"This is an authority to him to pay you that money, to lay out at your
irresponsible discretion for your friend. I keep no money here but if
you would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send it
to you."
 
"Thank you, Miss Havisham I have not the least objection to receiving
it from him."
 
She read me what she had written and it was direct and clear, and
evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the
receipt of the money. I took the tablets from her hand, and it trembled
again, and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the
pencil was attached, and put it in mine. All this she did without
looking at me.
 
"My name is on the first leaf. If you can ever write under my name, "I
forgive her," though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do
it!"
 
"O Miss Havisham," said I, "I can do it now. There have been sore
mistakes and my life has been a blind and thankless one and I want
forgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you."
 
She turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it,
and, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on her knees
at my feet with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which,
when her poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often have
been raised to heaven from her mothers side.
 
To see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet
gave me a shock through all my frame. I entreated her to rise, and got
my arms about her to help her up but she only pressed that hand of mine
which was nearest to her grasp, and hung her head over it and wept. I
had never seen her shed a tear before, and, in the hope that the
relief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking. She was not
kneeling now, but was down upon the ground.
 
"O!" she cried, despairingly. "What have I done! What have I done!"
 
"If you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let me
answer. Very little. I should have loved her under any circumstances. Is
she married?"
 
"Yes."
 
It was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate house
had told me so.
 
"What have I done! What have I done!" She wrung her hands, and crushed
her white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again. "What have
I done!"
 
I knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her. That she had done a
grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form
that her wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride found
vengeance in, I knew full well. But that, in shutting out the light
of day, she had shut out infinitely more that, in seclusion, she had
secluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences that,
her mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do and
must and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knew
equally well. And could I look upon her without compassion, seeing her
punishment in the ruin she was, in her profound unfitness for this earth
on which she was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had become a
master mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse, the
vanity of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have been
curses in this world?
 
"Until you spoke to her the other day, and until I saw in you a
lookingglass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not know
what I had done. What have I done! What have I done!" And so again,
twenty, fifty times over, What had she done!
 
"Miss Havisham," I said, when her cry had died away, "you may dismiss me
from your mind and conscience. But Estella is a different case, and if
you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a
part of her right nature away from her, it will be better to do that
than to bemoan the past through a hundred years."
 
"Yes, yes, I know it. But, Pipmy dear!" There was an earnest womanly
compassion for me in her new affection. "My dear! Believe this when she
first came to me, I meant to save her from misery like my own. At first,
I meant no more."
 
"Well, well!" said I. "I hope so."
 
"But as she grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually did
worse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings,
and with this figure of myself always before her, a warning to back and
point my lessons, I stole her heart away, and put ice in its place."
 
"Better," I could not help saying, "to have left her a natural heart,
even to be bruised or broken."
 
With that, Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while, and then
burst out again, What had she done!
 
"If you knew all my story," she pleaded, "you would have some compassion
for me and a better understanding of me."
 
"Miss Havisham," I answered, as delicately as I could, "I believe I may
say that I do know your story, and have known it ever since I first left
this neighborhood. It has inspired me with great commiseration, and I
hope I understand it and its influences. Does what has passed between us
give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to Estella? Not as
she is, but as she was when she first came here?"
 
She was seated on the ground, with her arms on the ragged chair, and
her head leaning on them. She looked full at me when I said this, and
replied, "Go on."
 
"Whose child was Estella?"
 
She shook her head.
 
"You dont know?"
 
She shook her head again.
 
"But Mr. Jaggers brought her here, or sent her here?"
 
"Brought her here."
 
"Will you tell me how that came about?"
 
She answered in a low whisper and with caution "I had been shut up in
these rooms a long time I dont know how long you know what time the
clocks keep here, when I told him that I wanted a little girl to rear
and love, and save from my fate. I had first seen him when I sent
for him to lay this place waste for me having read of him in the
newspapers, before I and the world parted. He told me that he would
look about him for such an orphan child. One night he brought her here
asleep, and I called her Estella."
 
"Might I ask her age then?"
 
"Two or three. She herself knows nothing, but that she was left an
orphan and I adopted her."
 
So convinced I was of that womans being her mother, that I wanted
no evidence to establish the fact in my own mind. But, to any mind, I
thought, the connection here was clear and straight.
 
What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview? I had
succeeded on behalf of Herbert, Miss Havisham had told me all she knew
of Estella, I had said and done what I could to ease her mind. No matter
with what other words we parted we parted.
 
Twilight was closing in when I went down stairs into the natural air. I
called to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered, that I would
not trouble her just yet, but would walk round the place before leaving.
For I had a presentiment that I should never be there again, and I felt
that the dying light was suited to my last view of it.
 
By the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on which
the rain of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places, and
leaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on
end, I made my way to the ruined garden. I went all round it round by
the corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle round by the paths
where Estella and I had walked. So cold, so lonely, so dreary all!
 
Taking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little
door at the garden end of it, and walked through. I was going out at the
opposite door,not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started and
swelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was encumbered
with a growth of fungus,when I turned my head to look back. A childish
association revived with wonderful force in the moment of the slight
action, and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to the beam. So
strong was the impression, that I stood under the beam shuddering from
head to foot before I knew it was a fancy,though to be sure I was
there in an instant.
 
The mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of
this illusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an
indescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I
had once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart. Passing on into
the front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the woman to let me out
at the locked gate of which she had the key, or first to go up stairs
and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I had left
her. I took the latter course and went up.
 
I looked into the room where I had left her, and I saw her seated in the
ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her back towards
me. In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly away,
I saw a great flaming light spring up. In the same moment I saw her
running at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all about her,
and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high.
 
I had a doublecaped greatcoat on, and over my arm another thick coat.
That I got them off, closed with her, threw her down, and got them over
her that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose,
and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst, and
all the ugly things that sheltered there that we were on the ground
struggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I covered her,
the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself,that this
occurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, or
thought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the
floor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were
floating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her faded
bridal dress.
 
Then, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running
away over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries
at the door. I still held her forcibly down with all my strength, like
a prisoner who might escape and I doubt if I even knew who she was, or
why we had struggled, or that she had been in flames, or that the flames
were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments
no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.
 
She was insensible, and I was afraid to have her moved, or even
touched. Assistance was sent for, and I held her until it came, as if
I unreasonably fancied I think I did that, if I let her go, the fire
would break out again and consume her. When I got up, on the surgeons
coming to her with other aid, I was astonished to see that both my hands
were burnt for, I had no knowledge of it through the sense of feeling.
 
On examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts,
but that they of themselves were far from hopeless the danger lay
mainly in the nervous shock. By the surgeons directions, her bed was
carried into that room and laid upon the great table, which happened to
be well suited to the dressing of her injuries. When I saw her again, an
hour afterwards, she lay, indeed, where I had seen her strike her stick,
and had heard her say that she would lie one day.
 
Though every vestige of her dress was burnt, as they told me, she
still had something of her old ghastly bridal appearance for, they had
covered her to the throat with white cottonwool, and as she lay with
a white sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something that
had been and was changed was still upon her.
 
I found, on questioning the servants, that Estella was in Paris, and I
got a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the
next post. Miss Havishams family I took upon myself intending to
communicate with Mr. Matthew Pocket only, and leave him to do as he
liked about informing the rest. This I did next day, through Herbert, as
soon as I returned to town.
 
There was a stage, that evening, when she spoke collectedly of what had
happened, though with a certain terrible vivacity. Towards midnight she
began to wander in her speech and after that it gradually set in that
she said innumerable times in a low solemn voice, "What have I done!"
And then, "When she first came, I meant to save her from misery like
mine." And then, "Take the pencil and write under my name, I forgive
her!" She never changed the order of these three sentences, but she
sometimes left out a word in one or other of them never putting in
another word, but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word.
 
As I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, that pressing
reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could not drive
out of my mind, I decided, in the course of the night that I would
return by the early morning coach, walking on a mile or so, and being
taken up clear of the town. At about six oclock of the morning,
therefore, I leaned over her and touched her lips with mine, just as
they said, not stopping for being touched, "Take the pencil and write
under my name, I forgive her."
 
 
 
 
Chapter L
 
My hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night, and again in
the morning. My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less
severely, as high as the shoulder it was very painful, but the flames
had set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse. My right
hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers. It was
bandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently than my left hand and
arm those I carried in a sling and I could only wear my coat like a
cloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck. My hair had
been caught by the fire, but not my head or face.
 
When Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen his father, he came
back to me at our chambers, and devoted the day to attending on me. He
was the kindest of nurses, and at stated times took off the bandages,
and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready, and put them
on again, with a patient tenderness that I was deeply grateful for.
 
At first, as I lay quiet on the sofa, I found it painfully difficult, I
might say impossible, to get rid of the impression of the glare of the
flames, their hurry and noise, and the fierce burning smell. If I
dozed for a minute, I was awakened by Miss Havishams cries, and by her
running at me with all that height of fire above her head. This pain
of the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I
suffered and Herbert, seeing that, did his utmost to hold my attention
engaged.
 
Neither of us spoke of the boat, but we both thought of it. That
was made apparent by our avoidance of the subject, and by our
agreeingwithout agreementto make my recovery of the use of my hands
a question of so many hours, not of so many weeks.
 
My first question when I saw Herbert had been of course, whether all
was well down the river? As he replied in the affirmative, with perfect
confidence and cheerfulness, we did not resume the subject until the day
was wearing away. But then, as Herbert changed the bandages, more by
the light of the fire than by the outer light, he went back to it
spontaneously.
 
"I sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours."
 
"Where was Clara?"
 
"Dear little thing!" said Herbert. "She was up and down with
Gruffandgrim all the evening. He was perpetually pegging at the floor
the moment she left his sight. I doubt if he can hold out long, though.
What with rum and pepper,and pepper and rum,I should think his
pegging must be nearly over."
 
"And then you will be married, Herbert?"
 
"How can I take care of the dear child otherwise?Lay your arm out upon
the back of the sofa, my dear boy, and Ill sit down here, and get the
bandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes. I was
speaking of Provis. Do you know, Handel, he improves?"
 
"I said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him."
 
"So you did. And so he is. He was very communicative last night, and
told me more of his life. You remember his breaking off here about some
woman that he had had great trouble with.Did I hurt you?"
 
I had started, but not under his touch. His words had given me a start.
 
"I had forgotten that, Herbert, but I remember it now you speak of it."
 
"Well! He went into that part of his life, and a dark wild part it is.
Shall I tell you? Or would it worry you just now?"
 
"Tell me by all means. Every word."
 
Herbert bent forward to look at me more nearly, as if my reply had been
rather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for. "Your
head is cool?" he said, touching it.
 
"Quite," said I. "Tell me what Provis said, my dear Herbert."
 
"It seems," said Herbert, "theres a bandage off most charmingly, and
now comes the cool one,makes you shrink at first, my poor dear fellow,
dont it? but it will be comfortable presently,it seems that the
woman was a young woman, and a jealous woman, and a revengeful woman
revengeful, Handel, to the last degree."
 
"To what last degree?"
 
"Murder.Does it strike too cold on that sensitive place?"
 
"I dont feel it. How did she murder? Whom did she murder?"
 
"Why, the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name,"
said Herbert, "but, she was tried for it, and Mr. Jaggers defended
her, and the reputation of that defence first made his name known
to Provis. It was another and a stronger woman who was the victim,
and there had been a strugglein a barn. Who began it, or how fair
it was, or how unfair, may be doubtful but how it ended is
certainly not doubtful, for the victim was found throttled."
 
"Was the woman brought in guilty?"
 
"No she was acquitted.My poor Handel, I hurt you!"
 
"It is impossible to be gentler, Herbert. Yes? What else?"
 
"This acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child a little
child of whom Provis was exceedingly fond. On the evening of the very
night when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you, the
young woman presented herself before Provis for one moment, and swore
that she would destroy the child which was in her possession, and he
should never see it again then she vanished.Theres the worst arm
comfortably in the sling once more, and now there remains but the right
hand, which is a far easier job. I can do it better by this light
than by a stronger, for my hand is steadiest when I dont see the poor
blistered patches too distinctly.You dont think your breathing is
affected, my dear boy? You seem to breathe quickly."
 
"Perhaps I do, Herbert. Did the woman keep her oath?"
 
"There comes the darkest part of Proviss life. She did."
 
"That is, he says she did."
 
"Why, of course, my dear boy," returned Herbert, in a tone of surprise,
and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me. "He says it all. I
have no other information."
 
"No, to be sure."
 
"Now, whether," pursued Herbert, "he had used the childs mother ill, or
whether he had used the childs mother well, Provis doesnt say but she
had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described
to us at this fireside, and he seems to have felt pity for her, and
forbearance towards her. Therefore, fearing he should be called upon to
depose about this destroyed child, and so be the cause of her death, he
hid himself much as he grieved for the child, kept himself dark, as he
says, out of the way and out of the trial, and was only vaguely talked
of as a certain man called Abel, out of whom the jealousy arose. After
the acquittal she disappeared, and thus he lost the child and the
childs mother."
 
"I want to ask"
 
"A moment, my dear boy, and I have done. That evil genius, Compeyson,
the worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels, knowing of his keeping
out of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so, of course
afterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him
poorer and working him harder. It was clear last night that this barbed
the point of Proviss animosity."
 
"I want to know," said I, "and particularly, Herbert, whether he told
you when this happened?"
 
"Particularly? Let me remember, then, what he said as to that. His
expression was, a round score o year ago, and amost directly after I
took up wi Compeyson. How old were you when you came upon him in the
little churchyard?"
 
"I think in my seventh year."
 
"Ay. It had happened some three or four years then, he said, and you
brought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost, who would have
been about your age."
 
"Herbert," said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way, "can you see
me best by the light of the window, or the light of the fire?"
 
"By the firelight," answered Herbert, coming close again.
 
"Look at me."
 
"I do look at you, my dear boy."
 
"Touch me."
 
"I do touch you, my dear boy."
 
"You are not afraid that I am in any fever, or that my head is much
disordered by the accident of last night?"
 
"Nno, my dear boy," said Herbert, after taking time to examine me. "You
are rather excited, but you are quite yourself."
 
"I know I am quite myself. And the man we have in hiding down the river,
is Estellas Father."
 
 
 
 
Chapter LI
 
What purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving
Estellas parentage, I cannot say. It will presently be seen that the
question was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before
me by a wiser head than my own.
 
But when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I was seized
with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter down,that I
ought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr. Jaggers, and come
at the bare truth. I really do not know whether I felt that I did this
for Estellas sake, or whether I was glad to transfer to the man in
whose preservation I was so much concerned some rays of the romantic
interest that had so long surrounded me. Perhaps the latter possibility
may be the nearer to the truth.
 
Any way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Street
that night. Herberts representations that, if I did, I should probably
be laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitives safety would depend
upon me, alone restrained my impatience. On the understanding, again
and again reiterated, that, come what would, I was to go to Mr. Jaggers
tomorrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my hurts
looked after, and to stay at home. Early next morning we went out
together, and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield, I left
Herbert to go his way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain.
 
There were periodical occasions when Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick went over
the office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all things
straight. On these occasions, Wemmick took his books and papers into Mr.
Jaggerss room, and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the outer
office. Finding such clerk on Wemmicks post that morning, I knew
what was going on but I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick
together, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to
compromise him.
 
My appearance, with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders,
favored my object. Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a brief account of
the accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to give him all
the details now and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk
to be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by the rules of
evidence, than it had been before. While I described the disaster, Mr.
Jaggers stood, according to his wont, before the fire. Wemmick leaned
back in his chair, staring at me, with his hands in the pockets of his
trousers, and his pen put horizontally into the post. The two brutal
casts, always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings,
seemed to be congestively considering whether they didnt smell fire at
the present moment.
 
My narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then produced
Miss Havishams authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for
Herbert. Mr. Jaggerss eyes retired a little deeper into his head when
I handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick,
with instructions to draw the check for his signature. While that was
in course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote, and Mr.
Jaggers, poising and swaying himself on his wellpolished boots, looked
on at me. "I am sorry, Pip," said he, as I put the check in my pocket,
when he had signed it, "that we do nothing for you."
 
"Miss Havisham was good enough to ask me," I returned, "whether she
could do nothing for me, and I told her No."
 
"Everybody should know his own business," said Mr. Jaggers. And I saw
Wemmicks lips form the words "portable property."
 
"I should not have told her No, if I had been you," said Mr Jaggers
"but every man ought to know his own business best."
 
"Every mans business," said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me,
"is portable property."
 
As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at
heart, I said, turning on Mr. Jaggers
 
"I did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir. I asked her to give
me some information relative to her adopted daughter, and she gave me
all she possessed."
 
"Did she?" said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at his boots and
then straightening himself. "Hah! I dont think I should have done so,
if I had been Miss Havisham. But she ought to know her own business
best."
 
"I know more of the history of Miss Havishams adopted child than Miss
Havisham herself does, sir. I know her mother."
 
Mr. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated "Mother?"
 
"I have seen her mother within these three days."
 
"Yes?" said Mr. Jaggers.
 
"And so have you, sir. And you have seen her still more recently."
 
"Yes?" said Mr. Jaggers.
 
"Perhaps I know more of Estellas history than even you do," said I. "I
know her father too."
 
A certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his mannerhe was too
selfpossessed to change his manner, but he could not help its being
brought to an indefinably attentive stopassured me that he did not
know who her father was. This I had strongly suspected from Proviss
account as Herbert had repeated it of his having kept himself dark
which I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggerss
client until some four years later, and when he could have no reason for
claiming his identity. But, I could not be sure of this unconsciousness
on Mr. Jaggerss part before, though I was quite sure of it now.
 
"So! You know the young ladys father, Pip?" said Mr. Jaggers.
 
"Yes," I replied, "and his name is Provisfrom New South Wales."
 
Even Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the slightest
start that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the
sooner checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of the
action of taking out his pockethandkerchief. How Wemmick received the
announcement I am unable to say for I was afraid to look at him just
then, lest Mr. Jaggerss sharpness should detect that there had been
some communication unknown to him between us.
 
"And on what evidence, Pip," asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he
paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose, "does Provis make
this claim?"
 
"He does not make it," said I, "and has never made it, and has no
knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence."
 
For once, the powerful pockethandkerchief failed. My reply was so
Unexpected, that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket
without completing the usual performance, folded his arms, and looked
with stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.
 
Then I told him all I knew, and how I knew it with the one reservation
that I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact
knew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor did I look
towards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been for
some time silently meeting Mr. Jaggerss look. When I did at last turn
my eyes in Wemmicks direction, I found that he had unposted his pen,
and was intent upon the table before him.
 
"Hah!" said Mr. Jaggers at last, as he moved towards the papers on the
table. "What item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?"
 
But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a
passionate, almost an indignant appeal, to him to be more frank and
manly with me. I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had
lapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had
made and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. I
represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from
him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said that
I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wanted
assurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I wanted it,
and why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as he
cared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,
and that although I had lost her, and must live a bereaved life,
whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything
else in the world. And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still and
silent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to
Wemmick, and said, "Wemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle
heart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the
innocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business
life. And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and to
represent to him that, all circumstances considered, he ought to be more
open with me!"
 
I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr.
Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving
crossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his
employment but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something like
a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.
 
"Whats all this?" said Mr. Jaggers. "You with an old father, and you
with pleasant and playful ways?"
 
"Well!" returned Wemmick. "If I dont bring em here, what does it
matter?"
 
"Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smiling
openly, "this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London."
 
"Not a bit of it," returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder. "I think
youre another."
 
Again they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still
distrustful that the other was taking him in.
 
"You with a pleasant home?" said Mr. Jaggers.
 
"Since it dont interfere with business," returned Wemmick, "let it be
so. Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldnt wonder if you might be planning
and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days,
when youre tired of all this work."
 
Mr. Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, and
actually drew a sigh. "Pip," said he, "we wont talk about poor
dreams you know more about such things than I, having much fresher
experience of that kind. But now about this other matter. Ill put a
case to you. Mind! I admit nothing."
 
He waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expressly
said that he admitted nothing.
 
"Now, Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, "put this case. Put the case that a
woman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her child
concealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser,
on his representing to her that he must know, with an eye to the
latitude of his defence, how the fact stood about that child. Put the
case that, at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an
eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up."
 
"I follow you, sir."
 
"Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all he
saw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain
destruction. Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at
a criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen put the case that
he habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported,
neglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing
up to be hanged. Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw
in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much
spawn, to develop into the fish that were to come to his net,to be
prosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow."
 
"I follow you, sir."
 
"Put the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the
heap who could be saved whom the father believed dead, and dared make
no stir about as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this
power "I know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and so, you
did such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked you through
it all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless it should
be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be produced.
Give the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bring you off. If
you are saved, your child is saved too if you are lost, your child is
still saved." Put the case that this was done, and that the woman was
cleared."
 
"I understand you perfectly."
 
"But that I make no admissions?"
 
"That you make no admissions." And Wemmick repeated, "No admissions."
 
"Put the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little
shaken the womans intellects, and that when she was set at liberty,
she was scared out of the ways of the world, and went to him to be
sheltered. Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down the
old, wild, violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking
out, by asserting his power over her in the old way. Do you comprehend
the imaginary case?"
 
"Quite."
 
"Put the case that the child grew up, and was married for money. That
the mother was still living. That the father was still living. That the
mother and father, unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many
miles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another. That the secret was
still a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that last case
to yourself very carefully."
 
"I do."
 
"I ask Wemmick to put it to himself very carefully."
 
And Wemmick said, "I do."
 
"For whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the fathers? I think
he would not be much the better for the mother. For the mothers? I
think if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was.
For the daughters? I think it would hardly serve her to establish her
parentage for the information of her husband, and to drag her back to
disgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last for
life. But add the case that you had loved her, Pip, and had made her the
subject of those poor dreams which have, at one time or another, been
in the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell you that you
had betterand would much sooner when you had thought well of itchop
off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand, and
then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut that off too."
 
I looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave. He gravely touched his
lips with his forefinger. I did the same. Mr. Jaggers did the same.
"Now, Wemmick," said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, "what
item was it you were at when Mr. Pip came in?"
 
Standing by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the
odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times with
this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to say
conscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to
the other. For this reason, I suppose, they were now inflexible with one
another Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and Wemmick obstinately
justifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for
a moment. I had never seen them on such ill terms for generally they
got on very well indeed together.
 
But they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of Mike,
the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on his
sleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance within
those walls. This individual, who, either in his own person or in that
of some member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble which in
that place meant Newgate, called to announce that his eldest daughter
was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting. As he imparted this melancholy
circumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisterially before the
fire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mikes eye happened to
twinkle with a tear.
 
"What are you about?" demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation.
"What do you come snivelling here for?"
 
"I didnt go to do it, Mr. Wemmick."
 
"You did," said Wemmick. "How dare you? Youre not in a fit state to
come here, if you cant come here without spluttering like a bad pen.
What do you mean by it?"
 
"A man cant help his feelings, Mr. Wemmick," pleaded Mike.
 
"His what?" demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. "Say that again!"
 
"Now look here my man," said Mr. Jaggers, advancing a step, and pointing
to the door. "Get out of this office. Ill have no feelings here. Get
out."
 
"It serves you right," said Wemmick, "Get out."
 
So, the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers and
Wemmick appeared to have reestablished their good understanding, and
went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had
just had lunch.
 
 
 
 
Chapter LII
 
 
From Little Britain I went, with my check in my pocket, to Miss
Skiffinss brother, the accountant and Miss Skiffinss brother, the
accountant, going straight to Clarrikers and bringing Clarriker to me,
I had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement. It was the
only good thing I had done, and the only completed thing I had done,
since I was first apprised of my great expectations.
 
Clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the House
were steadily progressing, that he would now be able to establish a
small branchhouse in the East which was much wanted for the extension
of the business, and that Herbert in his new partnership capacity would
go out and take charge of it, I found that I must have prepared for
a separation from my friend, even though my own affairs had been more
settled. And now, indeed, I felt as if my last anchor were loosening its
hold, and I should soon be driving with the winds and waves.
 
But there was recompense in the joy with which Herbert would come home
of a night and tell me of these changes, little imagining that he told
me no news, and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting Clara
Barley to the land of the Arabian Nights, and of me going out to join
them with a caravan of camels, I believe, and of our all going up the
Nile and seeing wonders. Without being sanguine as to my own part in
those bright plans, I felt that Herberts way was clearing fast, and
that old Bill Barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum, and his
daughter would soon be happily provided for.
 
We had now got into the month of March. My left arm, though it presented
no bad symptoms, took, in the natural course, so long to heal that I
was still unable to get a coat on. My right arm was tolerably restored
disfigured, but fairly serviceable.
 
On a Monday morning, when Herbert and I were at breakfast, I received
the following letter from Wemmick by the post.
 
"Walworth. Burn this as soon as read. Early in the week, or say
Wednesday, you might do what you know of, if you felt disposed to try
it. Now burn."
 
When I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the firebut not
before we had both got it by heartwe considered what to do. For, of
course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view.
 
"I have thought it over again and again," said Herbert, "and I think I
know a better course than taking a Thames waterman. Take Startop. A good
fellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic and honorable."
 
I had thought of him more than once.
 
"But how much would you tell him, Herbert?"
 
"It is necessary to tell him very little. Let him suppose it a mere
freak, but a secret one, until the morning comes then let him know that
there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away. You go
with him?"
 
"No doubt."
 
"Where?"
 
It had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given the
point, almost indifferent what port we made for,Hamburg, Rotterdam,
Antwerp,the place signified little, so that he was out of England. Any
foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do.
I had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the
boat certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for
search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot. As foreign steamers would
leave London at about the time of highwater, our plan would be to get
down the river by a previous ebbtide, and lie by in some quiet spot
until we could pull off to one. The time when one would be due where we
lay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we
made inquiries beforehand.
 
Herbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after
breakfast to pursue our investigations. We found that a steamer for
Hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our
thoughts chiefly to that vessel. But we noted down what other foreign
steamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfied
ourselves that we knew the build and color of each. We then separated
for a few hours I, to get at once such passports as were necessary
Herbert, to see Startop at his lodgings. We both did what we had to do
without any hindrance, and when we met again at one oclock reported
it done. I, for my part, was prepared with passports Herbert had seen
Startop, and he was more than ready to join.
 
Those two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer our
charge would be sitter, and keep quiet as speed was not our object, we
should make way enough. We arranged that Herbert should not come home to
dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening that he should
not go there at all tomorrow evening, Tuesday that he should prepare
Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, on Wednesday, when
he saw us approach, and not sooner that all the arrangements with
him should be concluded that Monday night and that he should be
communicated with no more in any way, until we took him on board.
 
These precautions well understood by both of us, I went home.
 
On opening the outer door of our chambers with my key, I found a letter
in the box, directed to me a very dirty letter, though not illwritten.
It had been delivered by hand of course, since I left home, and its
contents were these
 
"If you are not afraid to come to the old marshes tonight or tomorrow
night at nine, and to come to the little sluicehouse by the limekiln,
you had better come. If you want information regarding your uncle
Provis, you had much better come and tell no one, and lose no time. You
must come alone. Bring this with you."
 
I had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange
letter. What to do now, I could not tell. And the worst was, that I must
decide quickly, or I should miss the afternoon coach, which would take
me down in time for tonight. Tomorrow night I could not think of
going, for it would be too close upon the time of the flight. And again,
for anything I knew, the proffered information might have some important
bearing on the flight itself.
 
If I had had ample time for consideration, I believe I should still have
gone. Having hardly any time for consideration,my watch showing me
that the coach started within half an hour,I resolved to go. I should
certainly not have gone, but for the reference to my Uncle Provis. That,
coming on Wemmicks letter and the mornings busy preparation, turned
the scale.
 
It is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost
any letter, in a violent hurry, that I had to read this mysterious
epistle again twice, before its injunction to me to be secret got
mechanically into my mind. Yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of
way, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, telling him that as I should
be so soon going away, I knew not for how long, I had decided to hurry
down and back, to ascertain for myself how Miss Havisham was faring.
I had then barely time to get my greatcoat, lock up the chambers,
and make for the coachoffice by the short byways. If I had taken a
hackneychariot and gone by the streets, I should have missed my aim
going as I did, I caught the coach just as it came out of the yard. I
was the only inside passenger, jolting away kneedeep in straw, when I
came to myself.
 
For I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter it had
so bewildered me, ensuing on the hurry of the morning. The morning hurry
and flutter had been great for, long and anxiously as I had waited for
Wemmick, his hint had come like a surprise at last. And now I began
to wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to doubt whether I had
sufficient reason for being there, and to consider whether I should
get out presently and go back, and to argue against ever heeding an
anonymous communication, and, in short, to pass through all those phases
of contradiction and indecision to which I suppose very few hurried
people are strangers. Still, the reference to Provis by name mastered
everything. I reasoned as I had reasoned already without knowing it,if
that be reasoning,in case any harm should befall him through my not
going, how could I ever forgive myself!
 
It was dark before we got down, and the journey seemed long and dreary
to me, who could see little of it inside, and who could not go outside
in my disabled state. Avoiding the Blue Boar, I put up at an inn of
minor reputation down the town, and ordered some dinner. While it was
preparing, I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham she was
still very ill, though considered something better.
 
My inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and I
dined in a little octagonal commonroom, like a font. As I was not able
to cut my dinner, the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for
me. This bringing us into conversation, he was so good as to entertain
me with my own story,of course with the popular feature that
Pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes.
 
"Do you know the young man?" said I.
 
"Know him!" repeated the landlord. "Ever since he wasno height at
all."
 
"Does he ever come back to this neighborhood?"
 
"Ay, he comes back," said the landlord, "to his great friends, now and
again, and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him."
 
"What man is that?"
 
"Him that I speak of," said the landlord. "Mr. Pumblechook."
 
"Is he ungrateful to no one else?"
 
"No doubt he would be, if he could," returned the landlord, "but he
cant. And why? Because Pumblechook done everything for him."
 
"Does Pumblechook say so?"
 
"Say so!" replied the landlord. "He hant no call to say so."
 
"But does he say so?"
 
"It would turn a mans blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of
it, sir," said the landlord.
 
I thought, "Yet Joe, dear Joe, you never tell of it. Longsuffering and
loving Joe, you never complain. Nor you, sweettempered Biddy!"
 
"Your appetites been touched like by your accident," said the landlord,
glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat. "Try a tenderer bit."
 
"No, thank you," I replied, turning from the table to brood over the
fire. "I can eat no more. Please take it away."
 
I had never been struck at so keenly, for my thanklessness to Joe, as
through the brazen impostor Pumblechook. The falser he, the truer Joe
the meaner he, the nobler Joe.
 
My heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over the fire
for an hour or more. The striking of the clock aroused me, but not from
my dejection or remorse, and I got up and had my coat fastened round
my neck, and went out. I had previously sought in my pockets for the
letter, that I might refer to it again but I could not find it, and
was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of
the coach. I knew very well, however, that the appointed place was the
little sluicehouse by the limekiln on the marshes, and the hour nine.
Towards the marshes I now went straight, having no time to spare.
 
 
 
 
Chapter LIII
 
It was a dark night, though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed
lands, and passed out upon the marshes. Beyond their dark line there was
a ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon.
In a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field, in among the
piled mountains of cloud.
 
There was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal. A
stranger would have found them insupportable, and even to me they were
so oppressive that I hesitated, half inclined to go back. But I knew
them well, and could have found my way on a far darker night, and had
no excuse for returning, being there. So, having come there against my
inclination, I went on against it.
 
The direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay, nor
that in which we had pursued the convicts. My back was turned towards
the distant Hulks as I walked on, and, though I could see the old lights
away on the spits of sand, I saw them over my shoulder. I knew the
limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were miles apart
so that, if a light had been burning at each point that night, there
would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright
specks.
 
At first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to stand
still while the cattle that were lying in the bankedup pathway arose
and blundered down among the grass and reeds. But after a little while I
seemed to have the whole flats to myself.
 
It was another halfhour before I drew near to the kiln. The lime was
burning with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up and
left, and no workmen were visible. Hard by was a small stonequarry. It
lay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by the
tools and barrows that were lying about.
 
Coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation,for the rude
path lay through it,I saw a light in the old sluicehouse. I quickened
my pace, and knocked at the door with my hand. Waiting for some reply,
I looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken, and
how the houseof wood with a tiled roofwould not be proof against the
weather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud and ooze
were coated with lime, and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a
ghostly way towards me. Still there was no answer, and I knocked again.
No answer still, and I tried the latch.
 
It rose under my hand, and the door yielded. Looking in, I saw a lighted
candle on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a truckle bedstead. As
there was a loft above, I called, "Is there any one here?" but no voice
answered. Then I looked at my watch, and, finding that it was past nine,
called again, "Is there any one here?" There being still no answer, I
went out at the door, irresolute what to do.
 
It was beginning to rain fast. Seeing nothing save what I had seen
already, I turned back into the house, and stood just within the shelter
of the doorway, looking out into the night. While I was considering that
some one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back, or
the candle would not be burning, it came into my head to look if the
wick were long. I turned round to do so, and had taken up the candle in
my hand, when it was extinguished by some violent shock and the next
thing I comprehended was, that I had been caught in a strong running
noose, thrown over my head from behind.
 
"Now," said a suppressed voice with an oath, "Ive got you!"
 
"What is this?" I cried, struggling. "Who is it? Help, help, help!"
 
Not only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure on
my bad arm caused me exquisite pain. Sometimes, a strong mans hand,
sometimes a strong mans breast, was set against my mouth to deaden
my cries, and with a hot breath always close to me, I struggled
ineffectually in the dark, while I was fastened tight to the wall. "And
now," said the suppressed voice with another oath, "call out again, and
Ill make short work of you!"
 
Faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by the
surprise, and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in
execution, I desisted, and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little.
But, it was bound too tight for that. I felt as if, having been burnt
before, it were now being boiled.
 
The sudden exclusion of the night, and the substitution of black
darkness in its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter.
After groping about for a little, he found the flint and steel he
wanted, and began to strike a light. I strained my sight upon the sparks
that fell among the tinder, and upon which he breathed and breathed,
match in hand, but I could only see his lips, and the blue point of
the match even those but fitfully. The tinder was damp,no wonder
there,and one after another the sparks died out.
 
The man was in no hurry, and struck again with the flint and steel. As
the sparks fell thick and bright about him, I could see his hands, and
touches of his face, and could make out that he was seated and bending
over the table but nothing more. Presently I saw his blue lips again,
breathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, and
showed me Orlick.
 
Whom I had looked for, I dont know. I had not looked for him. Seeing
him, I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept my eyes
upon him.
 
He lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation,
and dropped the match, and trod it out. Then he put the candle away from
him on the table, so that he could see me, and sat with his arms folded
on the table and looked at me. I made out that I was fastened to a stout
perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall,a fixture there,the
means of ascent to the loft above.
 
"Now," said he, when we had surveyed one another for some time, "Ive
got you."
 
"Unbind me. Let me go!"
 
"Ah!" he returned, "Ill let you go. Ill let you go to the moon, Ill
let you go to the stars. All in good time."
 
"Why have you lured me here?"
 
"Dont you know?" said he, with a deadly look.
 
"Why have you set upon me in the dark?"
 
"Because I mean to do it all myself. One keeps a secret better than two.
O you enemy, you enemy!"
 
His enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as he sat with his arms
folded on the table, shaking his head at me and hugging himself, had a
malignity in it that made me tremble. As I watched him in silence,
he put his hand into the corner at his side, and took up a gun with a
brassbound stock.
 
"Do you know this?" said he, making as if he would take aim at me. "Do
you know where you saw it afore? Speak, wolf!"
 
"Yes," I answered.
 
"You cost me that place. You did. Speak!"
 
"What else could I do?"
 
"You did that, and that would be enough, without more. How dared you to
come betwixt me and a young woman I liked?"
 
"When did I?"
 
"When didnt you? It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name to
her."
 
"You gave it to yourself you gained it for yourself. I could have done
you no harm, if you had done yourself none."
 
"Youre a liar. And youll take any pains, and spend any money, to drive
me out of this country, will you?" said he, repeating my words to Biddy
in the last interview I had with her. "Now, Ill tell you a piece of
information. It was never so well worth your while to get me out of this
country as it is tonight. Ah! If it was all your money twenty times
told, to the last brass farden!" As he shook his heavy hand at me, with
his mouth snarling like a tigers, I felt that it was true.
 
"What are you going to do to me?"
 
"Im a going," said he, bringing his fist down upon the table with a
heavy blow, and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force,"Im
a going to have your life!"
 
He leaned forward staring at me, slowly unclenched his hand and drew it
across his mouth as if his mouth watered for me, and sat down again.
 
"You was always in Old Orlicks way since ever you was a child. You goes
out of his way this present night. Hell have no more on you. Youre
dead."
 
I felt that I had come to the brink of my grave. For a moment I looked
wildly round my trap for any chance of escape but there was none.
 
"More than that," said he, folding his arms on the table again, "I wont
have a rag of you, I wont have a bone of you, left on earth. Ill put
your body in the kiln,Id carry two such to it, on my Shoulders,and,
let people suppose what they may of you, they shall never know nothing."
 
My mind, with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences
of such a death. Estellas father would believe I had deserted him,
would be taken, would die accusing me even Herbert would doubt me,
when he compared the letter I had left for him with the fact that I had
called at Miss Havishams gate for only a moment Joe and Biddy would
never know how sorry I had been that night, none would ever know what
I had suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an agony I had passed
through. The death close before me was terrible, but far more terrible
than death was the dread of being misremembered after death. And
so quick were my thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborn
generations,Estellas children, and their children,while the
wretchs words were yet on his lips.
 
"Now, wolf," said he, "afore I kill you like any other beast,which is
wot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for,Ill have a good look
at you and a good goad at you. O you enemy!"
 
It had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again though
few could know better than I, the solitary nature of the spot, and the
hopelessness of aid. But as he sat gloating over me, I was supported by
a scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips. Above all things, I
resolved that I would not entreat him, and that I would die making some
last poor resistance to him. Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of
men were in that dire extremity humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, of
Heaven melted at heart, as I was, by the thought that I had taken no
farewell, and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to
me, or could explain myself to them, or ask for their compassion on my
miserable errors,still, if I could have killed him, even in dying, I
would have done it.
 
He had been drinking, and his eyes were red and bloodshot. Around his
neck was slung a tin bottle, as I had often seen his meat and drink
slung about him in other days. He brought the bottle to his lips, and
took a fiery drink from it and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw
flash into his face.
 
"Wolf!" said he, folding his arms again, "Old Orlicks a going to tell
you somethink. It was you as did for your shrew sister."
 
Again my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted the
whole subject of the attack upon my sister, her illness, and her death,
before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words.
 
"It was you, villain," said I.
 
"I tell you it was your doing,I tell you it was done through you," he
retorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at the
vacant air between us. "I come upon her from behind, as I come upon you
tonight. I giv it her! I left her for dead, and if there had been a
limekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you, she shouldnt have come
to life again. But it warnt Old Orlick as did it it was you. You was
favored, and he was bullied and beat. Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh?
Now you pays for it. You done it now you pays for it."
 
He drank again, and became more ferocious. I saw by his tilting of
the bottle that there was no great quantity left in it. I distinctly
understood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an
end of me. I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life. I knew
that when I was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards
me but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, he would do
as he had done in my sisters case,make all haste to the town, and
be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses. My rapid mind
pursued him to the town, made a picture of the street with him in it,
and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white
vapor creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved.
 
It was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years
while he said a dozen words, but that what he did say presented pictures
to me, and not mere words. In the excited and exalted state of my brain,
I could not think of a place without seeing it, or of persons without
seeing them. It is impossible to overstate the vividness of these
images, and yet I was so intent, all the time, upon him himself,who
would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring!that I knew of
the slightest action of his fingers.
 
When he had drunk this second time, he rose from the bench on which
he sat, and pushed the table aside. Then, he took up the candle, and,
shading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me, stood
before me, looking at me and enjoying the sight.
 
"Wolf, Ill tell you something more. It was Old Orlick as you tumbled
over on your stairs that night."
 
I saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps. I saw the shadows of
the heavy stairrails, thrown by the watchmans lantern on the wall.
I saw the rooms that I was never to see again here, a door half open
there, a door closed all the articles of furniture around.
 
"And why was Old Orlick there? Ill tell you something more, wolf.
You and her have pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far as
getting a easy living in it goes, and Ive took up with new companions,
and new masters. Some of em writes my letters when I wants em
wrote,do you mind?writes my letters, wolf! They writes fifty hands
theyre not like sneaking you, as writes but one. Ive had a firm mind
and a firm will to have your life, since you was down here at your
sisters burying. I hant seen a way to get you safe, and Ive looked
arter you to know your ins and outs. For, says Old Orlick to himself,
Somehow or another Ill have him! What! When I looks for you, I finds
your uncle Provis, eh?"
 
Mill Pond Bank, and Chinkss Basin, and the Old Green Copper Ropewalk,
all so clear and plain! Provis in his rooms, the signal whose use was
over, pretty Clara, the good motherly woman, old Bill Barley on his
back, all drifting by, as on the swift stream of my life fast running
out to sea!
 
"You with a uncle too! Why, I knowd you at Gargerys when you was so
small a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and
thumb and chucked you away dead as Id thoughts o doing, odd times,
when I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday, and you
hadnt found no uncles then. No, not you! But when Old Orlick come for
to hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the legiron wot Old
Orlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year
ago, and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it, like
a bullock, as he means to drop youhey?when he come for to hear
thathey?"
 
In his savage taunting, he flared the candle so close at me that I
turned my face aside to save it from the flame.
 
"Ah!" he cried, laughing, after doing it again, "the burnt child dreads
the fire! Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick knowed you was
smuggling your uncle Provis away, Old Orlicks a match for you and
knowd youd come tonight! Now Ill tell you something more, wolf, and
this ends it. Theres them thats as good a match for your uncle Provis
as Old Orlick has been for you. Let him ware them, when hes lost his
nevvy! Let him ware them, when no man cant find a rag of his dear
relations clothes, nor yet a bone of his body. Theres them that cant
and that wont have Magwitch,yes, I know the name!alive in the same
land with them, and thats had such sure information of him when he
was alive in another land, as that he couldnt and shouldnt leave it
unbeknown and put them in danger. Praps its them that writes fifty
hands, and thats not like sneaking you as writes but one. Ware
Compeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows!"
 
He flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for an
instant blinding me, and turned his powerful back as he replaced the
light on the table. I had thought a prayer, and had been with Joe and
Biddy and Herbert, before he turned towards me again.
 
There was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite
wall. Within this space, he now slouched backwards and forwards. His
great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever before, as he
did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his sides, and with
his eyes scowling at me. I had no grain of hope left. Wild as my inward
hurry was, and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me
instead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understand that, unless he had
resolved that I was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all
human knowledge, he would never have told me what he had told.
 
Of a sudden, he stopped, took the cork out of his bottle, and tossed
it away. Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet. He swallowed
slowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now he looked at
me no more. The last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of his
hand, and licked up. Then, with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing
horribly, he threw the bottle from him, and stooped and I saw in his
hand a stonehammer with a long heavy handle.
 
The resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering
one vain word of appeal to him, I shouted out with all my might, and
struggled with all my might. It was only my head and my legs that I
could move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, until
then unknown, that was within me. In the same instant I heard responsive
shouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door, heard
voices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of men, as if
it were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and fly out into the
night.
 
After a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in the
same place, with my head on some ones knee. My eyes were fixed on the
ladder against the wall, when I came to myself,had opened on it before
my mind saw it,and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I
was in the place where I had lost it.
 
Too indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who supported
me, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came between me and it
a face. The face of Trabbs boy!
 
"I think hes all right!" said Trabbs boy, in a sober voice "but aint
he just pale though!"
 
At these words, the face of him who supported me looked over into mine,
and I saw my supporter to be
 
"Herbert! Great Heaven!"
 
"Softly," said Herbert. "Gently, Handel. Dont be too eager."
 
"And our old comrade, Startop!" I cried, as he too bent over me.
 
"Remember what he is going to assist us in," said Herbert, "and be
calm."
 
The allusion made me spring up though I dropped again from the pain
in my arm. "The time has not gone by, Herbert, has it? What night is
tonight? How long have I been here?" For, I had a strange and
strong misgiving that I had been lying there a long timea day and a
night,two days and nights,more.
 
"The time has not gone by. It is still Monday night."
 
"Thank God!"
 
"And you have all tomorrow, Tuesday, to rest in," said Herbert. "But
you cant help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Can you
stand?"
 
"Yes, yes," said I, "I can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbing
arm."
 
They laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollen and
inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched. But, they tore
up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully replaced
it in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling
lotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut the door of the
dark and empty sluicehouse, and were passing through the quarry on our
way back. Trabbs boyTrabbs overgrown young man nowwent before us
with a lantern, which was the light I had seen come in at the door. But,
the moon was a good two hours higher than when I had last seen the sky,
and the night, though rainy, was much lighter. The white vapor of the
kiln was passing from us as we went by, and as I had thought a prayer
before, I thought a thanksgiving now.
 
Entreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue,which at
first he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining
quiet,I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our
chambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had
met in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I
was gone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the
inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. His
uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an
hours consideration, he set off for the coachoffice with Startop, who
volunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went
down. Finding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his
uneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he
resolved to follow in a postchaise. So he and Startop arrived at the
Blue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me but,
finding neither, went on to Miss Havishams, where they lost me.
Hereupon they went back to the hotel doubtless at about the time when
I was hearing the popular local version of my own story to refresh
themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes. Among
the loungers under the Boars archway happened to be Trabbs Boy,true
to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no
business,and Trabbs boy had seen me passing from Miss Havishams in
the direction of my diningplace. Thus Trabbs boy became their guide,
and with him they went out to the sluicehouse, though by the town way
to the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went along, Herbert
reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought there on some
genuine and serviceable errand tending to Proviss safety, and,
bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous,
left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and went on by
himself, and stole round the house two or three times, endeavouring to
ascertain whether all was right within. As he could hear nothing but
indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice this was while my mind was so
busy, he even at last began to doubt whether I was there, when suddenly
I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries, and rushed in, closely
followed by the other two.
 
When I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he was for our
immediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it
was, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that such
a course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might
be fatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we
relinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the
present, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather
light of the matter to Trabbs boy who, I am convinced, would have been
much affected by disappointment, if he had known that his intervention
saved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabbs boy was of a malignant
nature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that it was in his
constitution to want variety and excitement at anybodys expense. When
we parted, I presented him with two guineas which seemed to meet his
views, and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of
him which made no impression on him at all.
 
Wednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to London
that night, three in the postchaise the rather, as we should then be
clear away before the nights adventure began to be talked of. Herbert
got a large bottle of stuff for my arm and by dint of having this stuff
dropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear its pain
on the journey. It was daylight when we reached the Temple, and I went
at once to bed, and lay in bed all day.
 
My terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted for
tomorrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of
itself. It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the
mental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon
me that tomorrow was. So anxiously looked forward to, charged with such
consequences, its results so impenetrably hidden, though so near.
 
No precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining
from communication with him that day yet this again increased my
restlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believing
that he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell
me so. I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken that there was
something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment that the fact
had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the days wore
on, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell,
my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before tomorrow
morning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my burning
head throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to
high numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew
in prose and verse. It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a
fatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot then I would say to
myself with a start, "Now it has come, and I am turning delirious!"
 
They kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly dressed, and
gave me cooling drinks. Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the notion
I had had in the sluicehouse, that a long time had elapsed and the
opportunity to save him was gone. About midnight I got out of bed
and went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep for
fourandtwenty hours, and that Wednesday was past. It was the last
selfexhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after that I slept
soundly.
 
Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window. The winking
lights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a
marsh of fire on the horizon. The river, still dark and mysterious, was
spanned by bridges that were turning coldly gray, with here and there
at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky. As I looked along
the clustered roofs, with churchtowers and spires shooting into the
unusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn from
the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters. From me
too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.
 
Herbert lay asleep in his bed, and our old fellowstudent lay asleep on
the sofa. I could not dress myself without help but I made up the fire,
which was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them. In good
time they too started up strong and well, and we admitted the sharp
morning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was still
flowing towards us.
 
"When it turns at nine oclock," said Herbert, cheerfully, "look out for
us, and stand ready, you over there at Mill Pond Bank!"
 
 
 
 
Chapter LIV
 
It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind
blows cold when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.
We had our peacoats with us, and I took a bag. Of all my worldly
possessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the
bag. Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, were
questions utterly unknown to me nor did I vex my mind with them, for
it was wholly set on Proviss safety. I only wondered for the passing
moment, as I stopped at the door and looked back, under what altered
circumstances I should next see those rooms, if ever.
 
We loitered down to the Temple stairs, and stood loitering there, as if
we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all. Of course, I had
taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order. After
a little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two
or three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went
on board and cast off Herbert in the bow, I steering. It was then about
highwater,halfpast eight.
 
Our plan was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being
with us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned,
and row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long
reaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is
broad and solitary, where the waterside inhabitants are very few, and
where lone publichouses are scattered here and there, of which we could
choose one for a restingplace. There, we meant to lie by all night.
The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would start from
London at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at what time
to expect them, according to where we were, and would hail the first
so that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we should have
another chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel.
 
The relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose
was so great to me that I felt it difficult to realize the condition in
which I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, the
movement on the river, and the moving river itself,the road that ran
with us, seeming to sympathize with us, animate us, and encourage us
on,freshened me with new hope. I felt mortified to be of so little use
in the boat but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends, and
they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.
 
At that time, the steamtraffic on the Thames was far below its present
extent, and watermens boats were far more numerous. Of barges, sailing
colliers, and coastingtraders, there were perhaps, as many as now
but of steamships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part
so many. Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here and
there that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide
the navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was a much
easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these and we
went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.
 
Old London Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate Market with its
oysterboats and Dutchmen, and the White Tower and Traitors Gate, and
we were in among the tiers of shipping. Here were the Leith, Aberdeen,
and Glasgow steamers, loading and unloading goods, and looking immensely
high out of the water as we passed alongside here, were colliers by the
score and score, with the coalwhippers plunging off stages on deck, as
counterweights to measures of coal swinging up, which were then rattled
over the side into barges here, at her moorings was tomorrows steamer
for Rotterdam, of which we took good notice and here tomorrows for
Hamburg, under whose bowsprit we crossed. And now I, sitting in the
stern, could see, with a faster beating heart, Mill Pond Bank and Mill
Pond stairs.
 
"Is he there?" said Herbert.
 
"Not yet."
 
"Right! He was not to come down till he saw us. Can you see his signal?"
 
"Not well from here but I think I see it.Now I see him! Pull both.
Easy, Herbert. Oars!"
 
We touched the stairs lightly for a single moment, and he was on board,
and we were off again. He had a boatcloak with him, and a black canvas
bag and he looked as like a riverpilot as my heart could have wished.
 
"Dear boy!" he said, putting his arm on my shoulder, as he took his
seat. "Faithful dear boy, well done. Thankye, thankye!"
 
Again among the tiers of shipping, in and out, avoiding rusty
chaincables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys, sinking for the
moment floating broken baskets, scattering floating chips of wood
and shaving, cleaving floating scum of coal, in and out, under the
figurehead of the John of Sunderland making a speech to the winds as
is done by many Johns, and the Betsy of Yarmouth with a firm formality
of bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of her head in
and out, hammers going in shipbuilders yards, saws going at timber,
clashing engines going at things unknown, pumps going in leaky ships,
capstans going, ships going out to sea, and unintelligible seacreatures
roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent lightermen, in and
out,out at last upon the clearer river, where the ships boys might
take their fenders in, no longer fishing in troubled waters with them
over the side, and where the festooned sails might fly out to the wind.
 
At the Stairs where we had taken him abroad, and ever since, I had
looked warily for any token of our being suspected. I had seen none. We
certainly had not been, and at that time as certainly we were not either
attended or followed by any boat. If we had been waited on by any boat,
I should have run in to shore, and have obliged her to go on, or to
make her purpose evident. But we held our own without any appearance of
molestation.
 
He had his boatcloak on him, and looked, as I have said, a natural part
of the scene. It was remarkable but perhaps the wretched life he had
led accounted for it that he was the least anxious of any of us. He
was not indifferent, for he told me that he hoped to live to see his
gentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country he was not
disposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it but he had no
notion of meeting danger half way. When it came upon him, he confronted
it, but it must come before he troubled himself.
 
"If you knowed, dear boy," he said to me, "what it is to sit here
alonger my dear boy and have my smoke, arter having been day by day
betwixt four walls, youd envy me. But you dont know what it is."
 
"I think I know the delights of freedom," I answered.
 
"Ah," said he, shaking his head gravely. "But you dont know it equal to
me. You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to know it equal to
me,but I aint a going to be low."
 
It occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, he
should have endangered his freedom, and even his life. But I reflected
that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the
habit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man. I
was not far out, since he said, after smoking a little
 
"You see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, tother side the world, I
was always a looking to this side and it come flat to be there, for
all I was a growing rich. Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch could
come, and Magwitch could go, and nobodys head would be troubled about
him. They aint so easy concerning me here, dear boy,wouldnt be,
leastwise, if they knowed where I was."
 
"If all goes well," said I, "you will be perfectly free and safe again
within a few hours."
 
"Well," he returned, drawing a long breath, "I hope so."
 
"And think so?"
 
He dipped his hand in the water over the boats gunwale, and said,
smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me
 
"Ay, I spose I think so, dear boy. Wed be puzzled to be more quiet
and easygoing than we are at present. Butits a flowing so soft
and pleasant through the water, praps, as makes me think itI was
a thinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to the
bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river
what I catches hold of. Nor yet we cant no more hold their tide than
I can hold this. And its run through my fingers and gone, you see!"
holding up his dripping hand.
 
"But for your face I should think you were a little despondent," said I.
 
"Not a bit on it, dear boy! It comes of flowing on so quiet, and of that
there rippling at the boats head making a sort of a Sunday tune. Maybe
Im a growing a trifle old besides."
 
He put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of
face, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of
England. Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been
in constant terror for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer
into the boat, and he was stepping out, I hinted that I thought he would
be safest where he was, and he said. "Do you, dear boy?" and quietly sat
down again.
 
The air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and the
sunshine was very cheering. The tide ran strong, I took care to lose
none of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well. By
imperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more of the
nearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between the muddy
banks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend. As our
charge was wrapped in his cloak, I purposely passed within a boat or
twos length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catch the
stream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of a large
transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us. And soon
the tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at anchor to swing,
and presently they had all swung round, and the ships that were taking
advantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon us
in a fleet, and we kept under the shore, as much out of the strength of
the tide now as we could, standing carefully off from low shallows and
mudbanks.
 
Our oarsmen were so fresh, by dint of having occasionally let her drive
with the tide for a minute or two, that a quarter of an hours rest
proved full as much as they wanted. We got ashore among some slippery
stones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and looked about.
It was like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a
dim horizon while the winding river turned and turned, and the great
floating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemed
stranded and still. For now the last of the fleet of ships was round
the last low point we had headed and the last green barge, strawladen,
with a brown sail, had followed and some ballastlighters, shaped like
a childs first rude imitation of a boat, lay low in the mud and a
little squat shoallighthouse on open piles stood crippled in the mud
on stilts and crutches and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud, and slimy
stones stuck out of the mud, and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck
out of the mud, and an old landingstage and an old roofless building
slipped into the mud, and all about us was stagnation and mud.
 
We pushed off again, and made what way we could. It was much harder work
now, but Herbert and Startop persevered, and rowed and rowed and rowed
until the sun went down. By that time the river had lifted us a little,
so that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, on the low
level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into black and
there was the solitary flat marsh and far away there were the rising
grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life, save here and
there in the foreground a melancholy gull.
 
As the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full,
would not rise early, we held a little council a short one, for clearly
our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find. So,
they plied their oars once more, and I looked out for anything like a
house. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or five dull miles. It
was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with her galleyfire smoking
and flaring, looked like a comfortable home. The night was as dark by
this time as it would be until morning and what light we had, seemed
to come more from the river than the sky, as the oars in their dipping
struck at a few reflected stars.
 
At this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that
we were followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular
intervals against the shore and whenever such a sound came, one or
other of us was sure to start, and look in that direction. Here and
there, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little
creek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them
nervously. Sometimes, "What was that ripple?" one of us would say in a
low voice. Or another, "Is that a boat yonder?" And afterwards we would
fall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with what
an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.
 
At length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ran
alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard
by. Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light
to be in a window of a publichouse. It was a dirty place enough, and I
dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers but there was a good
fire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various
liquors to drink. Also, there were two doublebedded rooms,"such as
they were," the landlord said. No other company was in the house than
the landlord, his wife, and a grizzled male creature, the "Jack" of the
little causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been lowwater
mark too.
 
With this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all came
ashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder and boathook, and all
else, and hauled her up for the night. We made a very good meal by the
kitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms Herbert and Startop
were to occupy one I and our charge the other. We found the air as
carefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life and there
were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have
thought the family possessed. But we considered ourselves well off,
notwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found.
 
While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the
Jackwho was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoes
on, which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, as
interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of
a drowned seaman washed ashoreasked me if we had seen a fouroared
galley going up with the tide? When I told him No, he said she must have
gone down then, and yet she "took up too," when she left there.
 
"They must ha thought better ont for some reason or another," said the
Jack, "and gone down."
 
"A fouroared galley, did you say?" said I.
 
"A four," said the Jack, "and two sitters."
 
"Did they come ashore here?"
 
"They put in with a stone twogallon jar for some beer. Id ha been
glad to pison the beer myself," said the Jack, "or put some rattling
physic in it."
 
"Why?"
 
"I know why," said the Jack. He spoke in a slushy voice, as if much mud
had washed into his throat.
 
"He thinks," said the landlord, a weakly meditative man with a pale eye,
who seemed to rely greatly on his Jack,"he thinks they was, what they
wasnt."
 
"I knows what I thinks," observed the Jack.
 
"You thinks Custum Us, Jack?" said the landlord.
 
"I do," said the Jack.
 
"Then youre wrong, Jack."
 
"AM I!"
 
In the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in
his views, the Jack took one of his bloated shoes off, looked into
it, knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor, and put it on
again. He did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that he could
afford to do anything.
 
"Why, what do you make out that they done with their buttons then,
Jack?" asked the landlord, vacillating weakly.
 
"Done with their buttons?" returned the Jack. "Chucked em overboard.
Swallered em. Sowed em, to come up small salad. Done with their
buttons!"
 
"Dont be cheeky, Jack," remonstrated the landlord, in a melancholy and
pathetic way.
 
"A Custum Us officer knows what to do with his Buttons," said the Jack,
repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt, "when they
comes betwixt him and his own light. A four and two sitters dont go
hanging and hovering, up with one tide and down with another, and both
with and against another, without there being Custum Us at the bottom
of it." Saying which he went out in disdain and the landlord, having no
one to reply upon, found it impracticable to pursue the subject.
 
This dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy. The dismal wind
was muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, and
I had a feeling that we were caged and threatened. A fouroared galley
hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly
circumstance that I could not get rid of. When I had induced Provis to
go up to bed, I went outside with my two companions Startop by this
time knew the state of the case, and held another council. Whether we
should remain at the house until near the steamers time, which would
be about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put off early in the
morning, was the question we discussed. On the whole we deemed it the
better course to lie where we were, until within an hour or so of the
steamers time, and then to get out in her track, and drift easily with
the tide. Having settled to do this, we returned into the house and went
to bed.
 
I lay down with the greater part of my clothes on, and slept well for a
few hours. When I awoke, the wind had risen, and the sign of the house
the Ship was creaking and banging about, with noises that startled
me. Rising softly, for my charge lay fast asleep, I looked out of the
window. It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat, and,
as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon, I saw
two men looking into her. They passed by under the window, looking at
nothing else, and they did not go down to the landingplace which I
could discern to be empty, but struck across the marsh in the direction
of the Nore.
 
My first impulse was to call up Herbert, and show him the two men going
away. But reflecting, before I got into his room, which was at the back
of the house and adjoined mine, that he and Startop had had a harder day
than I, and were fatigued, I forbore. Going back to my window, I could
see the two men moving over the marsh. In that light, however, I soon
lost them, and, feeling very cold, lay down to think of the matter, and
fell asleep again.
 
We were up early. As we walked to and fro, all four together, before
breakfast, I deemed it right to recount what I had seen. Again our
charge was the least anxious of the party. It was very likely that the
men belonged to the Custom House, he said quietly, and that they had no
thought of us. I tried to persuade myself that it was so,as, indeed,
it might easily be. However, I proposed that he and I should walk away
together to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should take
us aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at about
noon. This being considered a good precaution, soon after breakfast he
and I set forth, without saying anything at the tavern.
 
He smoked his pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap me on
the shoulder. One would have supposed that it was I who was in danger,
not he, and that he was reassuring me. We spoke very little. As we
approached the point, I begged him to remain in a sheltered place, while
I went on to reconnoitre for it was towards it that the men had passed
in the night. He complied, and I went on alone. There was no boat off
the point, nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it, nor were there any
signs of the men having embarked there. But, to be sure, the tide was
high, and there might have been some footpints under water.
 
When he looked out from his shelter in the distance, and saw that I
waved my hat to him to come up, he rejoined me, and there we waited
sometimes lying on the bank, wrapped in our coats, and sometimes moving
about to warm ourselves, until we saw our boat coming round. We got
aboard easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer. By that time
it wanted but ten minutes of one oclock, and we began to look out for
her smoke.
 
But, it was halfpast one before we saw her smoke, and soon afterwards
we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they were coming on
at full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity
of saying good by to Herbert and Startop. We had all shaken hands
cordially, and neither Herberts eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I
saw a fouroared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way
ahead of us, and row out into the same track.
 
A stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamers smoke,
by reason of the bend and wind of the river but now she was visible,
coming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the tide,
that she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured Provis to sit
quite still, wrapped in his cloak. He answered cheerily, "Trust to me,
dear boy," and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was very
skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her, and fallen
alongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars, she kept
alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or two when we
pulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudderlines, and looked at us
attentively,as did all the rowers the other sitter was wrapped up,
much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some instruction
to the steerer as he looked at us. Not a word was spoken in either boat.
 
Startop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,
and gave me the word "Hamburg," in a low voice, as we sat face to face.
She was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grew louder
and louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us, when the
galley hailed us. I answered.
 
"You have a returned Transport there," said the man who held the lines.
"Thats the man, wrapped in the cloak. His name is Abel Magwitch,
otherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him to surrender,
and you to assist."
 
At the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew,
he ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke ahead,
had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on to
our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great
confusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and
heard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but felt
her driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw the
steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoners shoulder, and saw
that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide, and
saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite
frantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start
up, lean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the
shrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that the
face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago. Still, in
the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it
that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board the steamer,
and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink from under me.
 
It was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand
millweirs and a thousand flashes of light that instant past, I was
taken on board the galley. Herbert was there, and Startop was there but
our boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.
 
What with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off of
her steam, and her driving on, and our driving on, I could not at first
distinguish sky from water or shore from shore but the crew of the
galley righted her with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strong
strokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently and
eagerly at the water astern. Presently a dark object was seen in it,
bearing towards us on the tide. No man spoke, but the steersman held up
his hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight and
true before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming,
but not swimming freely. He was taken on board, and instantly manacled
at the wrists and ankles.
 
The galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager lookout at the water
was resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not
understanding what had happened, came on at speed. By the time she had
been hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, and
we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water. The lookout was
kept, long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone but
everybody knew that it was hopeless now.
 
At length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavern
we had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise. Here
I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,Provis no longer,who
had received some very severe injury in the Chest, and a deep cut in the
head.
 
He told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the
steamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising. The injury to
his chest which rendered his breathing extremely painful he thought
he had received against the side of the galley. He added that he did not
pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson, but
that, in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him,
that villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had both gone
overboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him Magwitch out of
our boat, and the endeavor of his captor to keep him in it, had capsized
us. He told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in
each others arms, and that there had been a struggle under water, and
that he had disengaged himself, struck out, and swum away.
 
I never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me.
The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going
overboard.
 
When I asked this officers permission to change the prisoners
wet clothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the
publichouse, he gave it readily merely observing that he must take
charge of everything his prisoner had about him. So the pocketbook
which had once been in my hands passed into the officers. He further
gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London but declined to
accord that grace to my two friends.
 
The Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone
down, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was
likeliest to come ashore. His interest in its recovery seemed to me to
be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on. Probably, it
took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely and that may
have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in
various stages of decay.
 
We remained at the publichouse until the tide turned, and then Magwitch
was carried down to the galley and put on board. Herbert and Startop
were to get to London by land, as soon as they could. We had a doleful
parting, and when I took my place by Magwitchs side, I felt that that
was my place henceforth while he lived.
 
For now, my repugnance to him had all melted away and in the hunted,
wounded, shackled creature who held my hand in his, I only saw a man
who had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt affectionately,
gratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through a
series of years. I only saw in him a much better man than I had been to
Joe.
 
His breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on,
and often he could not repress a groan. I tried to rest him on the arm
I could use, in any easy position but it was dreadful to think that
I could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt, since it was
unquestionably best that he should die. That there were, still living,
people enough who were able and willing to identify him, I could not
doubt. That he would be leniently treated, I could not hope. He who had
been presented in the worst light at his trial, who had since broken
prison and had been tried again, who had returned from transportation
under a life sentence, and who had occasioned the death of the man who
was the cause of his arrest.
 
As we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us,
and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back, I told him how
grieved I was to think that he had come home for my sake.
 
"Dear boy," he answered, "Im quite content to take my chance. Ive seen
my boy, and he can be a gentleman without me."
 
No. I had thought about that, while we had been there side by side. No.
Apart from any inclinations of my own, I understood Wemmicks hint now.
I foresaw that, being convicted, his possessions would be forfeited to
the Crown.
 
"Lookee here, dear boy," said he "Its best as a gentleman should not be
knowed to belong to me now. Only come to see me as if you come by chance
alonger Wemmick. Sit where I can see you when I am swore to, for the
last o many times, and I dont ask no more."
 
"I will never stir from your side," said I, "when I am suffered to be
near you. Please God, I will be as true to you as you have been to me!"
 
I felt his hand tremble as it held mine, and he turned his face away
as he lay in the bottom of the boat, and I heard that old sound in his
throat,softened now, like all the rest of him. It was a good thing
that he had touched this point, for it put into my mind what I might not
otherwise have thought of until too late,that he need never know how
his hopes of enriching me had perished.
 
 
 
 
Chapter LV
 
He was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have been
immediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send down
for an old officer of the prisonship from which he had once escaped, to
speak to his identity. Nobody doubted it but Compeyson, who had meant
to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened that
there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could give
the required evidence. I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his private
house, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and Mr.
Jaggers on the prisoners behalf would admit nothing. It was the sole
resource for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes
when the witness was there, and that no power on earth could prevent its
going against us.
 
I imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the
fate of his wealth. Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for
having "let it slip through my fingers," and said we must memorialize
by and by, and try at all events for some of it. But he did not conceal
from me that, although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture
would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this case to make
it one of them. I understood that very well. I was not related to the
outlaw, or connected with him by any recognizable tie he had put his
hand to no writing or settlement in my favor before his apprehension,
and to do so now would be idle. I had no claim, and I finally resolved,
and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my heart should never
be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one.
 
There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer
had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some
accurate knowledge of Magwitchs affairs. When his body was found, many
miles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that he
was only recognizable by the contents of his pockets, notes were still
legible, folded in a case he carried. Among these were the name of a
bankinghouse in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the
designation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of
information were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.
Jaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit. His ignorance,
poor fellow, at last served him he never mistrusted but that my
inheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggerss aid.
 
After three days delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over
for the production of the witness from the prisonship, the witness
came, and completed the easy case. He was committed to take his trial at
the next Sessions, which would come on in a month.
 
It was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one
evening, a good deal cast down, and said,
 
"My dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you."
 
His partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised than he
thought.
 
"We shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo, and I am
very much afraid I must go, Handel, when you most need me."
 
"Herbert, I shall always need you, because I shall always love you but
my need is no greater now than at another time."
 
"You will be so lonely."
 
"I have not leisure to think of that," said I. "You know that I am
always with him to the full extent of the time allowed, and that I
should be with him all day long, if I could. And when I come away from
him, you know that my thoughts are with him."
 
The dreadful condition to which he was brought, was so appalling to both
of us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words.
 
"My dear fellow," said Herbert, "let the near prospect of our
separationfor, it is very nearbe my justification for troubling you
about yourself. Have you thought of your future?"
 
"No, for I have been afraid to think of any future."
 
"But yours cannot be dismissed indeed, my dear dear Handel, it must not
be dismissed. I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a few friendly
words go, with me."
 
"I will," said I.
 
"In this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a"
 
I saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, "A
clerk."
 
"A clerk. And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand as
a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded into a partner. Now,
Handel,in short, my dear boy, will you come to me?"
 
There was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in
which after saying "Now, Handel," as if it were the grave beginning of
a portentous business exordium, he had suddenly given up that tone,
stretched out his honest hand, and spoken like a schoolboy.
 
"Clara and I have talked about it again and again," Herbert pursued,
"and the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears in
her eyes, to say to you that, if you will live with us when we come
together, she will do her best to make you happy, and to convince her
husbands friend that he is her friend too. We should get on so well,
Handel!"
 
I thanked her heartily, and I thanked him heartily, but said I could not
yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered. Firstly, my
mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly.
Secondly,Yes! Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in my
thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative.
 
"But if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing any injury
to your business, leave the question open for a little while"
 
"For any while," cried Herbert. "Six months, a year!"
 
"Not so long as that," said I. "Two or three months at most."
 
Herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement,
and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must
go away at the end of the week.
 
"And Clara?" said I.
 
"The dear little thing," returned Herbert, "holds dutifully to her
father as long as he lasts but he wont last long. Mrs. Whimple
confides to me that he is certainly going."
 
"Not to say an unfeeling thing," said I, "he cannot do better than go."
 
"I am afraid that must be admitted," said Herbert "and then I shall
come back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and I
will walk quietly into the nearest church. Remember! The blessed darling
comes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into the red book,
and hasnt a notion about her grandpapa. What a fortune for the son of
my mother!"
 
On the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert,full
of bright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me,as he sat on one of the
seaport mail coaches. I went into a coffeehouse to write a little note
to Clara, telling her he had gone off, sending his love to her over and
over again, and then went to my lonely home,if it deserved the name
for it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere.
 
On the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, after an
unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door. I had not seen him
alone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight and he had
come, in his private and personal capacity, to say a few words of
explanation in reference to that failure.
 
"The late Compeyson," said Wemmick, "had by little and little got at the
bottom of half of the regular business now transacted and it was from
the talk of some of his people in trouble some of his people being
always in trouble that I heard what I did. I kept my ears open, seeming
to have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and I thought that
would be the best time for making the attempt. I can only suppose now,
that it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man, habitually to
deceive his own instruments. You dont blame me, I hope, Mr. Pip? I am
sure I tried to serve you, with all my heart."
 
"I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most
earnestly for all your interest and friendship."
 
"Thank you, thank you very much. Its a bad job," said Wemmick,
scratching his head, "and I assure you I havent been so cut up for a
long time. What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable property.
Dear me!"
 
"What I think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property."
 
"Yes, to be sure," said Wemmick. "Of course, there can be no objection
to your being sorry for him, and Id put down a fivepound note myself
to get him out of it. But what I look at is this. The late Compeyson
having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, and being
so determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could have been
saved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been saved.
Thats the difference between the property and the owner, dont you
see?"
 
I invited Wemmick to come up stairs, and refresh himself with a glass
of grog before walking to Walworth. He accepted the invitation. While he
was drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead up to
it, and after having appeared rather fidgety,
 
"What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?"
 
"Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months."
 
"These twelve years, more likely," said Wemmick. "Yes. Im going to take
a holiday. More than that Im going to take a walk. More than that Im
going to ask you to take a walk with me."
 
I was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then,
when Wemmick anticipated me.
 
"I know your engagements," said he, "and I know you are out of sorts,
Mr. Pip. But if you could oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.
It aint a long walk, and its an early one. Say it might occupy you
including breakfast on the walk from eight to twelve. Couldnt you
stretch a point and manage it?"
 
He had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little
to do for him. I said I could manage it,would manage it,and he was
so very much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too. At his
particular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half
past eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.
 
Punctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday
morning, and was received by Wemmick himself, who struck me as looking
tighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on. Within, there were two
glasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits. The Aged must have
been stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of his
bedroom, I observed that his bed was empty.
 
When we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, and
were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was
considerably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishingrod, and put
it over his shoulder. "Why, we are not going fishing!" said I. "No,"
returned Wemmick, "but I like to walk with one."
 
I thought this odd however, I said nothing, and we set off. We went
towards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said
suddenly,
 
"Halloa! Heres a church!"
 
There was nothing very surprising in that but again, I was rather
surprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea,
 
"Lets go in!"
 
We went in, Wemmick leaving his fishingrod in the porch, and looked all
round. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his coatpockets, and
getting something out of paper there.
 
"Halloa!" said he. "Heres a couple of pair of gloves! Lets put em
on!"
 
As the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the postoffice was widened
to its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. They
were strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side
door, escorting a lady.
 
"Halloa!" said Wemmick. "Heres Miss Skiffins! Lets have a wedding."
 
That discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was now
engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white. The
Aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for
the altar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, experienced so much
difficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary
to put him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind the
pillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old
gentleman round the waist, that he might present an equal and safe
resistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on to
perfection.
 
The clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at
those fatal rails. True to his notion of seeming to do it all without
preparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he took something out of
his waistcoatpocket before the service began, "Halloa! Heres a ring!"
 
I acted in the capacity of backer, or bestman, to the bridegroom while
a little limp pewopener in a soft bonnet like a babys, made a feint
of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility of giving
the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the clergymans being
unintentionally scandalized, and it happened thus. When he said, "Who
giveth this woman to be married to this man?" the old gentlemen, not in
the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at, stood
most amiably beaming at the ten commandments. Upon which, the clergyman
said again, "WHO giveth this woman to be married to this man?" The old
gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness, the
bridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice, "Now Aged P. you know who
giveth?" To which the Aged replied with great briskness, before saying
that he gave, "All right, John, all right, my boy!" And the clergyman
came to so gloomy a pause upon it, that I had doubts for the moment
whether we should get completely married that day.
 
It was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church
Wemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it, and
put the cover on again. Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future, put
her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green. "Now, Mr. Pip,"
said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishingrod as we came
out, "let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a
weddingparty!"
 
Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so
away upon the rising ground beyond the green and there was a bagatelle
board in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after
the solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer
unwound Wemmicks arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat in a
highbacked chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case, and
submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done.
 
We had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on
table, Wemmick said, "Provided by contract, you know dont be afraid of
it!" I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the Castle,
saluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I could.
 
Wemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with him,
and wished him joy.
 
"Thankee!" said Wemmick, rubbing his hands. "Shes such a manager
of fowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge for
yourself. I say, Mr. Pip!" calling me back, and speaking low. "This is
altogether a Walworth sentiment, please."
 
"I understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain," said I.
 
Wemmick nodded. "After what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers
may as well not know of it. He might think my brain was softening, or
something of the kind."
 
 
 
 
Chapter LVI
 
He lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between his
committal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions. He had broken
two ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with great
pain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of his
hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible therefore he spoke
very little. But he was ever ready to listen to me and it became the
first duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew he
ought to hear.
 
Being far too ill to remain in the common prison, he was removed, after
the first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me opportunities
of being with him that I could not otherwise have had. And but for
his illness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as a
determined prisonbreaker, and I know not what else.
 
Although I saw him every day, it was for only a short time hence, the
regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record
on his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state. I
do not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better he
wasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day
when the prison door closed upon him.
 
The kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man
who was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from his manner
or from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he pondered
over the question whether he might have been a better man under better
circumstances. But he never justified himself by a hint tending that
way, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.
 
It happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his desperate
reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on
him. A smile crossed his face then, and he turned his eyes on me with
a trustful look, as if he were confident that I had seen some small
redeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I was a little child.
As to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, and I never knew him
complain.
 
When the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application to be
made for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions. It
was obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long,
and was refused. The trial came on at once, and, when he was put to the
bar, he was seated in a chair. No objection was made to my getting
close to the dock, on the outside of it, and holding the hand that he
stretched forth to me.
 
The trial was very short and very clear. Such things as could be said
for him were said,how he had taken to industrious habits, and had
thriven lawfully and reputably. But nothing could unsay the fact that
he had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury. It was
impossible to try him for that, and do otherwise than find him guilty.
 
At that time, it was the custom as I learnt from my terrible experience
of that Sessions to devote a concluding day to the passing of
Sentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of Death.
But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me,
I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that I saw
twoandthirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that
sentence together. Foremost among the twoandthirty was he seated,
that he might get breath enough to keep life in him.
 
The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colors of the moment, down
to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering in
the rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside it
at the corner with his hand in mine, were the twoandthirty men
and women some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and
weeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. There
had been shrieks from among the women convicts but they had been
stilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains
and nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great
gallery full of people,a large theatrical audience,looked on, as the
twoandthirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge
addressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must
single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had
been an offender against the laws who, after repeated imprisonments and
punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years
and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had made his
escape and been resentenced to exile for life. That miserable man would
seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when far removed
from the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a peaceable and
honest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those propensities and
passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to
society, he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance, and had
come back to the country where he was proscribed. Being here presently
denounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of
Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of flight, he had
resisted them, and hadhe best knew whether by express design, or in
the blindness of his hardihoodcaused the death of his denouncer, to
whom his whole career was known. The appointed punishment for his return
to the land that had cast him out, being Death, and his case being this
aggravated case, he must prepare himself to Die.
 
The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the
glittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of
light between the twoandthirty and the Judge, linking both together,
and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,
with absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all things,
and cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face in this
way of light, the prisoner said, "My Lord, I have received my sentence
of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours," and sat down again.
There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had to say
to the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some of them were
supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of
bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three shook hands,
and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from
the sweet herbs lying about. He went last of all, because of having to
be helped from his chair, and to go very slowly and he held my hand
while all the others were removed, and while the audience got up
putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere, and
pointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at him and me.
 
I earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Recorders
Report was made but, in the dread of his lingering on, I began that
night to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State, setting
forth my knowledge of him, and how it was that he had come back for my
sake. I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could and when I
had finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such men
in authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to the
Crown itself. For several days and nights after he was sentenced I took
no rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbed
in these appeals. And after I had sent them in, I could not keep away
from the places where they were, but felt as if they were more
hopeful and less desperate when I was near them. In this unreasonable
restlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening,
wandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions. To
the present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold, dusty
spring night, with their ranges of stern, shutup mansions, and their
long rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association.
 
The daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he was more
strictly kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an intention
of carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before I sat down
at his bedside, and told the officer who was always there, that I was
willing to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my
designs. Nobody was hard with him or with me. There was duty to be
done, and it was done, but not harshly. The officer always gave me the
assurance that he was worse, and some other sick prisoners in the
room, and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses,
malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be thanked! always
joined in the same report.
 
As the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly
looking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his face
until some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would
subside again. Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak, then
he would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew to
understand his meaning very well.
 
The number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change
in him than I had seen yet. His eyes were turned towards the door, and
lighted up as I entered.
 
"Dear boy," he said, as I sat down by his bed "I thought you was late.
But I knowed you couldnt be that."
 
"It is just the time," said I. "I waited for it at the gate."
 
"You always waits at the gate dont you, dear boy?"
 
"Yes. Not to lose a moment of the time."
 
"Thankee dear boy, thankee. God bless you! Youve never deserted me,
dear boy."
 
I pressed his hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once
meant to desert him.
 
"And whats the best of all," he said, "youve been more comfortable
alonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone.
Thats best of all."
 
He lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what he would,
and love me though he did, the light left his face ever and again, and a
film came over the placid look at the white ceiling.
 
"Are you in much pain today?"
 
"I dont complain of none, dear boy."
 
"You never do complain."
 
He had spoken his last words. He smiled, and I understood his touch to
mean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast. I laid it
there, and he smiled again, and put both his hands upon it.
 
The allotted time ran out, while we were thus but, looking round, I
found the governor of the prison standing near me, and he whispered,
"You neednt go yet." I thanked him gratefully, and asked, "Might I
speak to him, if he can hear me?"
 
The governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The change,
though it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placid
look at the white ceiling, and he looked most affectionately at me.
 
"Dear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last. You understand what I
say?"
 
A gentle pressure on my hand.
 
"You had a child once, whom you loved and lost."
 
A stronger pressure on my hand.
 
"She lived, and found powerful friends. She is living now. She is a lady
and very beautiful. And I love her!"
 
With a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for my
yielding to it and assisting it, he raised my hand to his lips. Then,
he gently let it sink upon his breast again, with his own hands lying on
it. The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away, and
his head dropped quietly on his breast.
 
Mindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men
who went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better
words that I could say beside his bed, than "O Lord, be merciful to him
a sinner!"
 
 
 
 
Chapter LVII
 
Now that I was left wholly to myself, I gave notice of my intention
to quit the chambers in the Temple as soon as my tenancy could legally
determine, and in the meanwhile to underlet them. At once I put bills
up in the windows for, I was in debt, and had scarcely any money, and
began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs. I ought
rather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and
concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth
beyond the fact that I was falling very ill. The late stress upon me had
enabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away I knew that it
was coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and was even careless
as to that.
 
For a day or two, I lay on the sofa, or on the floor,anywhere,
according as I happened to sink down,with a heavy head and aching
limbs, and no purpose, and no power. Then there came, one night which
appeared of great duration, and which teemed with anxiety and horror
and when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it, I
found I could not do so.
 
Whether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of the night,
groping about for the boat that I supposed to be there whether I had
two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror,
not knowing how I had got out of bed whether I had found myself
lighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he was coming up
the stairs, and that the lights were blown out whether I had been
inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, and groaning
of some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making
whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of
the room, and a voice had called out, over and over again, that Miss
Havisham was consuming within it,these were things that I tried to
settle with myself and get into some order, as I lay that morning on
my bed. But the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them,
disordering them all, and it was through the vapor at last that I saw
two men looking at me.
 
"What do you want?" I asked, starting "I dont know you."
 
"Well, sir," returned one of them, bending down and touching me on the
shoulder, "this is a matter that youll soon arrange, I dare say, but
youre arrested."
 
"What is the debt?"
 
"Hundred and twentythree pound, fifteen, six. Jewellers account, I
think."
 
"What is to be done?"
 
"You had better come to my house," said the man. "I keep a very nice
house."
 
I made some attempt to get up and dress myself. When I next attended
to them, they were standing a little off from the bed, looking at me. I
still lay there.
 
"You see my state," said I. "I would come with you if I could but
indeed I am quite unable. If you take me from here, I think I shall die
by the way."
 
Perhaps they replied, or argued the point, or tried to encourage me to
believe that I was better than I thought. Forasmuch as they hang in
my memory by only this one slender thread, I dont know what they did,
except that they forbore to remove me.
 
That I had a fever and was avoided, that I suffered greatly, that
I often lost my reason, that the time seemed interminable, that I
confounded impossible existences with my own identity that I was a
brick in the housewall, and yet entreating to be released from the
giddy place where the builders had set me that I was a steel beam of a
vast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf, and yet that I implored
in my own person to have the engine stopped, and my part in it hammered
off that I passed through these phases of disease, I know of my own
remembrance, and did in some sort know at the time. That I sometimes
struggled with real people, in the belief that they were murderers, and
that I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good, and
would then sink exhausted in their arms, and suffer them to lay me
down, I also knew at the time. But, above all, I knew that there was a
constant tendency in all these people,who, when I was very ill, would
present all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face,
and would be much dilated in size,above all, I say, I knew that there
was an extraordinary tendency in all these people, sooner or later, to
settle down into the likeness of Joe.
 
After I had turned the worst point of my illness, I began to notice that
while all its other features changed, this one consistent feature did
not change. Whoever came about me, still settled down into Joe. I opened
my eyes in the night, and I saw, in the great chair at the bedside, Joe.
I opened my eyes in the day, and, sitting on the windowseat, smoking
his pipe in the shaded open window, still I saw Joe. I asked for cooling
drink, and the dear hand that gave it me was Joes. I sank back on
my pillow after drinking, and the face that looked so hopefully and
tenderly upon me was the face of Joe.
 
At last, one day, I took courage, and said, "Is it Joe?"
 
And the dear old homevoice answered, "Which it air, old chap."
 
"O Joe, you break my heart! Look angry at me, Joe. Strike me, Joe. Tell
me of my ingratitude. Dont be so good to me!"
 
For Joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side, and
put his arm round my neck, in his joy that I knew him.
 
"Which dear old Pip, old chap," said Joe, "you and me was ever friends.
And when youre well enough to go out for a ridewhat larks!"
 
After which, Joe withdrew to the window, and stood with his back towards
me, wiping his eyes. And as my extreme weakness prevented me from
getting up and going to him, I lay there, penitently whispering, "O God
bless him! O God bless this gentle Christian man!"
 
Joes eyes were red when I next found him beside me but I was holding
his hand, and we both felt happy.
 
"How long, dear Joe?"
 
"Which you meantersay, Pip, how long have your illness lasted, dear old
chap?"
 
"Yes, Joe."
 
"Its the end of May, Pip. Tomorrow is the first of June."
 
"And have you been here all that time, dear Joe?"
 
"Pretty nigh, old chap. For, as I says to Biddy when the news of your
being ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the post, and
being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal of
walking and shoeleather, but wealth were not a object on his part, and
marriage were the great wish of his hart"
 
"It is so delightful to hear you, Joe! But I interrupt you in what you
said to Biddy."
 
"Which it were," said Joe, "that how you might be amongst strangers, and
that how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit at such a moment
might not prove unacceptabobble. And Biddy, her word were, Go to him,
without loss of time. That," said Joe, summing up with his judicial
air, "were the word of Biddy. Go to him, Biddy say, without loss of
time. In short, I shouldnt greatly deceive you," Joe added, after a
little grave reflection, "if I represented to you that the word of that
young woman were, without a minutes loss of time."
 
There Joe cut himself short, and informed me that I was to be talked
to in great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment at
stated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and that
I was to submit myself to all his orders. So I kissed his hand, and lay
quiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in it.
 
Evidently Biddy had taught Joe to write. As I lay in bed looking at him,
it made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see the
pride with which he set about his letter. My bedstead, divested of its
curtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sittingroom, as
the airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and
the room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day. At my own
writingtable, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles,
Joe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from the
pentray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up his
sleeves as if he were going to wield a crowbar or sledgehammer. It was
necessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow,
and to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin and
when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might
have been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear his pen
spluttering extensively. He had a curious idea that the inkstand was
on the side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen into
space, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, he was
tripped up by some orthographical stumblingblock but on the whole
he got on very well indeed and when he had signed his name, and had
removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with
his two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying the
effect of his performance from various points of view, as it lay there,
with unbounded satisfaction.
 
Not to make Joe uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been able to
talk much, I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until next day. He
shook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered.
 
"Is she dead, Joe?"
 
"Why you see, old chap," said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and by way
of getting at it by degrees, "I wouldnt go so far as to say that, for
thats a deal to say but she aint"
 
"Living, Joe?"
 
"Thats nigher where it is," said Joe "she aint living."
 
"Did she linger long, Joe?"
 
"Arter you was took ill, pretty much about what you might call if you
was put to it a week," said Joe still determined, on my account, to
come at everything by degrees.
 
"Dear Joe, have you heard what becomes of her property?"
 
"Well, old chap," said Joe, "it do appear that she had settled the most
of it, which I meantersay tied it up, on Miss Estella. But she had
wrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the
accident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket. And why,
do you suppose, above all things, Pip, she left that cool four thousand
unto him? Because of Pips account of him, the said Matthew. I am told
by Biddy, that air the writing," said Joe, repeating the legal turn as
if it did him infinite good, "account of him the said Matthew. And a
cool four thousand, Pip!"
 
I never discovered from whom Joe derived the conventional temperature of
the four thousand pounds but it appeared to make the sum of money more
to him, and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being cool.
 
This account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing I
had done. I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the other relations
had any legacies?
 
"Miss Sarah," said Joe, "she have twentyfive pound perannium fur to
buy pills, on account of being bilious. Miss Georgiana, she have twenty
pound down. Mrs.whats the name of them wild beasts with humps, old
chap?"
 
"Camels?" said I, wondering why he could possibly want to know.
 
Joe nodded. "Mrs. Camels," by which I presently understood he meant
Camilla, "she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in
spirits when she wake up in the night."
 
The accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to give
me great confidence in Joes information. "And now," said Joe, "you
aint that strong yet, old chap, that you can take in more nor one
additional shovelful today. Old Orlick hes been a bustin open a
dwellingouse."
 
"Whose?" said I.
 
"Not, I grant you, but what his manners is given to blusterous," said
Joe, apologetically "still, a Englishmans ouse is his Castle, and
castles must not be busted cept when done in war time. And wotsumeer
the failings on his part, he were a corn and seedsman in his hart."
 
"Is it Pumblechooks house that has been broken into, then?"
 
"Thats it, Pip," said Joe "and they took his till, and they took his
cashbox, and they drinked his wine, and they partook of his wittles,
and they slapped his face, and they pulled his nose, and they tied him
up to his bedpust, and they giv him a dozen, and they stuffed his
mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out. But he knowed
Orlick, and Orlicks in the county jail."
 
By these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation. I was slow
to gain strength, but I did slowly and surely become less weak, and Joe
stayed with me, and I fancied I was little Pip again.
 
For the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need,
that I was like a child in his hands. He would sit and talk to me in the
old confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the old unassertive
protecting way, so that I would half believe that all my life since the
days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that
was gone. He did everything for me except the household work, for which
he had engaged a very decent woman, after paying off the laundress on
his first arrival. "Which I do assure you, Pip," he would often say, in
explanation of that liberty "I found her a tapping the spare bed, like
a cask of beer, and drawing off the feathers in a bucket, for sale.
Which she would have tapped yourn next, and drawd it off with you a
laying on it, and was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in
the souptureen and wegetabledishes, and the wine and spirits in your
Wellington boots."
 
We looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we had
once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship. And when the day
came, and an open carriage was got into the Lane, Joe wrapped me up,
took me in his arms, carried me down to it, and put me in, as if I were
still the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of
the wealth of his great nature.
 
And Joe got in beside me, and we drove away together into the country,
where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass,
and sweet summer scents filled all the air. The day happened to be
Sunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought
how it had grown and changed, and how the little wildflowers had been
forming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day and
by night, under the sun and under the stars, while poor I lay burning
and tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed
there came like a check upon my peace. But when I heard the Sunday
bells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I felt
that I was not nearly thankful enough,that I was too weak yet to be
even that,and I laid my head on Joes shoulder, as I had laid it long
ago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too much
for my young senses.
 
More composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used
to talk, lying on the grass at the old Battery. There was no change
whatever in Joe. Exactly what he had been in my eyes then, he was in my
eyes still just as simply faithful, and as simply right.
 
When we got back again, and he lifted me out, and carried meso
easily!across the court and up the stairs, I thought of that eventful
Christmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes. We had not yet
made any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know how much of
my late history he was acquainted with. I was so doubtful of myself now,
and put so much trust in him, that I could not satisfy myself whether I
ought to refer to it when he did not.
 
"Have you heard, Joe," I asked him that evening, upon further
consideration, as he smoked his pipe at the window, "who my patron was?"
 
"I heerd," returned Joe, "as it were not Miss Havisham, old chap."
 
"Did you hear who it was, Joe?"
 
"Well! I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv you
the banknotes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip."
 
"So it was."
 
"Astonishing!" said Joe, in the placidest way.
 
"Did you hear that he was dead, Joe?" I presently asked, with increasing
diffidence.
 
"Which? Him as sent the banknotes, Pip?"
 
"Yes."
 
"I think," said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking rather
evasively at the windowseat, "as I did hear tell that how he were
something or another in a general way in that direction."
 
"Did you hear anything of his circumstances, Joe?"
 
"Not partickler, Pip."
 
"If you would like to hear, Joe" I was beginning, when Joe got up and
came to my sofa.
 
"Lookee here, old chap," said Joe, bending over me. "Ever the best of
friends aint us, Pip?"
 
I was ashamed to answer him.
 
"Wery good, then," said Joe, as if I had answered "thats all right
thats agreed upon. Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as
betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary? Theres subjects enough
as betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones. Lord! To think of your
poor sister and her Rampages! And dont you remember Tickler?"
 
"I do indeed, Joe."
 
"Lookee here, old chap," said Joe. "I done what I could to keep you
and Tickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to my
inclinations. For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you, it
were not so much," said Joe, in his favorite argumentative way, "that
she dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to her, but that
she dropped into you always heavier for it. I noticed that. It aint a
grab at a mans whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man to which your
sister was quite welcome, that ud put a man off from getting a little
child out of punishment. But when that little child is dropped into
heavier for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that man naterally up
and says to himself, Where is the good as you are a doing? I grant you
I see the arm, says the man, but I dont see the good. I call upon
you, sir, therefore, to pint out the good."
 
"The man says?" I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.
 
"The man says," Joe assented. "Is he right, that man?"
 
"Dear Joe, he is always right."
 
"Well, old chap," said Joe, "then abide by your words. If hes always
right which in general hes more likely wrong, hes right when he says
this Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, when you
was a little child, you kep it mostly because you knowd as J. Gargerys
power to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal to his
inclinations. Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two sech, and do
not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy giv herself a
deal o trouble with me afore I left for I am almost awful dull, as I
should view it in this light, and, viewing it in this light, as I should
so put it. Both of which," said Joe, quite charmed with his logical
arrangement, "being done, now this to you a true friend, say. Namely.
You mustnt go a overdoing on it, but you must have your supper and your
wine and water, and you must be put betwixt the sheets."
 
The delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact and
kindness with which Biddywho with her womans wit had found me out so
soonhad prepared him for it, made a deep impression on my mind. But
whether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had
all dissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could not
understand.
 
Another thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to
develop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension
of, was this As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little less
easy with me. In my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dear
fellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names,
the dear "old Pip, old chap," that now were music in my ears. I too had
fallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let me. But,
imperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joes hold upon them began
to slacken and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to
understand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was
all mine.
 
Ah! Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that
in prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off? Had I given
Joes innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got
stronger, his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had better
loosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?
 
It was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the
Temple Gardens leaning on Joes arm, that I saw this change in him very
plainly. We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight, looking at the
river, and I chanced to say as we got up,
 
"See, Joe! I can walk quite strongly. Now, you shall see me walk back by
myself."
 
"Which do not overdo it, Pip," said Joe "but I shall be happy fur to
see you able, sir."
 
The last word grated on me but how could I remonstrate! I walked no
further than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be
weaker than I was, and asked Joe for his arm. Joe gave it me, but was
thoughtful.
 
I, for my part, was thoughtful too for, how best to check this growing
change in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts. That I
was ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed, and what I had come
down to, I do not seek to conceal but I hope my reluctance was not
quite an unworthy one. He would want to help me out of his little
savings, I knew, and I knew that he ought not to help me, and that I
must not suffer him to do it.
 
It was a thoughtful evening with both of us. But, before we went to
bed, I had resolved that I would wait over tomorrow,tomorrow being
Sunday,and would begin my new course with the new week. On Monday
morning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside this
last vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I had in my thoughts
that Secondly, not yet arrived at, and why I had not decided to go
out to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever. As I
cleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as though he had sympathetically
arrived at a resolution too.
 
We had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and
then walked in the fields.
 
"I feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe," I said.
 
"Dear old Pip, old chap, youre amost come round, sir."
 
"It has been a memorable time for me, Joe."
 
"Likeways for myself, sir," Joe returned.
 
"We have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget. There were
days once, I know, that I did for a while forget but I never shall
forget these."
 
"Pip," said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, "there has
been larks. And, dear sir, what have been betwixt ushave been."
 
At night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he had done
all through my recovery. He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well
as in the morning?
 
"Yes, dear Joe, quite."
 
"And are always a getting stronger, old chap?"
 
"Yes, dear Joe, steadily."
 
Joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand, and
said, in what I thought a husky voice, "Good night!"
 
When I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full of
my resolution to tell Joe all, without delay. I would tell him before
breakfast. I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him
for, it was the first day I had been up early. I went to his room, and
he was not there. Not only was he not there, but his box was gone.
 
I hurried then to the breakfasttable, and on it found a letter. These
were its brief contents
 
"Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear
Pip and will do better without JO.
 
"P.S. Ever the best of friends."
 
Enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I
had been arrested. Down to that moment, I had vainly supposed that my
creditor had withdrawn, or suspended proceedings until I should be quite
recovered. I had never dreamed of Joes having paid the money but Joe
had paid it, and the receipt was in his name.
 
What remained for me now, but to follow him to the dear old forge, and
there to have out my disclosure to him, and my penitent remonstrance
with him, and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved
Secondly, which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts,
and had formed into a settled purpose?
 
The purpose was, that I would go to Biddy, that I would show her how
humbled and repentant I came back, that I would tell her how I had lost
all I once hoped for, that I would remind her of our old confidences in
my first unhappy time. Then I would say to her, "Biddy, I think you once
liked me very well, when my errant heart, even while it strayed away
from you, was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since.
If you can like me only half as well once more, if you can take me with
all my faults and disappointments on my head, if you can receive me like
a forgiven child and indeed I am as sorry, Biddy, and have as much need
of a hushing voice and a soothing hand, I hope I am a little worthier
of you that I was,not much, but a little. And, Biddy, it shall rest
with you to say whether I shall work at the forge with Joe, or whether I
shall try for any different occupation down in this country, or whether
we shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which
I set aside, when it was offered, until I knew your answer. And now,
dear Biddy, if you can tell me that you will go through the world with
me, you will surely make it a better world for me, and me a better man
for it, and I will try hard to make it a better world for you."
 
Such was my purpose. After three days more of recovery, I went down to
the old place to put it in execution. And how I sped in it is all I have
left to tell.
 
 
 
 
Chapter LVIII
 
The tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down
to my native place and its neighborhood before I got there. I found the
Blue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found that it made a
great change in the Boars demeanour. Whereas the Boar had cultivated
my good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property,
the Boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going out of
property.
 
It was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had so
often made so easily. The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom,
which was engaged probably by some one who had expectations, and
could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and
postchaises up the yard. But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as
in the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me, and the
quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom.
 
Early in the morning, while my breakfast was getting ready, I strolled
round by Satis House. There were printed bills on the gate and on bits
of carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction of
the Household Furniture and Effects, next week. The House itself was to
be sold as old building materials, and pulled down. LOT 1 was marked in
whitewashed knockknee letters on the brew house LOT 2 on that part of
the main building which had been so long shut up. Other lots were marked
off on other parts of the structure, and the ivy had been torn down to
make room for the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low in the dust
and was withered already. Stepping in for a moment at the open gate, and
looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no
business there, I saw the auctioneers clerk walking on the casks and
telling them off for the information of a cataloguecompiler, pen in
hand, who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so often
pushed along to the tune of Old Clem.
 
When I got back to my breakfast in the Boars coffeeroom, I found Mr.
Pumblechook conversing with the landlord. Mr. Pumblechook not improved
in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure was waiting for me, and
addressed me in the following terms
 
"Young man, I am sorry to see you brought low. But what else could be
expected! what else could be expected!"
 
As he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as I was
broken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it.
 
"William," said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, "put a muffin on table.
And has it come to this! Has it come to this!"
 
I frowningly sat down to my breakfast. Mr. Pumblechook stood over me and
poured out my teabefore I could touch the teapotwith the air of a
benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.
 
"William," said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, "put the salt on. In
happier times," addressing me, "I think you took sugar? And did you take
milk? You did. Sugar and milk. William, bring a watercress."
 
"Thank you," said I, shortly, "but I dont eat watercresses."
 
"You dont eat em," returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding
his head several times, as if he might have expected that, and as if
abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall. "True.
The simple fruits of the earth. No. You neednt bring any, William."
 
I went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand over
me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did.
 
"Little more than skin and bone!" mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud. "And yet
when he went from here I may say with my blessing, and I spread afore
him my humble store, like the Bee, he was as plump as a Peach!"
 
This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner
in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, saying, "May I?"
and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the
same fat five fingers.
 
"Hah!" he went on, handing me the bread and butter. "And air you a going
to Joseph?"
 
"In heavens name," said I, firing in spite of myself, "what does it
matter to you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone."
 
It was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechook
the opportunity he wanted.
 
"Yes, young man," said he, releasing the handle of the article in
question, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the
behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, "I will leave that teapot
alone. You are right, young man. For once you are right. I forgit myself
when I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to wish your frame,
exhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality, to be stimilated
by the olesome nourishment of your forefathers. And yet," said
Pumblechook, turning to the landlord and waiter, and pointing me out at
arms length, "this is him as I ever sported with in his days of happy
infancy! Tell me not it cannot be I tell you this is him!"
 
A low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be
particularly affected.
 
"This is him," said Pumblechook, "as I have rode in my shaycart. This
is him as I have seen brought up by hand. This is him untoe the sister
of which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana Mria from
her own mother, let him deny it if he can!"
 
The waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave
the case a black look.
 
"Young man," said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the old
fashion, "you air a going to Joseph. What does it matter to me, you
ask me, where you air a going? I say to you, Sir, you air a going to
Joseph."
 
The waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over that.
 
"Now," said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air
of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and
conclusive, "I will tell you what to say to Joseph. Here is Squires of
the Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here is William,
which his fathers name was Potkins if I do not deceive myself."
 
"You do not, sir," said William.
 
"In their presence," pursued Pumblechook, "I will tell you, young
man, what to say to Joseph. Says you, "Joseph, I have this day seen
my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortuns. I will name no
names, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up town, and I have
seen that man."
 
"I swear I dont see him here," said I.
 
"Say that likewise," retorted Pumblechook. "Say you said that, and even
Joseph will probably betray surprise."
 
"There you quite mistake him," said I. "I know better."
 
"Says you," Pumblechook went on, "Joseph, I have seen that man, and
that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice. He knows your
character, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pigheadedness and
ignorance and he knows my character, Joseph, and he knows my want of
gratitoode. Yes, Joseph, says you," here Pumblechook shook his head and
hand at me, "he knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode.
He knows it, Joseph, as none can. You do not know it, Joseph, having no
call to know it, but that man do."
 
Windy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have the face
to talk thus to mine.
 
"Says you, Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now
repeat. It was that, in my being brought low, he saw the finger of
Providence. He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph, and he saw it
plain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. Reward of ingratitoode to his
earliest benefactor, and founder of fortuns. But that man said he did
not repent of what he had done, Joseph. Not at all. It was right to do
it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he would do it
again."
 
"Its pity," said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted breakfast,
"that the man did not say what he had done and would do again."
 
"Squires of the Boar!" Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord, "and
William! I have no objections to your mentioning, either up town or down
town, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to do it, kind to
do it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again."
 
With those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air,
and left the house leaving me much more astonished than delighted by
the virtues of that same indefinite "it." I was not long after him in
leaving the house too, and when I went down the High Street I saw him
holding forth no doubt to the same effect at his shop door to a select
group, who honored me with very unfavorable glances as I passed on the
opposite side of the way.
 
But, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe, whose
great forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be,
contrasted with this brazen pretender. I went towards them slowly, for
my limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew
nearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness
further and further behind.
 
The June weather was delicious. The sky was blue, the larks were soaring
high over the green corn, I thought all that countryside more beautiful
and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet. Many pleasant
pictures of the life that I would lead there, and of the change for the
better that would come over my character when I had a guiding spirit at
my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I had proved, beguiled
my way. They awakened a tender emotion in me for my heart was softened
by my return, and such a change had come to pass, that I felt like one
who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel, and whose wanderings
had lasted many years.
 
The schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen but, the
little roundabout lane by which I entered the village, for quietness
sake, took me past it. I was disappointed to find that the day was a
holiday no children were there, and Biddys house was closed. Some
hopeful notion of seeing her, busily engaged in her daily duties, before
she saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.
 
But the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it under
the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joes hammer. Long
after I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I heard it
and found it but a fancy, all was still. The limes were there, and the
white thorns were there, and the chestnuttrees were there, and their
leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen but, the clink of
Joes hammer was not in the midsummer wind.
 
Almost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the forge, I saw
it at last, and saw that it was closed. No gleam of fire, no glittering
shower of sparks, no roar of bellows all shut up, and still.
 
But the house was not deserted, and the best parlor seemed to be in use,
for there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and the window
was open and gay with flowers. I went softly towards it, meaning to peep
over the flowers, when Joe and Biddy stood before me, arm in arm.
 
At first Biddy gave a cry, as if she thought it was my apparition, but
in another moment she was in my embrace. I wept to see her, and she wept
to see me I, because she looked so fresh and pleasant she, because I
looked so worn and white.
 
"But dear Biddy, how smart you are!"
 
"Yes, dear Pip."
 
"And Joe, how smart you are!"
 
"Yes, dear old Pip, old chap."
 
I looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then
 
"Its my weddingday!" cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, "and I am
married to Joe!"
 
They had taken me into the kitchen, and I had laid my head down on
the old deal table. Biddy held one of my hands to her lips, and Joes
restoring touch was on my shoulder. "Which he warnt strong enough, my
dear, fur to be surprised," said Joe. And Biddy said, "I ought to
have thought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy." They were both so
overjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by my coming to
them, so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their day
complete!
 
My first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never breathed
this last baffled hope to Joe. How often, while he was with me in my
illness, had it risen to my lips! How irrevocable would have been his
knowledge of it, if he had remained with me but another hour!
 
"Dear Biddy," said I, "you have the best husband in the whole world,
and if you could have seen him by my bed you would haveBut no, you
couldnt love him better than you do."
 
"No, I couldnt indeed," said Biddy.
 
"And, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and she will
make you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, noble Joe!"
 
Joe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his sleeve before
his eyes.
 
"And Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church today, and are in
charity and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all you
have done for me, and all I have so ill repaid! And when I say that I am
going away within the hour, for I am soon going abroad, and that I shall
never rest until I have worked for the money with which you have kept me
out of prison, and have sent it to you, dont think, dear Joe and Biddy,
that if I could repay it a thousand times over, I suppose I could cancel
a farthing of the debt I owe you, or that I would do so if I could!"
 
They were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to say no
more.
 
"But I must say more. Dear Joe, I hope you will have children to love,
and that some little fellow will sit in this chimneycorner of a winter
night, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for
ever. Dont tell him, Joe, that I was thankless dont tell him, Biddy,
that I was ungenerous and unjust only tell him that I honored you both,
because you were both so good and true, and that, as your child, I said
it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than I did."
 
"I aint a going," said Joe, from behind his sleeve, "to tell him
nothink o that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy aint. Nor yet no one aint."
 
"And now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind
hearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me! Pray let me hear you
say the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, and then
I shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think better of
me, in the time to come!"
 
"O dear old Pip, old chap," said Joe. "God knows as I forgive you, if I
have anythink to forgive!"
 
"Amen! And God knows I do!" echoed Biddy.
 
"Now let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a few
minutes by myself. And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, go
with me as far as the fingerpost, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say
good by!"
 

 
I sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composition
with my creditors,who gave me ample time to pay them in full,and I
went out and joined Herbert. Within a month, I had quitted England,
and within two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co., and within four
months I assumed my first undivided responsibility. For the beam across
the parlor ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under
old Bill Barleys growls and was at peace, and Herbert had gone away to
marry Clara, and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until
he brought her back.
 
Many a year went round before I was a partner in the House but I lived
happily with Herbert and his wife, and lived frugally, and paid my
debts, and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe. It
was not until I became third in the Firm, that Clarriker betrayed me to
Herbert but he then declared that the secret of Herberts partnership
had been long enough upon his conscience, and he must tell it. So he
told it, and Herbert was as much moved as amazed, and the dear fellow
and I were not the worse friends for the long concealment. I must not
leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House, or that we made
mints of money. We were not in a grand way of business, but we had a
good name, and worked for our profits, and did very well. We owed so
much to Herberts ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often
wondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude, until I
was one day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps the inaptitude
had never been in him at all, but had been in me.
 
 
 
 
Chapter LIX
 
For eleven years, I had not seen Joe nor Biddy with my bodily
Eyes,though they had both been often before my fancy in the
East,when, upon an evening in December, an hour or two after dark, I
laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door. I touched it
so softly that I was not heard, and looked in unseen. There, smoking his
pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight, as hale and as strong as
ever, though a little gray, sat Joe and there, fenced into the corner
with Joes leg, and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire,
wasI again!
 
"We giv him the name of Pip for your sake, dear old chap," said Joe,
delighted, when I took another stool by the childs side but I did not
rumple his hair, "and we hoped he might grow a little bit like you, and
we think he do."
 
I thought so too, and I took him out for a walk next morning, and we
talked immensely, understanding one another to perfection. And I took
him down to the churchyard, and set him on a certain tombstone there,
and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the
memory of Philip Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife
of the Above.
 
"Biddy," said I, when I talked with her after dinner, as her little girl
lay sleeping in her lap, "you must give Pip to me one of these days or
lend him, at all events."
 
"No, no," said Biddy, gently. "You must marry."
 
"So Herbert and Clara say, but I dont think I shall, Biddy. I have so
settled down in their home, that its not at all likely. I am already
quite an old bachelor."
 
Biddy looked down at her child, and put its little hand to her lips, and
then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into mine.
There was something in the action, and in the light pressure of Biddys
weddingring, that had a very pretty eloquence in it.
 
"Dear Pip," said Biddy, "you are sure you dont fret for her?"
 
"O no,I think not, Biddy."
 
"Tell me as an old, old friend. Have you quite forgotten her?
 
"My dear Biddy, I have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a
foremost place there, and little that ever had any place there. But that
poor dream, as I once used to call it, has all gone by, Biddy,all gone
by!"
 
Nevertheless, I knew, while I said those words, that I secretly intended
to revisit the site of the old house that evening, alone, for her sake.
Yes, even so. For Estellas sake.
 
I had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life, and as being
separated from her husband, who had used her with great cruelty, and who
had become quite renowned as a compound of pride, avarice, brutality,
and meanness. And I had heard of the death of her husband, from an
accident consequent on his illtreatment of a horse. This release had
befallen her some two years before for anything I knew, she was married
again.
 
The early dinner hour at Joes, left me abundance of time, without
hurrying my talk with Biddy, to walk over to the old spot before dark.
But, what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think
of old times, the day had quite declined when I came to the place.
 
There was no house now, no brewery, no building whatever left, but the
wall of the old garden. The cleared space had been enclosed with a rough
fence, and looking over it, I saw that some of the old ivy had struck
root anew, and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin. A gate in
the fence standing ajar, I pushed it open, and went in.
 
A cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon, and the moon was not yet
up to scatter it. But, the stars were shining beyond the mist, and the
moon was coming, and the evening was not dark. I could trace out where
every part of the old house had been, and where the brewery had been,
and where the gates, and where the casks. I had done so, and was looking
along the desolate garden walk, when I beheld a solitary figure in it.
 
The figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced. It had been moving
towards me, but it stood still. As I drew nearer, I saw it to be the
figure of a woman. As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn away, when
it stopped, and let me come up with it. Then, it faltered, as if much
surprised, and uttered my name, and I cried out,
 
"Estella!"
 
"I am greatly changed. I wonder you know me."
 
The freshness of her beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable
majesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in it,
I had seen before what I had never seen before, was the saddened,
softened light of the once proud eyes what I had never felt before was
the friendly touch of the once insensible hand.
 
We sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, "After so many years,
it is strange that we should thus meet again, Estella, here where our
first meeting was! Do you often come back?"
 
"I have never been here since."
 
"Nor I."
 
The moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the white
ceiling, which had passed away. The moon began to rise, and I thought of
the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he had heard on
earth.
 
Estella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us.
 
"I have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have been
prevented by many circumstances. Poor, poor old place!"
 
The silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, and
the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes. Not knowing
that I saw them, and setting herself to get the better of them, she said
quietly,
 
"Were you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left in this
condition?"
 
"Yes, Estella."
 
"The ground belongs to me. It is the only possession I have not
relinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I
have kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance I
made in all the wretched years."
 
"Is it to be built on?"
 
"At last, it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change. And
you," she said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,"you
live abroad still?"
 
"Still."
 
"And do well, I am sure?"
 
"I work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and thereforeyes, I do
well."
 
"I have often thought of you," said Estella.
 
"Have you?"
 
"Of late, very often. There was a long hard time when I kept far from me
the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant
of its worth. But since my duty has not been incompatible with the
admission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart."
 
"You have always held your place in my heart," I answered.
 
And we were silent again until she spoke.
 
"I little thought," said Estella, "that I should take leave of you in
taking leave of this spot. I am very glad to do so."
 
"Glad to part again, Estella? To me, parting is a painful thing. To me,
the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful."
 
"But you said to me," returned Estella, very earnestly, "God bless you,
God forgive you! And if you could say that to me then, you will not
hesitate to say that to me now,now, when suffering has been stronger
than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart
used to be. I have been bent and broken, butI hopeinto a better
shape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me we are
friends."
 
"We are friends," said I, rising and bending over her, as she rose from
the bench.
 
"And will continue friends apart," said Estella.
 
I took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place and, as
the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so the
evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil
light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting from her.
 
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
 
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
of some one or other of their daughters.
 
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?"
 
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
 
"But it is," returned she "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it."
 
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
 
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
 
"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
 
This was invitation enough.
 
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately that he
is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to
be in the house by the end of next week."
 
"What is his name?"
 
"Bingley."
 
"Is he married or single?"
 
"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune four or
five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
 
"How so? How can it affect them?"
 
"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
 
"Is that his design in settling here?"
 
"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes."
 
"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the
party."
 
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five
grownup daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
 
"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
 
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood."
 
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
 
"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to
go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no
newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to
visit him if you do not."
 
"You are overscrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
glad to see you and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
 
"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
others and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
goodhumoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference."
 
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he "they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters."
 
"Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You
take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
 
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They
are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration
these last twenty years at least."
 
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
 
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
 
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
visit them."
 
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
all."
 
Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of threeandtwenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind
was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,
she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her
daughters married its solace was visiting and news.
 
 
 
Chapter 2
 
 
Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring
his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was
paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following
manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with
 
"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."
 
"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother
resentfully, "since we are not to visit."
 
"But you forget, mamma," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him."
 
"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces
of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
of her."
 
"No more have I," said Mr. Bennet "and I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you."
 
Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.
 
"Dont keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heavens sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces."
 
"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father "she times
them ill."
 
"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully. "When is
your next ball to be, Lizzy?"
 
"Tomorrow fortnight."
 
"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs. Long does not come back
till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself."
 
"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
Mr. Bingley to _her_."
 
"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
myself how can you be so teasing?"
 
"I honour your circumspection. A fortnights acquaintance is certainly
very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will and after all,
Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their chance and, therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
take it on myself."
 
The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, "Nonsense,
nonsense!"
 
"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he. "Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,
Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read
great books and make extracts."
 
Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.
 
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr.
Bingley."
 
"I am sick of Mr. Bingley," cried his wife.
 
"I am sorry to hear _that_ but why did not you tell me that before? If
I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called
on him. It is very unlucky but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now."
 
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of Mrs.
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though, when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.
 
"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a
word about it till now."
 
"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose," said Mr. Bennet and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
 
"What an excellent father you have, girls!" said she, when the door was
shut. "I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness
or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so
pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day but
for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball."
 
"Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid for though I _am_ the
youngest, Im the tallest."
 
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr. Bennets visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.
 
 
 
Chapter 3
 
 
Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him
in various wayswith barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at
last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour,
Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively
hopes of Mr. Bingleys heart were entertained.
 
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,"
said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for."
 
In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennets visit, and sat about
ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had
heard much but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.
 
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already
had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable
to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite
disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears
a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get
a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only
six with him from Londonhis five sisters and a cousin. And when
the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five
altogetherMr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man.
 
Mr. Bingley was goodlooking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion. His brotherinlaw, Mr. Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes
after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he
was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be
proud to be above his company, and above being pleased and not all
his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend.
 
Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving
one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man
in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
having slighted one of her daughters.
 
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.
Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend
to join it.
 
"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance. I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
dance."
 
"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this
it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with."
 
"I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Mr. Bingley, "for a
kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in
my life as I have this evening and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty."
 
"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr.
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.
 
"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you."
 
"Which do you mean?" and turning round he looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said
"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_ I am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."
 
Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,
however, with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.
 
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as
her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Janes
pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With
a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wifes views on
the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found out that he had a
different story to hear.
 
"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well
she looked and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice! Only think of _that_, my dear he actually danced with her
twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand
up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all indeed, nobody
can, you know and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,
and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,
and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_"
 
"If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently,
"he would not have danced half so much! For Gods sake, say no more of
his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!"
 
"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively
handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw
anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.
Hursts gown"
 
Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.
 
"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your setdowns. I quite detest the man."
 
 
 
Chapter 4
 
 
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very
much she admired him.
 
"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible,
goodhumoured, lively and I never saw such happy manners!so much
ease, with such perfect good breeding!"
 
"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete."
 
"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I
did not expect such a compliment."
 
"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between
us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What
could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman
in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a
stupider person."
 
"Dear Lizzy!"
 
"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your
life."
 
"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone but I always speak
what I think."
 
"I know you do and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! Affectation of candour is common enoughone meets with it
everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or designto take the
good of everybodys character and make it still better, and say nothing
of the badbelongs to you alone. And so you like this mans sisters,
too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his."
 
"Certainly notat first. But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep
his house and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her."
 
Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,
and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she
was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine
ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the
power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and
conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the
first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand
pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of
associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect
entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of
a respectable family in the north of England a circumstance more deeply
impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their
own had been acquired by trade.
 
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an
estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.
 
His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own but,
though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his tablenor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation
to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for
halfanhourwas pleased with the situation and the principal
rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
immediately.
 
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of
great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcys regard, Bingley
had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.
In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means
deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,
reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though wellbred, were not
inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually
giving offense.
 
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or
prettier girls in his life everybody had been most kind and attentive
to him there had been no formality, no stiffness he had soon felt
acquainted with all the room and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not
conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a
collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for
none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received
either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,
but she smiled too much.
 
Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one
whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.
 
 
 
Chapter 5
 
 
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a
disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town
and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house
about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,
where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,
unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all
the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him
supercilious on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By
nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.
Jamess had made him courteous.
 
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest
of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twentyseven, was
Elizabeths intimate friend.
 
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over
a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.
 
"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet with civil
selfcommand to Miss Lucas. "_You_ were Mr. Bingleys first choice."
 
"Yes but he seemed to like his second better."
 
"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired herindeed I rather believe he
_did_I heard something about itbut I hardly know whatsomething
about Mr. Robinson."
 
"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson did not
I mention it to you? Mr. Robinsons asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many
pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his
answering immediately to the last question Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,
beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point."
 
"Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeedthat does seem as
ifbut, however, it may all come to nothing, you know."
 
"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said
Charlotte. "Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?poor Eliza!to be only just _tolerable_."
 
"I beg you would not put it into Lizzys head to be vexed by his
illtreatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for halfanhour without once opening his lips."
 
"Are you quite sure, maam?is not there a little mistake?" said Jane.
"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her."
 
"Ayebecause she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
could not help answering her but she said he seemed quite angry at
being spoke to."
 
"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much,
unless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable."
 
"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very
agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it
was everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had
heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise."
 
"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I
wish he had danced with Eliza."
 
"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_,
if I were you."
 
"I believe, maam, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him."
 
"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud."
 
"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."
 
"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, "is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may
be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."
 
"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas, who came with
his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day."
 
"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs.
Bennet "and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle
directly."
 
The boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.
 
 
 
Chapter 6
 
 
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit
was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennets pleasing manners grew on
the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley and though the mother was
found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards
the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment
of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration. It
was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and
to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions
of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.
 
"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose
on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in
the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
_begin_ freelya slight preference is natural enough but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_
affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."
 
"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to
discover it too."
 
"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Janes disposition as you do."
 
"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he must find it out."
 
"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together and, as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should
therefore make the most of every halfhour in which she can command his
attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for
falling in love as much as she chooses."
 
"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But
these are not Janes feelings she is not acting by design. As yet,
she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its
reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
dances with him at Meryton she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character."
 
"Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must
remember that four evenings have also been spent togetherand four
evenings may do a great deal."
 
"Yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they
both like Vingtun better than Commerce but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."
 
"Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart and
if she were married to him tomorrow, I should think she had as good a
chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or
ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life."
 
"You make me laugh, Charlotte but it is not sound. You know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."
 
Occupied in observing Mr. Bingleys attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly
had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of
this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.
 
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so
drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucass, where a large party were
assembled.
 
"What does Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster?"
 
"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer."
 
"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."
 
On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said
 
"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly
well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
Meryton?"
 
"With great energy but it is always a subject which makes a lady
energetic."
 
"You are severe on us."
 
"It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased," said Miss Lucas. "I am going
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."
 
"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!always wanting me
to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable but as it is, I would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucass persevering, however,
she added, "Very well, if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing
at Mr. Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of
course familiar with Keep your breath to cool your porridge and I
shall keep mine to swell my song."
 
Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that
she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.
 
Mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well and Mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,
with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
dancing at one end of the room.
 
Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was
his neighbour, till Sir William thus began
 
"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There
is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished society."
 
"Certainly, sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance."
 
Sir William only smiled. "Your friend performs delightfully," he
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group "and I doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy."
 
"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir."
 
"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do
you often dance at St. Jamess?"
 
"Never, sir."
 
"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"
 
"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."
 
"You have a house in town, I conclude?"
 
Mr. Darcy bowed.
 
"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myselffor I am fond
of superior society but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas."
 
He paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed
to make any and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her
 
"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you."
And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William
 
"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."
 
Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined nor did Sir William at
all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
 
"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny
me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
for one halfhour."
 
"Mr. Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.
 
"He is, indeed but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,
we cannot wonder at his complaisancefor who would object to such a
partner?"
 
Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley
 
"I can guess the subject of your reverie."
 
"I should imagine not."
 
"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this mannerin such society and indeed I am quite of your opinion.
I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noisethe
nothingness, and yet the selfimportance of all those people! What would
I give to hear your strictures on them!"
 
"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."
 
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity
 
"Miss Elizabeth Bennet."
 
"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley. "I am all astonishment.
How long has she been such a favourite?and pray, when am I to wish you
joy?"
 
"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A ladys
imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy."
 
"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is
absolutely settled. You will be having a charming motherinlaw, indeed
and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you."
 
He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long.
 
 
 
Chapter 7
 
 
Mr. Bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
in default of heirs male, on a distant relation and their mothers
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.
 
She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to
their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
London in a respectable line of trade.
 
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliners shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions
their minds were more vacant than their sisters, and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
headquarters.
 
Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most
interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge
of the officers names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a
secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.
Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of
felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers and
Mr. Bingleys large fortune, the mention of which gave animation
to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the
regimentals of an ensign.
 
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
Bennet coolly observed
 
"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but
I am now convinced."
 
Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,
and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to London.
 
"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly
of anybodys children, it should not be of my own, however."
 
"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it."
 
"Yesbut as it happens, they are all of them very clever."
 
"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish."
 
"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when
I liked a red coat myself very welland, indeed, so I do still at my
heart and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him and I thought
Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir Williams in
his regimentals."
 
"Mamma," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watsons as they did when they first
came she sees them now very often standing in Clarkes library."
 
Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with
a note for Miss Bennet it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer. Mrs. Bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,
 
"Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us make haste, my love."
 
"It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.
 
"MY DEAR FRIEND,
 
"If you are not so compassionate as to dine today with Louisa and me,
we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,
for a whole days teteatete between two women can never end without a
quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the
gentlemen are to dine with the officers.Yours ever,
 
"CAROLINE BINGLEY"
 
"With the officers!" cried Lydia. "I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_."
 
"Dining out," said Mrs. Bennet, "that is very unlucky."
 
"Can I have the carriage?" said Jane.
 
"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain and then you must stay all night."
 
"That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home."
 
"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingleys chaise to go to Meryton,
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."
 
"I had much rather go in the coach."
 
"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?"
 
"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."
 
"But if you have got them today," said Elizabeth, "my mothers purpose
will be answered."
 
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a
bad day. Her hopes were answered Jane had not been gone long before
it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission
Jane certainly could not come back.
 
"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs. Bennet more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the
next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for Elizabeth
 
"MY DEAREST LIZZY,
 
"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not
hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.
Jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been
to meand, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the
matter with me.Yours, etc."
 
"Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illnessif she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
Mr. Bingley, and under your orders."
 
"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling
colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is
all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage."
 
Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman, walking
was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.
 
"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
there."
 
"I shall be very fit to see Janewhich is all I want."
 
"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
horses?"
 
"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing
when one has a motive only three miles. I shall be back by dinner."
 
"I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."
 
"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and Lydia.
Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
together.
 
"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter before he goes."
 
In Meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.
 
She was shown into the breakfastparlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such
dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
for it. She was received, however, very politely by them and in their
brothers manners there was something better than politeness there
was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.
Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as
to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was
thinking only of his breakfast.
 
Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not
well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them
together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended
her.
 
When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and Elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught
a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were
the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out, they had, in
fact, nothing to do elsewhere.
 
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to
Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply
of clothes.
 
 
 
Chapter 8
 
 
At five oclock the two ladies retired to dress, and at halfpast six
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingleys, she could not make a very
favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their
indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.
 
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was
engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so and as for Mr.
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards who, when he found her to prefer a plain
dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.
 
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence
she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the
same, and added
 
"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really
looked almost wild."
 
"She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!"
 
"Yes, and her petticoat I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, I am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to
hide it not doing its office."
 
"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley "but this was
all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite
escaped my notice."
 
"_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley "and I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such
an exhibition."
 
"Certainly not."
 
"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by
it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most countrytown indifference to decorum."
 
"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said
Bingley.
 
"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, "that
this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes."
 
"Not at all," he replied "they were brightened by the exercise." A
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again
 
"I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very
sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with
such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is
no chance of it."
 
"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton."
 
"Yes and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."
 
"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.
 
"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it
would not make them one jot less agreeable."
 
"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world," replied Darcy.
 
To this speech Bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friends vulgar relations.
 
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on
leaving the diningparlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and
when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
downstairs herself. On entering the drawingroom she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.
 
"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he "that is rather singular."
 
"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards. She is a great
reader, and has no pleasure in anything else."
 
"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth "I am
_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."
 
"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley "and
I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well."
 
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the
table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her
othersall that his library afforded.
 
"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever looked into."
 
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.
 
"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left
so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!"
 
"It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many
generations."
 
"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books."
 
"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these."
 
"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be
half as delightful as Pemberley."
 
"I wish it may."
 
"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a
finer county in England than Derbyshire."
 
"With all my heart I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it."
 
"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."
 
"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."
 
Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very
little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew
near the cardtable, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his
eldest sister, to observe the game.
 
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley "will
she be as tall as I am?"
 
"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennets height, or
rather taller."
 
"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me
so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished
for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite."
 
"It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished as they all are."
 
"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?"
 
"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and
net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure
I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
informed that she was very accomplished."
 
"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has
too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I
cannot boast of knowing more than halfadozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished."
 
"Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley.
 
"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman."
 
"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it."
 
"Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word and besides
all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but halfdeserved."
 
"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must
yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading."
 
"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."
 
"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
this?"
 
"I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe united."
 
Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.
 
"Elizabeth Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,
"is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the
other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men, I dare say, it
succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."
 
"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
"there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable."
 
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.
 
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for
immediately while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians. This she would not hear of but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled
that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters
declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief
to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.
 
 
 
Chapter 9
 
 
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.
 
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She
would not listen, therefore, to her daughters proposal of being carried
home neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingleys appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.
 
"Indeed I have, sir," was her answer. "She is a great deal too ill to be
moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass
a little longer on your kindness."
 
"Removed!" cried Bingley. "It must not be thought of. My sister, I am
sure, will not hear of her removal."
 
"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
"that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she
remains with us."
 
Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.
 
"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers
a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are
nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a
charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the
country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it
in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease."
 
"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he "and therefore if I
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."
 
"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth.
 
"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her.
 
"Oh! yesI understand you perfectly."
 
"I wish I might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen
through I am afraid is pitiful."
 
"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate
character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."
 
"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."
 
"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a
studier of character. It must be an amusing study."
 
"Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at
least that advantage."
 
"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but a few subjects for
such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
unvarying society."
 
"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever."
 
"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning
a country neighbourhood. "I assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town."
 
Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.
 
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for
my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?"
 
"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it
and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."
 
"Ayethat is because you have the right disposition. But that
gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing
at all."
 
"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her
mother. "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,
which you must acknowledge to be true."
 
"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were but as to not meeting
with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with fourandtwenty families."
 
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards
Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.
 
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So
genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_
is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very
important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter."
 
"Did Charlotte dine with you?"
 
"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mincepies. For
my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work
_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,
I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think
Charlotte so _very_ plainbut then she is our particular friend."
 
"She seems a very pleasant young woman."
 
"Oh! dear, yes but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me Janes beauty. I do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, Janeone does not often see anybody
better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own
partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother
Gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw was
sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he
did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses
on her, and very pretty they were."
 
"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently. "There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"
 
"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy.
 
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is
strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."
 
Darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence Mrs.
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to
Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.
 
Lydia was a stout, wellgrown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and goodhumoured countenance a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural selfconsequence, which the
attention of the officers, to whom her uncles good dinners, and her own
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very
equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him of his promise adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear
 
"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement and when
your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of
the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill."
 
Lydia declared herself satisfied. "Oh! yesit would be much better to
wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball," she
added, "I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."
 
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingleys witticisms on _fine eyes_.
 
 
 
Chapter 10
 
 
The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend and in the evening Elizabeth joined
their party in the drawingroom. The lootable, however, did not appear.
Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and
Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.
 
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in union with her opinion of each.
 
"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"
 
He made no answer.
 
"You write uncommonly fast."
 
"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly."
 
"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!"
 
"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours."
 
"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."
 
"I have already told her so once, by your desire."
 
"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend
pens remarkably well."
 
"Thank youbut I always mend my own."
 
"How can you contrive to write so even?"
 
He was silent.
 
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantleys."
 
"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At
present I have not room to do them justice."
 
"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you
always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?"
 
"They are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me
to determine."
 
"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
ease, cannot write ill."
 
"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her
brother, "because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for
words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?"
 
"My style of writing is very different from yours."
 
"Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."
 
"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express themby which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."
 
"Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."
 
"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of
humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast."
 
"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"
 
"The indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with
quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?"
 
"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,
I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to show off before the ladies."
 
"I dare say you believed it but I am by no means convinced that
you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as
dependent on chance as that of any man I know and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, Bingley, you had better
stay till next week, you would probably do it, you would probably not
goand at another word, might stay a month."
 
"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much
more than he did himself."
 
"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a
circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could."
 
"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"
 
"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter Darcy must speak for
himself."
 
"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to
stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,
that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and
the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering
one argument in favour of its propriety."
 
"To yield readilyeasilyto the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you."
 
"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either."
 
"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"
 
"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to
arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?"
 
"By all means," cried Bingley "let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not
know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,
when he has nothing to do."
 
Mr. Darcy smiled but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.
 
"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend. "You dislike an argument,
and want to silence this."
 
"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me."
 
"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side and Mr.
Darcy had much better finish his letter."
 
Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
 
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity
to the pianoforte and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.
 
Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,
Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some musicbooks
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcys eyes were fixed
on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her
because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,
however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something
more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in
any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked
him too little to care for his approbation.
 
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by
a lively Scotch air and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her
 
"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?"
 
She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.
 
"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before, but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say Yes,
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but I always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
you, that I do not want to dance a reel at alland now despise me if
you dare."
 
"Indeed I do not dare."
 
Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and Darcy
had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.
 
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.
 
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.
 
"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery
the next day, "you will give your motherinlaw a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses."
 
"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?"
 
"Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed
in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your greatuncle the
judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different
lines. As for your Elizabeths picture, you must not have it taken, for
what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"
 
"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied."
 
At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and
Elizabeth herself.
 
"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.
 
"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "running away without
telling us that you were coming out."
 
Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,
and immediately said
 
"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
avenue."
 
But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered
 
"No, no stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear
to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth. Goodbye."
 
She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.
 
 
 
Chapter 11
 
 
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her
sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawingroom, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.
Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit.
 
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object
Miss Bingleys eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed
himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation Mr. Hurst also
made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad" but diffuseness
and warmth remained for Bingleys salutation. He was full of joy and
attention. The first halfhour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire
to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from
the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone
else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.
 
When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the
cardtablebut in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.
Darcy did not wish for cards and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and
the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book Miss Bingley did the same
and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets
and rings, joined now and then in her brothers conversation with Miss
Bennet.
 
Miss Bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.
Darcys progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own and she
was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She
could not win him, however, to any conversation he merely answered her
question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant
it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a
book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
an excellent library."
 
No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said
 
"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party I am much mistaken if there are
not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure."
 
"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he
chooses, before it beginsbut as for the ball, it is quite a settled
thing and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send
round my cards."
 
"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were
carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of
the day."
 
"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball."
 
Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked
about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well but
Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In
the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,
turning to Elizabeth, said
 
"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
long in one attitude."
 
Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility Mr. Darcy looked
up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that
he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would
interfere. "What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his
meaning?"and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?
 
"Not at all," was her answer "but depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing
about it."
 
Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in
anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his
two motives.
 
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak. "You either choose this method of passing
the evening because you are in each others confidence, and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first, I would be
completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire."
 
"Oh! shocking!" cried Miss Bingley. "I never heard anything so
abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?"
 
"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth. "We
can all plague and punish one another. Tease himlaugh at him. Intimate
as you are, you must know how it is to be done."
 
"But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has
not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence of
mind! No, no I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will
not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a
subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself."
 
"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth. "That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a
laugh."
 
"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me more credit than can be.
The wisest and the best of mennay, the wisest and best of their
actionsmay be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in
life is a joke."
 
"Certainly," replied Elizabeth"there are such people, but I hope I
am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.
Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,
and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely
what you are without."
 
"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study
of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule."
 
"Such as vanity and pride."
 
"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pridewhere there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."
 
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.
 
"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss Bingley
"and pray what is the result?"
 
"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it
himself without disguise."
 
"No," said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch
for. It is, I believe, too little yieldingcertainly too little for the
convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others
so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings
are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper
would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost
forever."
 
"_That_ is a failing indeed!" cried Elizabeth. "Implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I
really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me."
 
"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evila natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."
 
"And _your_ defect is to hate everybody."
 
"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is willfully to misunderstand
them."
 
"Do let us have a little music," cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share. "Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr. Hurst?"
 
Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
opened and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for
it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.
 
 
 
Chapter 12
 
 
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Janes week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeths wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before Tuesday and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them
very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingleys carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.
 
The communication excited many professions of concern and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work
on Jane and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.
 
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
safe for herthat she was not enough recovered but Jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.
 
To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligenceElizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he likedand Miss
Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope
of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were
at one time left by themselves for halfanhour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.
 
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place. Miss Bingleys civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her
to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.
 
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle. The
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of
its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and
Elizabeth.
 
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thoroughbass and human
nature and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of
threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information
for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said
in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday several of the officers
had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it
had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.
 
 
 
Chapter 13
 
 
"I hope, my dear," said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner today,
because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."
 
"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call inand I hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home."
 
"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger."
 
Mrs. Bennets eyes sparkled. "A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.
Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.
Bingley. Butgood Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be
got today. Lydia, my love, ring the bellI must speak to Hill this
moment."
 
"It is _not_ Mr. Bingley," said her husband "it is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life."
 
This roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.
 
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained
 
"About a month ago I received this letter and about a fortnight ago
I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."
 
"Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it."
 
Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They
had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which
Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.
 
"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet, "and
nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself."
 
"No, that I am sure I shall not and I think it is very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false
friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did
before him?"
 
"Why, indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear."
 
"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.
 
"Dear Sir,
 
"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach but
for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might
seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone
with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.There, Mrs.
Bennet.My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having
received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be
distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de
Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has
preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be
my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which
are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I
feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds I
flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and
that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate
will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the
offered olivebranch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for
it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible
amendsbut of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to
receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting
on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four oclock, and
shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday seennight
following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine
is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided
that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.I
remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and
daughters, your wellwisher and friend,
 
"WILLIAM COLLINS"
 
"At four oclock, therefore, we may expect this peacemaking gentleman,"
said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. "He seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again."
 
"There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if
he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him."
 
"Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit."
 
Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.
 
"He must be an oddity, I think," said she. "I cannot make him
out.There is something very pompous in his style.And what can he
mean by apologising for being next in the entail?We cannot suppose he
would help it if he could.Could he be a sensible man, sir?"
 
"No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse. There is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his
letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him."
 
"In point of composition," said Mary, "the letter does not seem
defective. The idea of the olivebranch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed."
 
To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for
their mother, Mr. Collinss letter had done away much of her illwill,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
astonished her husband and daughters.
 
Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in
need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a
tall, heavylooking young man of fiveandtwenty. His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this
instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This
gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but Mrs.
Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.
 
"You are very kind, I am sure and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so
oddly."
 
"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate."
 
"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed."
 
"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and
could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more but, perhaps,
when we are better acquainted"
 
He was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each
other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collinss admiration. The
hall, the diningroom, and all its furniture, were examined and praised
and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennets
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its
cooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who
assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a
good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He
begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour.
 
 
 
Chapter 14
 
 
During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady
Catherine de Bourghs attention to his wishes, and consideration for
his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen
better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he protested that "he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in
a person of ranksuch affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to
approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herselfsome shelves in the closet up stairs."
 
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs. Bennet, "and
I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?"
 
"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her ladyships residence."
 
"I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?"
 
"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property."
 
"Ah!" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than
many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?"
 
"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says
that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks
the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many
accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."
 
"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at
court."
 
"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town
and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the
British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable
to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that
her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay."
 
"You judge very properly," said Mr. Bennet, "and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?"
 
"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible."
 
Mr. Bennets expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner
in his pleasure.
 
By teatime, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad
to take his guest into the drawingroom again, and, when tea was over,
glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily
assented, and a book was produced but, on beholding it for everything
announced it to be from a circulating library, he started back, and
begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at
him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some
deliberation he chose Fordyces Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the
volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three
pages, she interrupted him with
 
"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away
Richard and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me
so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton tomorrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town."
 
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but Mr.
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said
 
"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes
me, I confess for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin."
 
Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydias
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no illwill, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.
 
 
 
Chapter 15
 
 
Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part
of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had
given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a
good deal counteracted by the selfconceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant and the respect which
he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, selfimportance and humility.
 
Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to
marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
This was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathers
estate and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.
 
His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennets lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration for in a
quarter of an hours teteatete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. "As to
her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to sayshe could
not positively answerbut she did not _know_ of any prepossession her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."
 
Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabethand it was soon
donedone while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.
 
Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before was now high in her good graces.
 
Lydias intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her and Mr. Collins was to attend them,
at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself for thither Mr. Collins had followed
him after breakfast and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such
doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared, as he told
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the
house, he was used to be free from them there his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their
walk and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.
 
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were
immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and
nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in
a shop window, could recall them.
 
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking
with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was
the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came
to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the
strangers air, all wondered who he could be and Kitty and Lydia,
determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under
pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately
had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had
reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated
permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with
him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a
commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be for the
young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.
His appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part of
beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness
of conversationa readiness at the same time perfectly correct and
unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together
very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy
and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the
ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and
began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and
Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to
Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated
it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes
on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the
stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they
looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.
Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,
after a few moments, touched his hata salutation which Mr. Darcy just
deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to
imagine it was impossible not to long to know.
 
In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.
 
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr. Phillips house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydias
pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of
Mrs. Phillipss throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the
invitation.
 
Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest,
from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was
eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as
their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing
about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Joness shopboy in the
street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to
Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility
was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Janes introduction of him. She
received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with
as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous
acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,
however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who
introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an
excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon
put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom,
however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that
Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a
lieutenants commission in the shire. She had been watching him the
last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.
Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the
occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the
officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid,
disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses
the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.
 
As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen but though Jane would have defended either
or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain
such behaviour than her sister.
 
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring
Mrs. Phillipss manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be
attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so
much attention in the whole course of his life.
 
 
 
Chapter 16
 
 
As no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr. Collinss scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton and
the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawingroom,
that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncles invitation, and was then in
the house.
 
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast
parlour at Rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what
Rosings was, and who was its proprietorwhen she had listened to the
description of only one of Lady Catherines drawingrooms, and found
that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeepers room.
 
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and
the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.
The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.
The officers of the shire were in general a very creditable,
gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party but
Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broadfaced, stuffy uncle Phillips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.
 
Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel
that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered
interesting by the skill of the speaker.
 
With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the
officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance to the young
ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind
listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly
supplied with coffee and muffin. When the cardtables were placed, he
had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.
 
"I know little of the game at present," said he, "but I shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation in life" Mrs. Phillips was very
glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.
 
Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there
seemed danger of Lydias engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore
at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear
him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be
toldthe history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not
even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton and, after receiving her answer, asked in
a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.
 
"About a month," said Elizabeth and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand."
 
"Yes," replied Mr. Wickham "his estate there is a noble one. A clear
ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more
capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for
I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my
infancy."
 
Elizabeth could not but look surprised.
 
"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?"
 
"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth very warmly. "I have
spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable."
 
"I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being
agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_
to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else. Here you are in your own family."
 
"Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in
the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in
Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find
him more favourably spoken of by anyone."
 
"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short
interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen."
 
"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
illtempered man." Wickham only shook his head.
 
"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer."
 
"I do not at all know but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."
 
"Oh! noit is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense
of very great illusage, and most painful regrets at his being what he
is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had and I can never
be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by
a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and
everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
memory of his father."
 
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.
 
Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that
he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very
intelligible gallantry.
 
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added,
"which was my chief inducement to enter the shire. I knew it to be
a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.
Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my professionI
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now."
 
"Indeed!"
 
"Yesthe late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere."
 
"Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth "but how could _that_ be? How could his
will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?"
 
"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudencein short anything or nothing. Certain
it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was
of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and
I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can
recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort
of men, and that he hates me."
 
"This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced."
 
"Some time or other he _will_ bebut it shall not be by _me_. Till I
can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_."
 
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.
 
"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive? What can
have induced him to behave so cruelly?"
 
"A thorough, determined dislike of mea dislike which I cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon
attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had
not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sort
of preference which was often given me."
 
"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as thisthough I have never liked
him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be
despising his fellowcreatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this."
 
After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_
remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of
his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition
must be dreadful."
 
"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham "I can hardly
be just to him."
 
Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To
treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his
father!" She could have added, "A young man, too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable"but she contented herself
with, "and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,
connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!"
 
"We were born in the same parish, within the same park the greatest
part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,
appears to do so much credit tobut he gave up everything to be of
use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the
Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendence,
and when, immediately before my fathers death, Mr. Darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself."
 
"How strange!" cried Elizabeth. "How abominable! I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfor
dishonesty I must call it."
 
"It _is_ wonderful," replied Wickham, "for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride and pride had often been his best friend. It has
connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are
none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
impulses even than pride."
 
"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?"
 
"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money
freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the
poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pridefor he is very proud of what
his father washave done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,
to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,
which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and
careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up
as the most attentive and best of brothers."
 
"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?"
 
He shook his head. "I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to
speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brothervery, very
proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond
of me and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is
nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her fathers death, her
home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her
education."
 
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying
 
"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you
know Mr. Bingley?"
 
"Not at all."
 
"He is a sweettempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.
Darcy is."
 
"Probably not but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not
want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is
a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His
pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberalminded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeableallowing something
for fortune and figure."
 
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin
Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success was
made by the latter. It had not been very great he had lost every
point but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,
he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least
importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged
that she would not make herself uneasy.
 
"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a
cardtable, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters."
 
Mr. Wickhams attention was caught and after observing Mr. Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.
 
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him
a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long."
 
"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy."
 
"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherines
connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday."
 
"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."
 
This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
selfdestined for another.
 
"Mr. Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."
 
"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham "I have
not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but I rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her
nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an
understanding of the first class."
 
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper
put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
Wickhams attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise
of Mrs. Phillipss supper party, but his manners recommended him to
everybody. Whatever he said, was said well and whatever he did, done
gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could
think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name
as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and
Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.
 
 
 
Chapter 17
 
 
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.
Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern she
knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.
Bingleys regard and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The
possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings and nothing remained therefore to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,
and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be
otherwise explained.
 
"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way
or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side."
 
"Very true, indeed and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody."
 
"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his fathers favourite in such
a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is
impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him? Oh! no."
 
"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingleys being imposed on, than
that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it
be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his
looks."
 
"It is difficult indeedit is distressing. One does not know what to
think."
 
"I beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think."
 
But Jane could think with certainty on only one pointthat Mr. Bingley,
if he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair
became public.
 
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had
been speaking Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal
invitation for the longexpected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed
for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their
dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly
asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To
the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding Mrs. Bennet
as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to
the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an
activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if
eager to escape from Mrs. Bennets civilities.
 
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered
by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of her brother and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcys look
and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended
less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they
each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,
he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball
was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she
had no disinclination for it.
 
"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enoughI
think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
Society has claims on us all and I profess myself one of those
who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
everybody."
 
Elizabeths spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingleys invitation, and if
he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings
amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
dance.
 
"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball
of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,
can have any evil tendency and I am so far from objecting to dancing
myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
cousins in the course of the evening and I take this opportunity of
soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,
a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her."
 
Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being
engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances and to have Mr. Collins
instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help
for it, however. Mr. Wickhams happiness and her own were perforce
delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collinss proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his
gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy
of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than
gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose
to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.
 
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this
time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there
was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton
once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought afterthe very
shoeroses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have
found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham and nothing less than
a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and
Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.
 
 
 
Chapter 18
 
 
Till Elizabeth entered the drawingroom at Netherfield, and looked in
vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty
of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose
the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcys
pleasure in the Bingleys invitation to the officers and though
this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who
told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the
day before, and was not yet returned adding, with a significant smile,
"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here."
 
This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
Wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just, every
feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.
Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She
was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away
with a degree of illhumour which she could not wholly surmount even in
speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.
 
But Elizabeth was not formed for illhumour and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition
to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress
they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from
him was ecstasy.
 
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances
were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,
without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind Charlotte tried to console her
 
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable."
 
"Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find
a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an
evil."
 
When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a
simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and
reading in her neighbours looks, their equal amazement in beholding
it. They stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again
silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time
with"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked
about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size
of the room, or the number of couples."
 
He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.
 
"Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may
observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But
_now_ we may be silent."
 
"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?"
 
"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible."
 
"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?"
 
"Both," replied Elizabeth archly "for I have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."
 
"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,"
said he. "How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."
 
"I must not decide on my own performance."
 
He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance."
 
The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said, "Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners
as may ensure his _making_ friendswhether he may be equally capable of
_retaining_ them, is less certain."
 
"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth
with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life."
 
Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At
that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving Mr.
Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on
his dancing and his partner.
 
"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very
superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the
first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza glancing at
her sister and Bingley shall take place. What congratulations will then
flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcybut let me not interrupt you, sir. You
will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that
young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."
 
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy but Sir
Williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said, "Sir Williams interruption has made
me forget what we were talking of."
 
"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.
We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we
are to talk of next I cannot imagine."
 
"What think you of books?" said he, smiling.
 
"Booksoh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings."
 
"I am sorry you think so but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions."
 
"NoI cannot talk of books in a ballroom my head is always full of
something else."
 
"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenesdoes it?" said he,
with a look of doubt.
 
"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
created_."
 
"I am," said he, with a firm voice.
 
"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"
 
"I hope not."
 
"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first."
 
"May I ask to what these questions tend?"
 
"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity. "I am trying to make it out."
 
"And what is your success?"
 
She shook her head. "I do not get on at all. I hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."
 
"I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that reports may vary
greatly with respect to me and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."
 
"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunity."
 
"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,
for in Darcys breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards
her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.
 
They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and
with an expression of civil disdain accosted her
 
"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!
Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand
questions and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among
his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late
Mr. Darcys steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to
give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to Mr. Darcys
using him ill, it is perfectly false for, on the contrary, he has
always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated
Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but
I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he
cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother
thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to
the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself
out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent
thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,
Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourites guilt but really,
considering his descent, one could not expect much better."
 
"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said
Elizabeth angrily "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of Mr. Darcys steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he informed me himself."
 
"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
"Excuse my interferenceit was kindly meant."
 
"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself. "You are much mistaken
if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.
Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who has undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.
Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for
Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way
before the hope of Janes being in the fairest way for happiness.
 
"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sisters, "what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case
you may be sure of my pardon."
 
"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of
his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended Mr. Darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
received and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sisters,
Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has
been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcys regard."
 
"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?"
 
"No he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."
 
"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am
satisfied. But what does he say of the living?"
 
"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only."
 
"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingleys sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly
"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.
Bingleys defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of
both gentlemen as I did before."
 
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.
Bingleys regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,
and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as
to make a most important discovery.
 
"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady
Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have
thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to
do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."
 
"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!"
 
"Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
I believe him to be Lady Catherines _nephew_. It will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday sennight."
 
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him
that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction
as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt that
it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she
ceased speaking, replied thus
 
"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in
your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your
understanding but permit me to say, that there must be a wide
difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,
and those which regulate the clergy for, give me leave to observe that
I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with
the highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of
behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to
follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to
perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to
profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant
guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by
education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young
lady like yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.
Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose
astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced
his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of
it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the
words "apology," "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh." It vexed
her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him
with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time
to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,
was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcys contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.
 
"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherines discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very
handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."
 
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in
that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like Bingleys two sisters. Her mothers thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person Lady Lucas freely,
openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon
be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet
seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the
match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but
three miles from them, were the first points of selfgratulation and
then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as Janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than Mrs.
Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.
 
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.
 
"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear."
 
"For heavens sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you
to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing!"
 
Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would
talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and
blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently
glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.
 
At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say and Lady Lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and
chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of
tranquillity for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and
she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,
but in vain Mary would not understand them such an opportunity of
exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeths
eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her
progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very
ill rewarded at their close for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks
of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to
favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.
Marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was
weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at
Jane, to see how she bore it but Jane was very composedly talking to
Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs
of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,
imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, "That will do
extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other
young ladies have time to exhibit."
 
Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted and
Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her fathers speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.
 
"If I," said Mr. Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
air for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,
to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time
to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The
rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,
especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit
him of that duty nor could I think well of the man who should omit an
occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the
family." And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had
been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many staredmany
smiled but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his
wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,
and observed in a halfwhisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably
clever, good kind of young man.
 
To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or
finer success and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,
and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the
gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.
 
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by
Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though
he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.
He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed
her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
goodnaturedly engaged Mr. Collinss conversation to herself.
 
She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcys further notice
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in
it.
 
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by
a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of
an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said
nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord,
how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.
 
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and
addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he
would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without
the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,
and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on
her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next
day for a short time.
 
Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four
months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.
 
 
 
Chapter 19
 
 
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his
declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at
the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On
finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,
soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words
 
"May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?"
 
Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
Bennet answered instantly, "Oh dear!yescertainly. I am sure Lizzy
will be very happyI am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I
want you up stairs." And, gathering her work together, she was hastening
away, when Elizabeth called out
 
"Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse
me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am
going away myself."
 
"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are." And upon
Elizabeths seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to
escape, she added "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.
Collins."
 
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a moments
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to
conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between
distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as
they were gone, Mr. Collins began.
 
"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected
mothers permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the
purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as
soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of
my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marryingand, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design
of selecting a wife, as I certainly did."
 
The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could
not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,
and he continued
 
"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example
of matrimony in his parish secondly, that I am convinced that it will
add very greatly to my happiness and thirdlywhich perhaps I ought
to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and
recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling
patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked
too! on this subject and it was but the very Saturday night before I
left Hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourghs footstool, that she said, Mr. Collins, you
must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose
a gentlewoman for _my_ sake and for your _own_, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her. Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice
and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond
anything I can describe and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and
respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views
were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father who, however, may live many years longer, I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes placewhich, however, as I have already said, may not
be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and
I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds
in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mothers
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."
 
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.
 
"You are too hasty, sir," she cried. "You forget that I have made no
answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to
decline them."
 
"I am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a
third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."
 
"Upon my word, sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is a rather
extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not
one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_
happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation."
 
"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr. Collins
very gravely"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of
seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your
modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification."
 
"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You
must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment
of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any selfreproach. This matter may
be considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she
thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus
addressed her
 
"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on
the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character."
 
"Really, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me
exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
to convince you of its being one."
 
"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for
believing it are briefly these It does not appear to me that my hand is
unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections
with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into further
consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo
the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,
I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."
 
"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect
forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant
female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking
the truth from her heart."
 
"You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable."
 
To such perseverance in wilful selfdeception Elizabeth would make
no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew determined, if
he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.
 
 
 
Chapter 20
 
 
Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open
the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfastroom, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect or their nearer connection. Mr. Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.
 
This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,
and could not help saying so.
 
"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be
brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very
headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will
_make_ her know it."
 
"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried Mr. Collins "but if
she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not
to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."
 
"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. "Lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as
goodnatured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."
 
She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library, "Oh! Mr. Bennet, you
are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar. You must come and make
Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you
do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_."
 
Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication.
 
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had
finished her speech. "Of what are you talking?"
 
"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,
and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy."
 
"And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business."
 
"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him."
 
"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion."
 
Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library.
 
"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared. "I have sent for
you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made
you an offer of marriage. Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was.
"Very welland this offer of marriage you have refused?"
 
"I have, sir."
 
"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your
accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?"
 
"Yes, or I will never see her again."
 
"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again
if you _do_."
 
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,
but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.
 
"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to
_insist_ upon her marrying him."
 
"My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request.
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be."
 
Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again
coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane
in her interest but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined
interfering and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and
sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner
varied, however, her determination never did.
 
Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin
could refuse him and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way. His regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her
deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret.
 
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."
 
Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,
who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the
breakfastroom, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family. "Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone,
"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves."
 
Charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.
 
"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs. Bennet, "looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided
she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzyif you take it
into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at alland I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep
youand so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told
you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,
and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking
to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking
to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have
no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it
is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied."
 
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that
any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the
irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of
them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with
an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to
the girls, "Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold
your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation
together."
 
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could and Charlotte,
detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected
conversation "Oh! Mr. Collins!"
 
"My dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.
Far be it from me," he presently continued, in a voice that marked his
displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation
to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a
young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment
and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt
of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand
for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as
when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our
estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect
to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to
your daughters favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my
behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my
dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own. But we are all
liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."
 
 
 
Chapter 21
 
 
The discussion of Mr. Collinss offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her
mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly
expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,
but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke
to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.
 
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennets illhumour or ill
health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.
 
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.
He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their
aunts where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was
well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been selfimposed.
 
"I found," said he, "as the time drew near that I had better not meet
Mr. Darcy that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself."
 
She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to
her. His accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.
 
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet it came
from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,
hotpressed paper, well covered with a ladys fair, flowing hand and
Elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it, and saw
her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected
herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual
cheerfulness in the general conversation but Elizabeth felt an anxiety
on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham and no
sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane
invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room,
Jane, taking out the letter, said
 
"This is from Caroline Bingley what it contains has surprised me a good
deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on
their way to townand without any intention of coming back again. You
shall hear what she says."
 
She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a
house. The next was in these words "I do not pretend to regret anything
I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend
but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that
delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may
lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved
correspondence. I depend on you for that." To these highflown
expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw
nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingleys being there and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to
regard it, in the enjoyment of his.
 
"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by
them."
 
"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you"
 
"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to London might be concluded in three or four days but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are
already there for the winter I wish that I could hear that you, my
dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowdbut of
that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may
abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your
beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the
three of whom we shall deprive you."
 
"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this
winter."
 
"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_."
 
"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own
master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_."
 
"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister and, to confess the truth,
_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think
Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments
and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of
her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but I will not leave the
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing
her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sisters
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any womans heart. With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?"
 
"What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?" said Jane as she
finished it. "Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that
Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is
perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means most kindly! to
put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"
 
"Yes, there can for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?"
 
"Most willingly."
 
"You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him
to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you."
 
Jane shook her head.
 
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She
is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.
Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the
case is this We are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she
is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion
that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble
in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and
I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead
of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."
 
"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your
representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the
foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
anyone and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving
herself."
 
"That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."
 
"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?"
 
"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth "and if, upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
all means to refuse him."
 
"How can you talk so?" said Jane, faintly smiling. "You must know that
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate."
 
"I did not think you would and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion."
 
"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required. A thousand things may arise in six months!"
 
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Carolines
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of everyone.
 
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt
on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
Janes temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.
 
They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After
lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.
Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the
conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had
been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two
full courses.
 
 
 
Chapter 22
 
 
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the
chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. "It keeps him in good
humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express."
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was
very amiable, but Charlottes kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
had any conception of its object was nothing else than to secure her
from any return of Mr. Collinss addresses, by engaging them towards
herself. Such was Miss Lucass scheme and appearances were so
favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very
soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success might be known likewise for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.
His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas
perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and
instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had
she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.
 
In as short a time as Mr. Collinss long speeches would allow,
everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as
they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that
was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must
be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with
his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure
and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.
 
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collinss present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
Mr. Bennet was likely to live and Sir William gave it as his decided
opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at St. Jamess. The whole family, in short,
were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlottes
dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were
in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible
nor agreeable his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must
be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly
either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object it was
the only provision for welleducated young women of small fortune,
and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest
preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained and at
the age of twentyseven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all
the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business
was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship
she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,
and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be
shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved
to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,
when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had
passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty for the
curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct
questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was
at the same time exercising great selfdenial, for he was longing to
publish his prosperous love.
 
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,
said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever
his engagements might allow him to visit them.
 
"My dear madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive and
you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible."
 
They were all astonished and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said
 
"But is there not danger of Lady Catherines disapprobation here, my
good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
offending your patroness."
 
"My dear sir," replied Mr. Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyships concurrence."
 
"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her
displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence."
 
"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your
regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though
my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now
take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my
cousin Elizabeth."
 
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally
surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to
understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her
younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was
a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read
and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very
agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.
 
The possibility of Mr. Collinss fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two but
that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from
possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was
consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and
she could not help crying out
 
"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotteimpossible!"
 
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained
her composure, and calmly replied
 
"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible
that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"
 
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of
their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her
all imaginable happiness.
 
"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte. "You must be surprised,
very much surprisedso lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry
you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be
satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know I never
was. I ask only a comfortable home and considering Mr. Collinss
character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state."
 
Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly" and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much
longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collinss making two offers
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now
accepted. She had always felt that Charlottes opinion of matrimony was
not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible
that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better
feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a
most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself
and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it
was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had
chosen.
 
 
 
Chapter 23
 
 
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention
it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to
announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,
and much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matterto an audience not merely wondering, but
incredulous for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,
protested he must be entirely mistaken and Lydia, always unguarded and
often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed
 
"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know
that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"
 
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment but Sir Williams good breeding carried
him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.
 
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters
by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.
 
Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
Sir William remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins
had been taken in thirdly, she trusted that they would never be
happy together and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole one, that
Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief and the other that she
herself had been barbarously misused by them all and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could
console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her
resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.
 
Mr. Bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!
 
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty
and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a
clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at Meryton.
 
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort
on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though Mrs. Bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.
 
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject and Elizabeth felt persuaded that
no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,
as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his
return.
 
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised
letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to
their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonths abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight for Lady Catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.
 
Mr. Collinss return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and
they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingleys continued
absence.
 
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to
Netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed Mrs.
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.
 
Even Elizabeth began to fearnot that Bingley was indifferentbut that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as
she was to admit an idea so destructive of Janes happiness, and so
dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.
 
As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more
painful than Elizabeths, but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,
an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed
all Janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.
 
Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention
and luckily for the others, the business of lovemaking relieved them
from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.
 
Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of
anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of illhumour,
and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight
of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see
them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.
 
"Indeed, Mr. Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!"
 
"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for
better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor."
 
This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before.
 
"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was
not for the entail, I should not mind it."
 
"What should not you mind?"
 
"I should not mind anything at all."
 
"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility."
 
"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How
anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own
daughters, I cannot understand and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!
Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"
 
"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr. Bennet.
 
 
 
Chapter 24
 
 
Miss Bingleys letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter, and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
the country.
 
Hope was over, entirely over and when Jane could attend to the rest
of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcys praise occupied
the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an
inmate of Mr. Darcys house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.
 
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern
for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Carolines
assertion of her brothers being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no
credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness
to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,
been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in
whatever manner he thought best, but her sisters was involved in it, as
she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,
on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She
could think of nothing else and yet whether Bingleys regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends interference whether
he had been aware of Janes attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sisters situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded.
 
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
Elizabeth but at last, on Mrs. Bennets leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying
 
"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But
I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before."
 
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.
 
"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring "indeed, you have
no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A
little time, thereforeI shall certainly try to get the better."
 
With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to anyone but myself."
 
"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good. Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic I do not know what to say
to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve."
 
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sisters warm affection.
 
"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want
to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not
be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal goodwill. You need not. There are few people
whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see
of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or
sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention the
other is Charlottes marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is
unaccountable!"
 
"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will
ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference
of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collinss respectability, and
Charlottes steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a
large family that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match and be
ready to believe, for everybodys sake, that she may feel something like
regard and esteem for our cousin."
 
"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this for were I persuaded that
Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a
conceited, pompous, narrowminded, silly man you know he is, as well as
I do and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him
cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though
it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,
change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade
yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of
danger security for happiness."
 
"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
Jane "and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy
together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You
mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat
you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than
it does."
 
"And men take care that they should."
 
"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified but I have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."
 
"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingleys conduct to design,"
said Elizabeth "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other peoples feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business."
 
"And do you impute it to either of those?"
 
"Yes to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can."
 
"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?"
 
"Yes, in conjunction with his friend."
 
"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can
only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it."
 
"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his
happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride."
 
"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy," replied Jane
"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have
known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love
her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brothers. What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an
affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been
mistakenor, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what
I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in
the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."
 
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time Mr. Bingleys
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.
 
Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with
less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she
did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the
effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her
no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennets best
comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.
 
Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. "So, Lizzy," said he one day,
"your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.
It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction
among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to
be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham
be _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."
 
"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not
all expect Janes good fortune."
 
"True," said Mr. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that whatever of
that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make
the most of it."
 
Mr. Wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and everybody was
pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they
had known anything of the matter.
 
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be
any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society
of Hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakesbut by everybody else
Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.
 
 
 
Chapter 25
 
 
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,
Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would
be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his
relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair
cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another
letter of thanks.
 
On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving
her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas
at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived
by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so
wellbred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger
than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.
They had frequently been staying with her in town.
 
The first part of Mrs. Gardiners business on her arrival was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was
done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.
Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They
had all been very illused since she last saw her sister. Two of her
girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was
nothing in it.
 
"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr.
Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think
that she might have been Mr. Collinss wife by this time, had it not
been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just
as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves."
 
Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before,
in the course of Jane and Elizabeths correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the
conversation.
 
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. "It
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she. "I am
sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such
as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent."
 
"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not
do for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often
happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before."
 
"But that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as
often applied to feelings which arise from a halfhours acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingleys
love?"
 
"I never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance and I
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be
finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"
 
"Oh, yes!of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor
Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she
would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be
of serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
anything."
 
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sisters ready acquiescence.
 
"I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her."
 
"And _that_ is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such
a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he
would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley
never stirs without him."
 
"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane
correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling."
 
"She will drop the acquaintance entirely."
 
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingleys being
withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of Janes
attractions.
 
Miss Bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and the
Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she
hoped by Carolines not living in the same house with her brother,
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.
 
The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn and what with the Phillipses,
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of itof which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one and
on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeths
warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,
from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and
she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.
 
To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very
part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many
acquaintances in common and though Wickham had been little there since
the death of Darcys father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher
intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of
procuring.
 
Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute
description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of
praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both
him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcys
treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentlemans
reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and
was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam
Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, illnatured boy.
 
 
 
Chapter 26
 
 
Mrs. Gardiners caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given
on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on
 
"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because
you are warned against it and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve
yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want
of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against
_him_ he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you
must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father."
 
"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."
 
"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."
 
"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of
myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it."
 
"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."
 
"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with
Mr. Wickham no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man I ever sawand if he becomes really attached to
meI believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence
of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My fathers opinion of me does
me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My
father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people
are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into
engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellowcreatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not
to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,
I will do my best."
 
"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him."
 
"As I did the other day," said Elizabeth with a conscious smile "very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine
that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week. You know my mothers ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my
honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest and now I hope
you are satisfied."
 
Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being resented.
 
Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the Gardiners and Jane but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,
his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an illnatured tone, that
she "_wished_ they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit and when she
rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mothers ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said
 
"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."
 
"_That_ you certainly shall."
 
"And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?"
 
"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."
 
"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to
come to Hunsford."
 
Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.
 
"My father and Maria are coming to me in March," added Charlotte, "and I
hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as
welcome as either of them."
 
The wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on
the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that
it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlottes first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherines behaviour was most
friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collinss picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there to know the rest.
 
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in London and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.
 
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or
hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been
lost.
 
"My aunt," she continued, "is going tomorrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street."
 
She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.
"I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached
her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much
engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was
not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall
see them soon here."
 
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that
accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sisters being in town.
 
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be
blind to Miss Bingleys inattention. After waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no
longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will
prove what she felt.
 
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her
better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been
entirely deceived in Miss Bingleys regard for me. But, my dear sister,
though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I
still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was
as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for
wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to
happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not
return my visit till yesterday and not a note, not a line, did I
receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that
she had no pleasure in it she made a slight, formal apology, for not
calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was
in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was
perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,
though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out
as she did I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on
her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting
wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the
cause of it. I need not explain myself farther and though _we_ know
this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily
account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to
his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and
amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,
because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.
He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said
herself and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she
wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I
cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity
in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,
and think only of what will make me happyyour affection, and the
invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very
soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield
again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better
not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts
from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and
Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.Yours, etc."
 
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not
even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on
every review of it and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.
Darcys sister, as by Wickhams account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.
 
Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information and Elizabeth
had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable but Elizabeth, less clearsighted perhaps in this case than
in Charlottes, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.
 
All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on "I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that
I have never been much in love for had I really experienced that pure
and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and
wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_ they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to
think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My
watchfulness has been effectual and though I certainly should be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love
with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take
his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the
ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain."
 
 
 
Chapter 27
 
 
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing
Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There
was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her
a peep at Jane and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlottes first sketch. She was
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement
of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be.
 
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.
 
The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly on
his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of
what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of hertheir opinion of everybodywould always coincide, there
was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to
him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that,
whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable
and pleasing.
 
Her fellowtravellers the next day were not of a kind to make her
think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a
goodhumoured girl, but as emptyheaded as himself, had nothing to say
that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much
delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but
she had known Sir Williams too long. He could tell her nothing new of
the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were
worn out, like his information.
 
It was a journey of only twentyfour miles, and they began it so early
as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiners
door, Jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawingroom, and whose shyness, as they had not seen
her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and
kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.
 
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her
sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,
to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the
particulars also of Miss Bingleys visit in Gracechurch Street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.
 
Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickhams desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.
 
"But my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King? I
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."
 
"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,
and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent and now, because he is trying to get
a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary."
 
"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
what to think."
 
"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her."
 
"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers death
made her mistress of this fortune."
 
"Nowhy should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?"
 
"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her
so soon after this event."
 
"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?"
 
"_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being
deficient in something herselfsense or feeling."
 
"Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose. _He_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."
 
"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire."
 
"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
Derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going tomorrow
where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all."
 
"Take care, Lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment."
 
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.
 
"We have not determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs. Gardiner,
"but, perhaps, to the Lakes."
 
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. "Oh, my dear,
dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight! what felicity! You
give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What
are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport
we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other
travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We
_will_ know where we have gonewe _will_ recollect what we have seen.
Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our
imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,
will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let _our_
first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of
travellers."
 
 
 
Chapter 28
 
 
Every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.
 
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.
 
At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the
road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,
everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte
appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which
led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of
the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing
at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the
liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw
instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage
his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the
neatness of the entrance, taken into the house and as soon as they
were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious
formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wifes
offers of refreshment.
 
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help
in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its
aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,
as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But
though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to
gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at
her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.
When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be
ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her
eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush but
in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to
admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to
the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had
happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the
garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of
which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most
respectable pleasures and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance
with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and
owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way
through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an
interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out
with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the
fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in
the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which
the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the
prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered
the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome
modern building, well situated on rising ground.
 
From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows
but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husbands
help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient and everything
was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which
Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be
forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by
Charlottes evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.
 
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining
in, observed
 
"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will
be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice
when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she
will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed
to walk home. Her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us. I
_should_ say, one of her ladyships carriages, for she has several."
 
"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added
Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."
 
"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."
 
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,
and telling again what had already been written and when it closed,
Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon
Charlottes degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit
would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.
 
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running
up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened
the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out
 
"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the diningroom, for
there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make
haste, and come down this moment."
 
Elizabeth asked questions in vain Maria would tell her nothing more,
and down they ran into the diningroom, which fronted the lane, in
quest of this wonder It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.
 
"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth. "I expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
daughter."
 
"La! my dear," said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not
Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them
the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little
creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?"
 
"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
Why does she not come in?"
 
"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours
when Miss de Bourgh comes in."
 
"I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. "She
looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will
make him a very proper wife."
 
Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
with the ladies and Sir William, to Elizabeths high diversion, was
stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness
before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that
way.
 
At length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at Rosings the next day.
 
 
 
Chapter 29
 
 
Mr. Collinss triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity
of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady
Catherines condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.
 
"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyships asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
an invitation, moreover, including the whole party so immediately
after your arrival!"
 
"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William,
"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."
 
Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what
they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and
so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.
 
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth
 
"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the restthere is no occasion
for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you
for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved."
 
While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of
her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
to his presentation at St. Jamess.
 
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a
mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects and
Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.
 
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Marias alarm was every
moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.
Elizabeths courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady
Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought
she could witness without trepidation.
 
From the entrancehall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they
followed the servants through an antechamber, to the room where Lady
Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,
with great condescension, arose to receive them and as Mrs. Collins had
settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should
be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those
apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.
 
In spite of having been at St. Jamess Sir William was so completely
awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with stronglymarked
features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not
conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her
visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by
silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,
as marked her selfimportance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to
Elizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether, she
believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.
 
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in Marias astonishment at her
being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any
likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly her
features, though not plain, were insignificant and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.
 
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to
admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,
and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
looking at in the summer.
 
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and
all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised and, as he had
likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her
ladyships desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his soninlaw
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between Charlotte and Miss de Bourghthe former of whom was engaged in
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing
she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.
 
When the ladies returned to the drawingroom, there was little to
be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to
have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlottes domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as
to the management of them all told her how everything ought to be
regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great ladys attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse
with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been
her mothers maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of
her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then
observed,
 
"Your fathers estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your
sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it but otherwise I see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought
necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourghs family. Do you play and sing, Miss
Bennet?"
 
"A little."
 
"Oh! thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior toYou shall try it
some day. Do your sisters play and sing?"
 
"One of them does."
 
"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do
you draw?"
 
"No, not at all."
 
"What, none of you?"
 
"Not one."
 
"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."
 
"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London."
 
"Has your governess left you?"
 
"We never had any governess."
 
"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home
without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education."
 
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been
the case.
 
"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you
must have been neglected."
 
"Compared with some families, I believe we were but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be
idle, certainly might."
 
"Aye, no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is
wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces
of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and
it was but the other day that I recommended another young person,
who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfs
calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. Lady
Catherine, said she, you have given me a treasure. Are any of your
younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"
 
"Yes, maam, all."
 
"All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The
younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters
must be very young?"
 
"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be
much in company. But really, maam, I think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early. The lastborn has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
at the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would
not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind."
 
"Upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?"
 
"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth, smiling, "your
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."
 
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.
 
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not
conceal your age."
 
"I am not oneandtwenty."
 
When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the cardtables
were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat
down to quadrille and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her
party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson
expressed her fears of Miss de Bourghs being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the
other table. Lady Catherine was generally speakingstating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins
was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.
Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.
 
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,
gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by
the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.
Collinss side and as many bows on Sir Williams they departed. As soon
as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin
to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for
Charlottes sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her
commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy
Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise
into his own hands.
 
 
 
Chapter 30
 
 
Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long
enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled,
and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not
often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his
morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country but
when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,
and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast
and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in
reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own bookroom,
which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
the diningparlour for common use it was a better sized room, and had a
more pleasant aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively and
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.
 
From the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and
had a few minutes conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed upon to get out.
 
Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that Mrs. Collinss joints of meat were too large for her family.
 
Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in
commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her
by Mr. Collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to
be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.
 
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week
and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one
cardtable in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart
of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living
in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collinss reach. This,
however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough there were halfhours of pleasant conversation with
Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had
often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she
frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherines curiosity.
 
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was
expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not
many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingleys designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently
destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
Miss Lucas and herself.
 
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage for Mr. Collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his
bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great
intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his
respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle Lord , and, to the great surprise of all the party, when
Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen
them from her husbands room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding
 
"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me."
 
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the doorbell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in Hertfordshirepaid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him without saying a word.
 
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a wellbred man, and talked very pleasantly but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual
way, and after a moments pause, added
 
"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never
happened to see her there?"
 
She was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between
the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.
 
 
 
Chapter 31
 
 
Colonel Fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures
of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thitherfor while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary and it was not till Easterday,
almost a week after the gentlemens arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little
of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the
Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen
only at church.
 
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in Lady Catherines drawingroom. Her ladyship received
them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.
 
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them anything was a
welcome relief to him at Rosings and Mrs. Collinss pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,
as well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship, after a
while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out
 
"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking
of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is."
 
"We are speaking of music, madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.
 
"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I
must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,
I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed
delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"
 
Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency.
 
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady
Catherine "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel
if she does not practice a good deal."
 
"I assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.
She practises very constantly."
 
"So much the better. It cannot be done too much and when I next write
to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often
tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she
will never play really well unless she practises more and though Mrs.
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told
her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.
Jenkinsons room. She would be in nobodys way, you know, in that part
of the house."
 
Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts illbreeding, and made
no answer.
 
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument. He
drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew till the latter walked away
from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers
countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said
 
"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There
is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the
will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate
me."
 
"I shall not say you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not
really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and I have
had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find
great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are
not your own."
 
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part
of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of
credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all
that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshireand, give me leave to
say, very impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate, and such
things may come out as will shock your relations to hear."
 
"I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.
 
"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam. "I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."
 
"You shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadful.
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,
was at a balland at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced
only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce and, to my certain
knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a
partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."
 
"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party."
 
"True and nobody can ever be introduced in a ballroom. Well, Colonel
Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders."
 
"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an
introduction but I am illqualified to recommend myself to strangers."
 
"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. "Shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?"
 
"I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to
him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble."
 
"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy,
"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as I often see done."
 
"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which I see so many womens do. They have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I
have always supposed it to be my own faultbecause I will not take the
trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other womans of superior execution."
 
Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right. You have employed your
time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers."
 
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to Darcy
 
"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Annes. Anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."
 
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.
 
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeths performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the
gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was
ready to take them all home.
 
 
 
Chapter 32
 
 
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane
while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to
be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
halffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and
Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.
 
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were
to be within.
 
They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and
feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed
 
"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you
all after him so soon for, if I recollect right, he went but the day
before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?"
 
"Perfectly so, I thank you."
 
She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short
pause added
 
"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to Netherfield again?"
 
"I have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and
is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing."
 
"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for
the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same
principle."
 
"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers."
 
Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.
 
He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable
house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.
Collins first came to Hunsford."
 
"I believe she didand I am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object."
 
"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife."
 
"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one
of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understandingthough
I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the
wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her."
 
"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends."
 
"An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles."
 
"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a days
journey. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance."
 
"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match," cried Elizabeth. "I should never have said Mrs. Collins
was settled _near_ her family."
 
"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."
 
As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she
understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered
 
"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the
case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand I am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance."
 
Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_You_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have
been always at Longbourn."
 
Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of
feeling he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice
 
"Are you pleased with Kent?"
 
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
and her sister, just returned from her walk. The teteatete surprised
them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to anybody, went away.
 
"What can be the meaning of this?" said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone. "My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never
have called us in this familiar way."
 
But when Elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely,
even to Charlottes wishes, to be the case and after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there
was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiardtable, but gentlemen cannot
always be within doors and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
former favourite George Wickham and though, in comparing them, she saw
there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliams manners,
she believed he might have the best informed mind.
 
But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult
to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak,
it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrifice
to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really
animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel
Fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect
of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself
seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford but without much success. He
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.
 
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea and Mrs.
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friends dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.
 
 
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible but,
to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.
 
 
 
Chapter 33
 
 
More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,
unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the
mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to
prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that
it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,
therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like
wilful illnature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was
not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,
but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He
never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking
or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third
rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout
her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her
opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collinss happiness and that in speaking of
Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to
expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying
_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel
Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must
mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed
her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
pales opposite the Parsonage.
 
She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Janes last letter,
and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in
spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw
on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the
letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said
 
"I did not know before that you ever walked this way."
 
"I have been making the tour of the park," he replied, "as I generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are
you going much farther?"
 
"No, I should have turned in a moment."
 
And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
together.
 
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.
 
"Yesif Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He
arranges the business just as he pleases."
 
"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy."
 
"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
"But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it
than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak
feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to selfdenial and
dependence."
 
"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of selfdenial and
dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?"
 
"These are home questionsand perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater
weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where
they like."
 
"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
do."
 
"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many
in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money."
 
"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the
idea but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what
is the usual price of an earls younger son? Unless the elder brother is
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."
 
He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said
 
"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her."
 
"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."
 
"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your
charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way."
 
As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth. She directly replied
 
"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her and I dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them."
 
"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike manhe
is a great friend of Darcys."
 
"Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily "Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."
 
"Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in
those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that
Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture."
 
"What is it you mean?"
 
"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,
because if it were to get round to the ladys family, it would be an
unpleasant thing."
 
"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."
 
"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
Bingley. What he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing
him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."
 
"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?"
 
"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady."
 
"And what arts did he use to separate them?"
 
"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam, smiling. "He
only told me what I have now told you."
 
Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.
 
"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she. "Your
cousins conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?"
 
"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"
 
"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
friends inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.
But," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case."
 
"That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is a
lessening of the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly."
 
This was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture
of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent
matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There
could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have
such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted but she had
always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement
of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was
the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had
suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while
every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the
world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.
 
"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel
Fitzwilliams words and those strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in London.
 
"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of
objection all loveliness and goodness as she is!her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither
could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and
respectability which he will probably never reach." When she thought of
her mother, her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow
that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose
pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of
importance in his friends connections, than from their want of sense
and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed
by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.
Bingley for his sister.
 
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to
her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but Mr. Collins
could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherines being rather
displeased by her staying at home.
 
 
 
Chapter 34
 
 
When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself
as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcys
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her
a keener sense of her sisters sufferings. It was some consolation
to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the
nextand, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should
herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of
her spirits, by all that affection could do.
 
She could not think of Darcys leaving Kent without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.
 
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
doorbell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.
But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the
room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but
said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her
in an agitated manner, and thus began
 
"In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be
repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
you."
 
Elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement
and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,
immediately followed. He spoke well but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiorityof
its being a degradationof the family obstacles which had always
opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to
the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his
suit.
 
In spite of her deeplyrooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a mans affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she
lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite
of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt
of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but
his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could
only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her
cheeks, and she said
 
"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should
be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I
cannotI have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to
anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be
of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented
the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in
overcoming it after this explanation."
 
Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance
of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed
himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeths feelings
dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said
 
"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!
I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance."
 
"I might as well inquire," replied she, "why with so evident a desire
of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have
other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against
youhad they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you
think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has
been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most
beloved sister?"
 
As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued
 
"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,
you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each otherof exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind."
 
She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.
 
"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated.
 
With assumed tranquillity he then replied "I have no wish of denying
that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been
kinder than towards myself."
 
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.
 
"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike
is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was
decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to
say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?"
 
"You take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns," said Darcy,
in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.
 
"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him?"
 
"His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously "yes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed."
 
"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy. "You have reduced
him to his present state of povertycomparative poverty. You have
withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for
him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and
ridicule."
 
"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!
I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping in
his walk, and turning towards her, "these offenses might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater
policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of
my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination by reason, by
reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and
just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections?to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"
 
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said
 
"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern
which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more
gentlemanlike manner."
 
She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued
 
"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that
would have tempted me to accept it."
 
Again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on
 
"From the very beginningfrom the first moment, I may almost sayof
my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of
the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of
disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
dislike and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the
last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."
 
"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness."
 
And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.
 
The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how
to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for
halfanhour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,
was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of
marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for
so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of
all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying
her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his
own casewas almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired
unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable
pridehis shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to
Janehis unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could
not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.
Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon
overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for
a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the
sound of Lady Catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to
encounter Charlottes observation, and hurried her away to her room.
 
 
 
Chapter 35
 
 
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of anything
else and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after
breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcys
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpikeroad. The
park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one
of the gates into the ground.
 
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park he was moving that way and, fearful of its being Mr.
Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now
near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
her name. She had turned away but on hearing herself called, though
in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the
gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,
which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,
"I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?" And then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.
 
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letterpaper, written
quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise
full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated
from Rosings, at eight oclock in the morning, and was as follows
 
"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension
of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those
offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any
intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes
which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten and the
effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,
should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written
and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand
your attention your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
demand it of your justice.
 
"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,
that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley
from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various
claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate
prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and
wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect
its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young
persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could
bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last
night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope
to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions
and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which
is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity
must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.
 
"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young
woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance
at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious
attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I
had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir
William Lucass accidental information, that Bingleys attentions to
your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.
He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could
be undecided. From that moment I observed my friends behaviour
attentively and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss
Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also
watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,
but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced
from the evenings scrutiny, that though she received his attentions
with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been
in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter
probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict
pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not
scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sisters countenance and
air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction
that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be
easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is
certainbut I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions
are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe
her to be indifferent because I wished it I believed it on impartial
conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the
marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have
the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case the want of
connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But
there were other causes of repugnance causes which, though still
existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had
myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before
me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your
mothers family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that
total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by
herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your
father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern
for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this
representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to
have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,
is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than
it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say
farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties
was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led
me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as
you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.
 
"The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters uneasiness
had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was
soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in
detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in
London. We accordingly wentand there I readily engaged in the office
of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I
described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance
might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose
that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your
sisters indifference. He had before believed her to return his
affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great
natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his
own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was
no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into
Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the
work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There
is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not
reflect with satisfaction it is that I condescended to adopt the
measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in
town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley but her
brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without
ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me
enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this
concealment, this disguise was beneath me it is done, however, and it
was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no
other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sisters feelings, it
was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to
you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn
them.
 
"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured
Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his
connection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I
am ignorant but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more
than one witness of undoubted veracity.
 
"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many
years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good
conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to
be of service to him and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his
kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at
school, and afterwards at Cambridgemost important assistance, as his
own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
been unable to give him a gentlemans education. My father was not only
fond of this young mans society, whose manners were always engaging he
had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be
his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is
many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different
manner. The vicious propensitiesthe want of principle, which he was
careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape
the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,
and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.
Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you painto what degree
you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham
has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from
unfolding his real characterit adds even another motive.
 
"My excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to
Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly
recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner
that his profession might allowand if he took orders, desired that a
valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There
was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long
survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham
wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,
he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more
immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he
could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying
law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed
him to be sincere but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to
his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman the
business was therefore soon settledhe resigned all claim to assistance
in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection
between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him
to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly
lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free
from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.
For about three years I heard little of him but on the decease of the
incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to
me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured
me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He
had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely
resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in
questionof which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was
well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not
have forgotten my revered fathers intentions. You will hardly blame
me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every
repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of
his circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every
appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But
last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.
 
"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,
and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold
to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your
secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to
the guardianship of my mothers nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.
About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed
for her in London and last summer she went with the lady who presided
over it, to Ramsgate and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by
design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him
and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and
by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to
her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and
to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her
excuse and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed
the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two
before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the
idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and
how I acted. Regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented
any public exposure but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place
immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.
Wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune, which
is thirty thousand pounds but I cannot help supposing that the hope of
revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have
been complete indeed.
 
"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have
been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as
false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.
Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he
had imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered
at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,
detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in
your inclination.
 
"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night but
I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to
be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more
particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our
near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of
the executors of my fathers will, has been unavoidably acquainted
with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_
should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by
the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be
the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some
opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the
morning. I will only add, God bless you.
 
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY"
 
 
 
Chapter 36
 
 
If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power
and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation
to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong
prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what
had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly
left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the
next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of
the one before her eyes. His belief of her sisters insensibility she
instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real, the worst
objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing
him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied
her his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and
insolence.
 
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickhamwhen
she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himselfher
feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false!
This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.
 
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what
he had related himself and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though
she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own
words. So far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the
will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err. But when she read and reread with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickhams resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down
the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut with
little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read
on but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
render Mr. Darcys conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.
 
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at
Mr. Wickhams charge, exceedingly shocked her the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his
entrance into the shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As
to his real character, had information been in her power, she had
never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried
to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of
Mr. Darcy or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance. But
no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss
Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousins affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousins corroboration.
 
She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillipss.
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr. Darcythat Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball
the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed
that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcys
character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would
always prevent his exposing the son.
 
How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not
but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintancean acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his waysseen anything
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustanything that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valuedthat even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling that had his
actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.
 
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,
absurd.
 
"How despicably I have acted!" she cried "I, who have prided myself
on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified
my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this
discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could
not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my
folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself."
 
From herself to Janefrom Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcys explanation
_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that
credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her
sisters attachment and she could not help remembering what Charlottes
opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his
description of Jane. She felt that Janes feelings, though fervent, were
little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air
and manner not often united with great sensibility.
 
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.
 
The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been
selfattracted by the rest of her family and as she considered
that Janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she
had ever known before.
 
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thoughtreconsidering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made
her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish
of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.
 
She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her absence Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take
leavebut that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern
in missing him she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
longer an object she could think only of her letter.
 
 
 
Chapter 37
 
 
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then
hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter and on his return
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.
 
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as
her future niece nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyships indignation would have been. "What would she have said? how
would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself.
 
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. "I assure
you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine "I believe no one
feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly
attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to
me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The
dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but Darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His
attachment to Rosings certainly increases."
 
Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.
 
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added
 
"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that
you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your
company, I am sure."
 
"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied
Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town
next Saturday."
 
"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected
you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There
can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight."
 
"But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return."
 
"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week and as
Dawson does not object to the barouchebox, there will be very good room
for one of youand indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."
 
"You are all kindness, madam but I believe we must abide by our
original plan."
 
Lady Catherine seemed resigned. "Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant
with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea
of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.
You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in
the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly
guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my
niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her
having two menservants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of
Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with
propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those
things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I
am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be
discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."
 
"My uncle is to send a servant for us."
 
"Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a manservant, does he? I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?
Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be
attended to."
 
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary
walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections.
 
Mr. Darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She
studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect but she
could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,
or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in
the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.
They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
and Lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weakspirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydias guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice and Lydia, selfwilled and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While
there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him and while
Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there
forever.
 
Anxiety on Janes behalf was another prevailing concern and Mr. Darcys
explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,
heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved
to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any
could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How
grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every
respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had
been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!
 
When to these recollections was added the development of Wickhams
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.
 
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent
there and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.
 
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year
and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both.
 
 
 
Chapter 38
 
 
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.
 
"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs. Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We
know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain
manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly."
 
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She
had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with
Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling
solemnity replied
 
"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not
disagreeably. We have certainly done our best and most fortunately
having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,
from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the
humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford
visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to
Lady Catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage
and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You
see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge
that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should
not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are
sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."
 
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.
 
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so. Lady Catherines great attentions to Mrs. Collins you
have been a daily witness of and altogether I trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunatebut on this point it will be
as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each
other."
 
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.
Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she
had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that
her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her
home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their
dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.
 
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate
parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her
with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her
in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,
when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.
 
"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here."
 
Elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.
 
"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems
but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have
happened!"
 
"A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.
 
"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
How much I shall have to tell!"
 
Elizabeth added privately, "And how much I shall have to conceal!"
 
Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm and
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiners
house, where they were to remain a few days.
 
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her
aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at
Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.
 
It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for
Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcys proposals. To know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision
in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried
into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister
further.
 
 
 
Chapter 39
 
 
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
together from Gracechurch Street for the town of , in Hertfordshire
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennets carriage
was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachmans
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a diningroom up stairs.
These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed
in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and
dressing a salad and cucumber.
 
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
"Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?"
 
"And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia, "but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then, showing
her purchases"Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think
it is very pretty but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall
pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
better."
 
And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and
when I have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the shire have left Meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight."
 
"Are they indeed!" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.
 
"They are going to be encamped near Brighton and I do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme
and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to
go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!"
 
"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed,
and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!"
 
"Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down at
table. "What do you think? It is excellent newscapital newsand about
a certain person we all like!"
 
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need
not stay. Lydia laughed, and said
 
"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse
things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad
he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for
my news it is about dear Wickham too good for the waiter, is it not?
There is no danger of Wickhams marrying Mary King. Theres for you! She
is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool gone to stay. Wickham is safe."
 
"And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth "safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune."
 
"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."
 
"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane.
 
"I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared
three straws about herwho could about such a nasty little freckled
thing?"
 
Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!
 
As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kittys and
Lydias purchases, were seated in it.
 
"How nicely we are all crammed in," cried Lydia. "I am glad I bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all
since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any
flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.
She is almost threeandtwenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not
being married before threeandtwenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to
get husbands, you cant think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.
Collins but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!
how I should like to be married before any of you and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at Colonel Forsters. Kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends! and so
she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
was forced to come by herself and then, what do you think we did? We
dressed up Chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a
lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,
and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.
Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."
 
With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did
Lydia, assisted by Kittys hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickhams name.
 
Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet
say voluntarily to Elizabeth
 
"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."
 
Their party in the diningroom was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news and various were the subjects that
occupied them Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and
poultry of her eldest daughter Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one
hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat
some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger
Lucases and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other persons,
was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who
would hear her.
 
"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there
was nobody in the coach and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty
had not been sick and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved
very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold
luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated
you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never
should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then
we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that
anybody might have heard us ten miles off!"
 
To this Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the
generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for
_me_I should infinitely prefer a book."
 
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to
anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.
 
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk
to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on but Elizabeth steadily
opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could
not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.
There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.
Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The
comfort to _her_ of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond
expression. In a fortnight they were to goand once gone, she hoped
there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.
 
She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.
 
 
Elizabeths impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could
no longer be overcome and at length, resolving to suppress every
particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be
surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene
between Mr. Darcy and herself.
 
Miss Bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was
sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him.
 
"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong," said she, "and certainly
ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment!"
 
"Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him but he has
other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"
 
"Blame you! Oh, no."
 
"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?"
 
"NoI do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."
 
"But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next
day."
 
She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
collected in one individual. Nor was Darcys vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear the one without involving the other.
 
"This will not do," said Elizabeth "you never will be able to make both
of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them just
enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcys
but you shall do as you choose."
 
It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.
 
"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she. "Wickham so
very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing
of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it
so."
 
"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion
makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
be as light as a feather."
 
"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!"
 
"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it."
 
"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do."
 
"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to ones genius, such an
opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually
abusive without saying anything just but one cannot always be laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."
 
"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now."
 
"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And
with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say
that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I
had! Oh! how I wanted you!"
 
"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved."
 
"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There
is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I
ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand
Wickhams character."
 
Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, "Surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?"
 
"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me
to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular
relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
myself and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his
conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy
is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in
Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal
to it. Wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to
anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,
and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At
present I will say nothing about it."
 
"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
reestablish a character. We must not make him desperate."
 
The tumult of Elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation. She had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other
half of Mr. Darcys letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one
could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off
this last encumbrance of mystery. "And then," said she, "if that very
improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to
tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"
 
She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sisters spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a
very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself
in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,
and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first
attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance,
and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her
attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the
indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own
health and their tranquillity.
 
"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs. Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of Janes? For my part, I am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But
I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is
a very undeserving young manand I do not suppose theres the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of
his coming to Netherfield again in the summer and I have inquired of
everybody, too, who is likely to know."
 
"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more."
 
"Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I
shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill and if I was her, I
would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will
die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done."
 
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
she made no answer.
 
"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother, soon afterwards, "and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope
it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an
excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her
mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, I dare say."
 
"No, nothing at all."
 
"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _they_ will
take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed
for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often
talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as
quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens."
 
"It was a subject which they could not mention before me."
 
"No it would have been strange if they had but I make no doubt they
often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."
 
The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was
the last of the regiments stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies
in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost
universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hardheartedness in any of the family.
 
"Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?" would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. "How can you be smiling so,
Lizzy?"
 
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, fiveandtwenty years
ago.
 
"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel
Millers regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart."
 
"I am sure I shall break _mine_," said Lydia.
 
"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs. Bennet.
 
"Oh, yes!if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so
disagreeable."
 
"A little seabathing would set me up forever."
 
"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,"
added Kitty.
 
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcys
objections and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.
 
But the gloom of Lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she
received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of
the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.
 
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,
the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely
to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings, Lydia
flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyones
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.
 
"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,"
said she, "Though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."
 
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydias general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said
 
"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so
little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances."
 
"If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to
us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydias unguarded and
imprudent mannernay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you
would judge differently in the affair."
 
"Already arisen?" repeated Mr. Bennet. "What, has she frightened away
some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity
are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who
have been kept aloof by Lydias folly."
 
"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not
of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our
importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydias character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself or her family ridiculous a flirt, too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person and, from the ignorance and emptiness
of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger
Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?"
 
Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and
affectionately taking her hand said in reply
 
"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known
you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple ofor I may say, threevery silly
sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find
women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest
of her life."
 
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on
them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret
over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.
 
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility. In Lydias imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye
of fancy, the streets of that gay bathingplace covered with officers.
She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them
at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the campits tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet and, to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.
 
Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such
realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have
been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.
Lydias going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy
conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself.
 
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures
continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydias leaving
home.
 
Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over the agitations of formal partiality entirely so. She had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted
her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.
 
On the very last day of the regiments remaining at Meryton, he dined,
with other of the officers, at Longbourn and so little was Elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliams and Mr. Darcys having both spent three
weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.
 
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed but with a moments
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,
asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added
 
"How long did you say he was at Rosings?"
 
"Nearly three weeks."
 
"And you saw him frequently?"
 
"Yes, almost every day."
 
"His manners are very different from his cousins."
 
"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance."
 
"Indeed!" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. "And
pray, may I ask?" But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, "Is
it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility
to his ordinary style?for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower
and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."
 
"Oh, no!" said Elizabeth. "In essentials, I believe, he is very much
what he ever was."
 
While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added
 
"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that
his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."
 
Wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents
 
"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only
deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only
fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been
alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good
opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always
operated, I know, when they were together and a good deal is to be
imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I
am certain he has very much at heart."
 
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his
side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish
Elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.
 
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the
only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possibleadvice which
there was every reason to believe would be well attended to and in
the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more
gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.
 
 
 
Chapter 42
 
 
Had Elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,
esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views
of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of
a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of
the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.
 
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
fathers behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
from so illjudged a direction of talents talents, which, rightly used,
might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even
if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.
 
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickhams departure she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties
abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around
them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and, though Kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all
her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a
wateringplace and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what
has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been
looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicityto have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother
and Kitty made inevitable and could she have included Jane in the
scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.
 
"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for.
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sisters absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can
never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation."
 
When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and Kitty but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to
the camp and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still
less to be learntfor her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were
much too full of lines under the words to be made public.
 
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore
a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity and, by the middle of
June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
tears an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by
the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in
Meryton.
 
The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
weeks and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, or the Peak.
 
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing
the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it
was her business to be satisfiedand certainly her temper to be happy
and all was soon right again.
 
With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
owner. "But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."
 
The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunts arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.
and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their
cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
wayteaching them, playing with them, and loving them.
 
The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the
next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.
One enjoyment was certainthat of suitableness of companions
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniencescheerfulness to enhance every pleasureand affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.
 
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are
sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present
concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiners
former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance
still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the
principal wonders of the country and within five miles of Lambton,
Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not
in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In
talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed
an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.
 
"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard
so much?" said her aunt "a place, too, with which so many of your
acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you
know."
 
Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She
must own that she was tired of seeing great houses after going over so
many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.
 
Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. "If it were merely a fine house
richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself but
the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the
country."
 
Elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce. The
possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such
a risk. But against this there were objections and she finally resolved
that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the
absence of the family were unfavourably answered.
 
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its
proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last questionand her
alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.
 
 
 
Chapter 43
 
 
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.
 
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.
 
Elizabeths mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for
halfamile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of
high woody hills and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks
were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were
all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that
to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!
 
They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of
meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.
 
The housekeeper came a respectablelooking elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They
followed her into the diningparlour. It was a large, well proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which
they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,
was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good and
she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its
banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,
with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking
different positions but from every window there were beauties to be
seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to
the fortune of its proprietor but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of
his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of
splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.
 
"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress! With
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of
viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,"recollecting
herself"that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to
me I should not have been allowed to invite them."
 
This was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something very like
regret.
 
She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really
absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question
was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.
Reynolds replied that he was, adding, "But we expect him tomorrow, with
a large party of friends." How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!
 
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the
likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young
gentleman, the son of her late masters steward, who had been brought
up by him at his own expense. "He is now gone into the army," she added
"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."
 
Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
return it.
 
"And that," said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
"is my masterand very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the
otherabout eight years ago."
 
"I have heard much of your masters fine person," said Mrs. Gardiner,
looking at the picture "it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not."
 
Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.
 
"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?"
 
Elizabeth coloured, and said "A little."
 
"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, maam?"
 
"Yes, very handsome."
 
"I am sure I know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late
masters favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then. He was very fond of them."
 
This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickhams being among them.
 
Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.
 
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mrs. Gardiner.
 
"Oh! yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so
accomplished!She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is
a new instrument just come down for hera present from my master she
comes here tomorrow with him."
 
Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks Mrs. Reynolds, either
by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.
 
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"
 
"Not so much as I could wish, sir but I dare say he may spend half his
time here and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months."
 
"Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate."
 
"If your master would marry, you might see more of him."
 
"Yes, sir but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is
good enough for him."
 
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is
very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so."
 
"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,"
replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she
listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "I have
never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever
since he was four years old."
 
This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas. That he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest opinion.
Her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more, and was
grateful to her uncle for saying
 
"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in
having such a master."
 
"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could
not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are
goodnatured when children, are goodnatured when they grow up and
he was always the sweetesttempered, most generoushearted boy in the
world."
 
Elizabeth almost stared at her. "Can this be Mr. Darcy?" thought she.
 
"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs. Gardiner.
 
"Yes, maam, that he was indeed and his son will be just like himjust
as affable to the poor."
 
Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.
Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.
 
"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever
lived not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but
themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give
him a good name. Some people call him proud but I am sure I never saw
anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away
like other young men."
 
"In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth.
 
"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt as they walked, "is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."
 
"Perhaps we might be deceived."
 
"That is not very likely our authority was too good."
 
On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty
sittingroom, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to
give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when
last at Pemberley.
 
"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.
 
Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcys delight, when she should enter
the room. "And this is always the way with him," she added. "Whatever
can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There
is nothing he would not do for her."
 
The picturegallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were
all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
Darcys, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.
 
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of
the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested
herand she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a
smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he
looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest
contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.
Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers
lifetime.
 
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeths mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of
their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds
was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship!how
much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!how much of
good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his
eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth, and
softened its impropriety of expression.
 
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the halldoor.
 
As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back
to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former
was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.
 
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest
blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from
surprise but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.
 
She had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardeners expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer
she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the
alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that
he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in
her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke, his accent
had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his inquiries as
to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in
Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.
 
At length every idea seemed to fail him and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.
 
The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure but
Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,
followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her
coming there was the most unfortunate, the most illjudged thing in the
world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light
might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely
thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he
thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes
sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination
for it was plain that he was that moment arrivedthat moment alighted
from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over
the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly
alteredwhat could it mean? That he should even speak to her was
amazing!but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never
had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What
a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put
his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account
for it.
 
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time
before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and
seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then
was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mindin
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,
she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he
felt himself at ease yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was
not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in
seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.
 
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.
 
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds when, in spots where the opening of
the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the
valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading
many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish
of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.
With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.
It settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which
brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,
to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed
it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the
valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,
and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it.
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the
bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only
of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction but their
progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the
man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeths astonishment
was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here
less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before
they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared
for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the
turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw
that he had lost none of his recent civility and, to imitate his
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place
but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,
and she said no more.
 
Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing, he asked
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared
and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had
revolted in his offer to herself. "What will be his surprise," thought
she, "when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of
fashion."
 
The introduction, however, was immediately made and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the
connection was evident he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and
so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.
 
The conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard Mr. Darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time
to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was
walking arminarm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment
must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and
continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered? From what can
it proceed? It cannot be for _me_it cannot be for _my_ sake that his
manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a
change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me."
 
After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to
the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
waterplant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated
in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
Elizabeths arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husbands. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him
to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that
you would certainly not be here till tomorrow and indeed, before we
left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected
in the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. "They
will join me early tomorrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with youMr. Bingley and his sisters."
 
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when Mr. Bingleys name had been the last
mentioned between them and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_
mind was not very differently engaged.
 
"There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a
pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow
me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at Lambton?"
 
The surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt
that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her
must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was
satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.
 
They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth
was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and
pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of
the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.
 
He then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but
there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected
that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale
with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand her
patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the teteatete was
over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go
into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined, and
they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the
ladies into the carriage and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him
walking slowly towards the house.
 
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.
"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.
 
"There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure," replied her
aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I
have seen nothing of it."
 
"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more
than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such
attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling."
 
"To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham
or, rather, he has not Wickhams countenance, for his features
are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so
disagreeable?"
 
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked
him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.
 
"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied
her uncle. "Your great men often are and therefore I shall not take him
at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off
his grounds."
 
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but
said nothing.
 
"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs. Gardiner, "I really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an illnatured look.
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he
speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would
not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the
good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal
master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every
virtue."
 
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to Wickham and therefore gave them to understand, in
as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from
his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
Wickhams so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.
 
Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of
anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they
had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.
 
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcys civility, and, above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.
 
 
 
Chapter 44
 
 
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit
her the very day after her reaching Pemberley and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
But her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their
arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in
a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing
the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her
surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that
there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a
quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these
newlyborn notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
Elizabeths feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite
amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet,
she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much
in her favour and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.
 
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.
 
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her
being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was
only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.
 
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother but there
was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.
 
They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley
was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingleys quick
step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All
Elizabeths anger against him had been long done away but had she still
felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He
inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked
and spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever done.
 
To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just
arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards
each with an earnest though guarded inquiry and they soon drew from
those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew
what it was to love. Of the ladys sensations they remained a little
in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.
 
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own, and
to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley
was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.
 
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and, oh!
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in
a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,
though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his
behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look
appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred
between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point
she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred
ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a
recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying
more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed
to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone
which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since
he had had the pleasure of seeing her" and, before she could reply,
he added, "It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of
November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield."
 
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether
_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,
nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which
gave them meaning.
 
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself
but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed
from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion
of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgracewhen she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in Hunsford Parsonagethe difference, the change was
so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company
of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations
at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
selfconsequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance
could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and
Rosings.
 
Their visitors stayed with them above halfanhour and when they arose
to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.
 
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their
visitors left them, capable of considering the last halfhour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.
 
But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiners curiosity it was
not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was
much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of
it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.
 
Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could
not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings and his servants report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known
would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had
nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had, and if not,
it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small markettown
where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he
was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.
 
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the
son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a wellknown
fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.
 
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
the last and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion
and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She
certainly did not hate him. No hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in
his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.
It was gratitude gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,
but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and
acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations
accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid
her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most
eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display
of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only
were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent
on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much
pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitudefor to love, ardent
love, it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a
sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be
exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,
she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how
far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would
be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her
fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of
his addresses.
 
It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that
such a striking civility as Miss Darcys in coming to see them on the
very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a
late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,
by some exertion of politeness on their side and, consequently, that
it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased though when
she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.
 
Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.
 
 
 
Chapter 45
 
 
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingleys dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her
appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how
much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed.
 
On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.
 
In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there
with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
London. Georgianas reception of them was very civil, but attended with
all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear
of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior
the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,
however, did her justice, and pitied her.
 
By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and,
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a
genteel, agreeablelooking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse proved her to be more truly wellbred than either of the
others and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from
Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a
short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.
 
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss
Bingleys voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.
 
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many
a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole
partyfor though they could not all talk, they could all eat and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected
them round the table.
 
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.
 
He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingleys, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brothers
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility
 
"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the shire Militia removed from Meryton?
They must be a great loss to _your_ family."
 
In Darcys presence she dared not mention Wickhams name but Elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress
but exerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While
she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would
have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose
Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
Darcys opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies
and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected
with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcys
meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy
was possible, except to Elizabeth and from all Bingleys connections
her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very
wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without
meaning that it should effect his endeavour to separate him from Miss
Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.
 
Elizabeths collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have
fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.
 
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
mentioned and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss
Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeths person,
behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brothers
recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgement could not
err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana
without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When
Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to
him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.
 
"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy," she
cried "I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since
the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing
that we should not have known her again."
 
However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.
 
"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could
see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin her complexion has no
brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose
wants characterthere is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way and as for her eyes,
which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything
extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do
not like at all and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable."
 
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always
wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued
 
"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty and I particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, _She_
a beauty!I should as soon call her mother a wit. But afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time."
 
"Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_
was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."
 
He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.
 
Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them
both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,
except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked
of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruitof everything but
himself yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of
him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces
beginning the subject.
 
 
 
Chapter 46
 
 
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
Jane on their first arrival at Lambton and this disappointment had been
renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but
on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.
 
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and
her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves. The one missent must first be attended to it had been
written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect
 
"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a
most unexpected and serious nature but I am afraid of alarming yoube
assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,
from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland
with one of his officers to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our
surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am
very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing
to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step
and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is
disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.
Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How
thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against
him we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about
twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have
passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect
him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of
their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor
mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly
know what I have written."
 
Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.
 
"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter I
wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my
head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest
Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,
and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham
and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has
taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone
to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the
day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydias short
letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna
Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was
repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.
intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,
but no further for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney
coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that
is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.
I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that
side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing
them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but
without any successno such people had been seen to pass through. With
the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions
to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved
for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our
distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the
worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make
it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue
their first plan and even if _he_ could form such a design against a
young woman of Lydias connections, which is not likely, can I suppose
her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that
Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his
head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to
be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she
exert herself, it would be better but this is not to be expected. And
as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has
anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of
confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you
have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now, as the
first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not
so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I
take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not but
circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to
come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,
that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something
more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel
Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure
I know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any
measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to
be at Brighton again tomorrow evening. In such an exigence, my
uncles advice and assistance would be everything in the world he will
immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness."
 
"Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing
a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was
opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,
she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydias situation,
hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find
Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed I have not
an instant to lose."
 
"Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than
politeness then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute
but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are
not well enough you cannot go yourself."
 
Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless
an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home instantly.
 
On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
"Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you
present relief? A glass of wine shall I get you one? You are very ill."
 
"No, I thank you," she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. "There
is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well I am only distressed by
some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."
 
She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
silence. At length she spoke again. "I have just had a letter from Jane,
with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger
sister has left all her friendshas eloped has thrown herself into
the power ofof Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no
connections, nothing that can tempt him toshe is lost for ever."
 
Darcy was fixed in astonishment. "When I consider," she added in a yet
more agitated voice, "that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what
he was. Had I but explained some part of it onlysome part of what I
learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not
have happened. But it is allall too late now."
 
"I am grieved indeed," cried Darcy "grievedshocked. But is it
certainabsolutely certain?"
 
"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
almost to London, but not beyond they are certainly not gone to
Scotland."
 
"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"
 
"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncles
immediate assistance and we shall be off, I hope, in halfanhour. But
nothing can be doneI know very well that nothing can be done. How is
such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have
not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!"
 
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.
 
"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real characterOh! had I known what
I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew notI was afraid of doing too
much. Wretched, wretched mistake!"
 
Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking
up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air
gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her
power was sinking everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.
 
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydiathe
humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed
up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by
the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything
could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to
such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may
seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I
fear, prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley
today."
 
"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that
urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long."
 
He readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
one serious, parting look, went away.
 
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as
had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full
of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.
 
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeths
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if
otherwiseif regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on
a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,
and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him
go with regret and in this early example of what Lydias infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business. Never, since reading Janes second letter, had she entertained
a hope of Wickhams meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least
of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first
letter remained in her mind, she was all surpriseall astonishment that
Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry
for money and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment
as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose
Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention
of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue
nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.
 
She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
Lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that Lydia
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one
officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been
fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girloh! how acutely did she now
feel it!
 
She was wild to be at hometo hear, to see, to be upon the spot to
share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for Lydia, her uncles interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.
and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servants
account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them
instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their
summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript
of the last with trembling energy, though Lydia had never been a
favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply
afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it and after the
first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every
assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked
him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit,
everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to
be off as soon as possible. "But what is to be done about Pemberley?"
cried Mrs. Gardiner. "John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for
us was it so?"
 
"Yes and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
_That_ is all settled."
 
"What is all settled?" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare. "And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!"
 
But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed and Mr.
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go and Elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.
 
 
 
Chapter 47
 
 
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they
drove from the town "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the
matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonels family, that I
am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends
would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is
not adequate to the risk!"
 
"Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.
 
"Upon my word," said Mrs. Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncles
opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of
Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?"
 
"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest but of every other
neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I
dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been
the case?"
 
"In the first place," replied Mr. Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to Scotland."
 
"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such
a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
Barnet road."
 
"Well, thensupposing them to be in London. They may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland."
 
"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their
marriage be private? Oh, no, nothis is not likely. His most particular
friend, you see by Janes account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He
cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydiawhat attraction has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what
restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge for I know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has
no brothers to step forward and he might imagine, from my fathers
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter."
 
"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him
as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?"
 
"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, "that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.
Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last halfyear,
nay, for a twelvemonthshe has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
Since the shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing
everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greaterwhat shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings which are
naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman."
 
"But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so very ill of
Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt."
 
"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what
Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is
as false and deceitful as he is insinuating."
 
"And do you really know all this?" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.
 
"I do indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring. "I told you, the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy and you yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other
circumstances which I am not at libertywhich it is not worth while to
relate but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From
what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her."
 
"But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you
and Jane seem so well to understand?"
 
"Oh, yes!that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the shire
was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnights time. As that was the
case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could
it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was
settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening
her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be
in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a
consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far
enough from my thoughts."
 
"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
suppose, to believe them fond of each other?"
 
"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either
side and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him but so we all
were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for
the first two months but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular
attention and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and
wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,
who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites."
 
                              
 
It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey. From Elizabeths thoughts it was never absent.
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, selfreproach, she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness.
 
They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night
on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a
comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.
 
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and, when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.
 
Elizabeth jumped out and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her
mothers apartment, immediately met her.
 
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been
heard of the fugitives.
 
"Not yet," replied Jane. "But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
everything will be well."
 
"Is my father in town?"
 
"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word."
 
"And have you heard from him often?"
 
"We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write
again till he had something of importance to mention."
 
"And my motherhow is she? How are you all?"
 
"My mother is tolerably well, I trust though her spirits are greatly
shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all. She does not yet leave her dressingroom. Mary and Kitty, thank
Heaven, are quite well."
 
"But youhow are you?" cried Elizabeth. "You look pale. How much you
must have gone through!"
 
Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach
of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.
 
When they were all in the drawingroom, the questions which Elizabeth
had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of
good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet
deserted her she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.
 
Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous
conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and illusage
blaming everybody but the person to whose illjudging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must principally be owing.
 
"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point in going to Brighton,
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened but poor dear Lydia
had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been
well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the
charge of her but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!
And now heres Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,
wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become
of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his
grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we
shall do."
 
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and Mr. Gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her
that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.
Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.
 
"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he "though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we
may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make
him come home with me to Gracechurch Street and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done."
 
"Oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs. Bennet, "that is exactly what I
could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,
after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my
witsand have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over mesuch
spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that
I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to
give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does
not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I
know you will contrive it all."
 
But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well
in her hopes as her fear and after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on
the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.
 
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject.
 
In the diningroom they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The
faces of both, however, were tolerably calm and no change was visible
in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger
which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of
fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was
mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance
of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table
 
"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other the balm of sisterly consolation."
 
Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one
false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in
her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."
 
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed
to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.
 
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for
halfanhour by themselves and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of
the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to
satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss
Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued
the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and everything about it which
I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel
Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement
took place? They must have seen them together for ever."
 
"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on Lydias side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so
grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to Scotland when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey."
 
"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of
their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"
 
"Yes but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of
their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marryingand from _that_, I am
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."
 
"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"
 
"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt
a little uneasya little fearful of my sisters happiness with him
in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right. My father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydias last letter
she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their
being in love with each other, many weeks."
 
"But not before they went to Brighton?"
 
"No, I believe not."
 
"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does
he know his real character?"
 
"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly
did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt
but I hope this may be false."
 
"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!"
 
"Perhaps it would have been better," replied her sister. "But to expose
the former faults of any person without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions."
 
"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydias note to his
wife?"
 
"He brought it with him for us to see."
 
Jane then took it from her pocketbook, and gave it to Elizabeth. These
were the contents
 
"MY DEAR HARRIET,
 
"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning, as soon as I am
missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,
I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I
love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think
it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my
going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,
when I write to them and sign my name Lydia Wickham. What a good joke
it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to
Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him tonight.
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him I will
dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall
send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn but I wish you would tell
Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are
packed up. Goodbye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will
drink to our good journey.
 
"Your affectionate friend,
 
"LYDIA BENNET."
 
"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had
finished it. "What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!
But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their
journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her
side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!"
 
"I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten
minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!"
 
"Oh! Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"
 
"I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is
very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so
much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen
almost took from me my faculties."
 
"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look
well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone."
 
"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, I am sure but I did not think it right for either of them.
Kitty is slight and delicate and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn
on Tuesday, after my father went away and was so good as to stay till
Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And
Lady Lucas has been very kind she walked here on Wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
they should be of use to us."
 
"She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth "perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see
too little of ones neighbours. Assistance is impossible condolence
insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."
 
She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.
 
"He meant I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could
be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come
with a fare from London and as he thought that the circumstance of a
gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might
be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any
other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this."
 
 
 
Chapter 48
 
 
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.
They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.
 
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could,
to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husbands not being killed in a duel.
 
Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable
to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them upthough, as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of Wickhams extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.
 
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesmans family.
Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world
and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sisters ruin more certain and even Jane, who believed still less
of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come
when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely
despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of
them.
 
Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday on Tuesday his wife received a
letter from him it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street
that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival,
but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now
determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised
to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect
 
"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment,
whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were
anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a
clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have
nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in
his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps,
Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any
other person."
 
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her
authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information
of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never
heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both
of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of
his companions in the shire might be able to give more information
and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application
was a something to look forward to.
 
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters
was the grand object of every mornings impatience. Through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.
 
But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins which, as Jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as
follows
 
"MY DEAR SIR,
 
"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from
Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself
sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in
your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because
proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be
wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortuneor that
may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the
most afflicting to a parents mind. The death of your daughter would
have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to
be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte
informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has
proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though, at the same time,
for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think
that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be
guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,
you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion I am not only joined
by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to
whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that
this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of
all the others for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,
will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads
me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event
of last November for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved
in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to
console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child
from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her
own heinous offense.
 
"I am, dear sir, etc., etc."
 
Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from
Colonel Forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he
kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one
living. His former acquaintances had been numerous but since he
had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of
particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,
who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the
wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for
secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydias relations, for
it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a
very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a
thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.
He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more
formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars
from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. "A gamester!"
she cried. "This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it."
 
Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered
spiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavours, he had yielded
to his brotherinlaws entreaty that he would return to his family, and
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.
 
"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?" she cried. "Sure he
will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?"
 
As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet
came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.
 
Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His
name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and
the kind of halfexpectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their
being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had
received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.
 
The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware
that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
Lydias infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.
 
When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.
 
It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that
Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say
nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feel it."
 
"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth.
 
"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone
to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
It will pass away soon enough."
 
"Do you suppose them to be in London?"
 
"Yes where else can they be so well concealed?"
 
"And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.
 
"She is happy then," said her father drily "and her residence there
will probably be of some duration."
 
Then after a short silence he continued
 
"Lizzy, I bear you no illwill for being justified in your advice to me
last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind."
 
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mothers
tea.
 
"This is a parade," he cried, "which does one good it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same I will sit in my
library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as
I can or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away."
 
"I am not going to run away, papa," said Kitty fretfully. "If I should
ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."
 
"_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne
for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into
my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be
absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.
And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have
spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner."
 
Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.
 
"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good
girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
them."
 
 
 
Chapter 49
 
 
Two days after Mr. Bennets return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her but, instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."
 
"What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town."
 
"Dear madam," cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, "dont you know
there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here
this halfhour, and master has had a letter."
 
Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfastroom from thence to the
library their father was in neither and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said
 
"If you are looking for my master, maam, he is walking towards the
little copse."
 
Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once
more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.
 
Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out
 
"Oh, papa, what newswhat news? Have you heard from my uncle?"
 
"Yes I have had a letter from him by express."
 
"Well, and what news does it bringgood or bad?"
 
"What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from
his pocket. "But perhaps you would like to read it."
 
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.
 
"Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is
about."
 
"Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.
 
"MY DEAR BROTHER,
 
"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,
upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you
left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of
London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet it is enough
to know they are discovered. I have seen them both"
 
"Then it is as I always hoped," cried Jane "they are married!"
 
Elizabeth read on
 
"I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there
was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the
engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will
not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure
to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand
pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and
my sister and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,
during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions
which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with,
as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by
express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You
will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickhams
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.
The world has been deceived in that respect and I am happy to say there
will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to
settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude
will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout
the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to
Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the
smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quiet at
Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as
fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it
best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope
you will approve. She comes to us today. I shall write again as soon as
anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,
 
"EDW. GARDINER."
 
"Is it possible?" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. "Can it be
possible that he will marry her?"
 
"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him," said her
sister. "My dear father, I congratulate you."
 
"And have you answered the letter?" cried Elizabeth.
 
"No but it must be done soon."
 
Most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time before he
wrote.
 
"Oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back and write immediately.
Consider how important every moment is in such a case."
 
"Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble
yourself."
 
"I dislike it very much," he replied "but it must be done."
 
And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.
 
"And may I ask" said Elizabeth "but the terms, I suppose, must be
complied with."
 
"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little."
 
"And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!"
 
"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there
are two things that I want very much to know one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other, how am I ever
to pay him."
 
"Money! My uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, sir?"
 
"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone."
 
"That is very true," said Elizabeth "though it had not occurred to me
before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!
it must be my uncles doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this."
 
"No," said her father "Wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him,
in the very beginning of our relationship."
 
"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be
repaid?"
 
Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfastroom.
 
"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves. "How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be
thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!"
 
"I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would
not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children
of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand
pounds?"
 
"If he were ever able to learn what Wickhams debts have been," said
Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has
not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never
be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is
actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!"
 
"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said
Jane "I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to
marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them and I flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten."
 
"Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor
I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it."
 
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make
it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly
replied
 
"Just as you please."
 
"May we take my uncles letter to read to her?"
 
"Take whatever you like, and get away."
 
Elizabeth took the letter from his writingtable, and they went up stairs
together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet one communication
would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,
the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As
soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiners hope of Lydias being soon
married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its
exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she
had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter
would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her
felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.
 
"My dear, dear Lydia!" she cried. "This is delightful indeed! She will
be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!
My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage
everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the
clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about
them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him
how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear
Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!"
 
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.
Gardiners behaviour laid them all under.
 
"For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great
measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to
assist Mr. Wickham with money."
 
"Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right who should do it but
her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children
must have had all his money, you know and it is the first time we have
ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy!
In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well
it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in
such a flutter, that I am sure I cant write so I will dictate, and
you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money
afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately."
 
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her
father was at leisure to be consulted. One days delay, she observed,
would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite
so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.
 
"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call
on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.
An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do
anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you
heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married and you shall
all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding."
 
Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.
 
Poor Lydias situation must, at best, be bad enough but that it was
no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could
be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had
feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had
gained.
 
 
 
Chapter 50
 
 
Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever
of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be
her husband might then have rested in its proper place.
 
He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brotherinlaw, and he
was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,
and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.
 
When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come and Mrs.
Bennet, for many years after Lydias birth, had been certain that he
would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then
too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her
husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.
 
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and
the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with
regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,
though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would
be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the
hundred that was to be paid them for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her
through her mothers hands, Lydias expenses had been very little within
that sum.
 
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise for his wish at present was to have as
little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports
of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he
naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon
dispatched for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick
in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any
message to her.
 
The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage
of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant
farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the
goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before from
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery
was considered certain.
 
It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs but on this
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object
of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.
 
"Haye Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings could quit itor the
great house at Stoke, if the drawingroom were larger but Ashworth is
too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for
Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."
 
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her "Mrs.
Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the
impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."
 
A long dispute followed this declaration but Mr. Bennet was firm. It
soon led to another and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend
it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe
possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they
took place.
 
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the
proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.
 
She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended
but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters
frailty would have mortified her so muchnot, however, from any fear
of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,
there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydias marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other
objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.
 
From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved she repented, though she
hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that
she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they
should meet.
 
What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex but while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.
 
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved
and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she
must have received benefit of greater importance.
 
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.
 
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.
 
                              
 
Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennets
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with entreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal
purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia.
 
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon as
his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in
considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on
his account and my nieces. It is Mr. Wickhams intention to go into
the regulars and among his former friends, there are still some who
are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an
ensigncy in General s regiment, now quartered in the North. It
is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He
promises fairly and I hope among different people, where they may each
have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have
written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,
and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham
in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I
have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin
a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts I
hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,
and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,
unless they are first invited to Longbourn and I understand from Mrs.
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she
leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to
you and your mother.Yours, etc.,
 
"E. GARDINER."
 
Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickhams removal
from the shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet
was not so well pleased with it. Lydias being settled in the North,
just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,
for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment and, besides, it was such a
pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with everybody, and had so many favourites.
 
"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking
to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General s
regiment."
 
His daughters request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again before she set off for the North,
received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,
who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sisters feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show
her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the
North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent
his permission for them to come and it was settled, that as soon as
the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was
surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and
had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would
have been the last object of her wishes.
 
 
 
Chapter 51
 
 
Their sisters wedding day arrived and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to
meet them at , and they were to return in it by dinnertime. Their
arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,
who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she
been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
must endure.
 
They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive
them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to
the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.
 
Lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,
to Wickham, who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.
 
Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely
opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet
was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,
and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there.
 
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down,
resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed but the cheeks of the
two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.
 
There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough and Wickham, who happened to sit near
Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain and Lydia led
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.
 
"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away
it seems but a fortnight I declare and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure
I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I
thought it would be very good fun if I was."
 
Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked
expressively at Lydia but she, who never heard nor saw anything of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh! mamma, do the
people hereabouts know I am married today? I was afraid they might not
and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he
should know it, and so I let down the sideglass next to him, and took
off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that
he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything."
 
Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mothers right hand, and hear her say
to her eldest sister, "Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go
lower, because I am a married woman."
 
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment
from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good
spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and
all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs. Wickham"
by each of them and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her
ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.
 
"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, "and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I
am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half
my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get
husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."
 
"Very true and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I dont
at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?"
 
"Oh, lord! yesthere is nothing in that. I shall like it of all
things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We
shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some
balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all."
 
"I should like it beyond anything!" said her mother.
 
"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over."
 
"I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth "but I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands."
 
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham
had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.
 
No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and
she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to
all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not.
 
Wickhams affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected
to find it not equal to Lydias for him. She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.
 
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every
thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of September, than any body else in the country.
 
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth
 
"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You
were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?"
 
"No really," replied Elizabeth "I think there cannot be too little said
on the subject."
 
"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were
married, you know, at St. Clements, because Wickhams lodgings were in
that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
oclock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together and the others
were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in
such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to
put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was
my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as
if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in
ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed
to know whether he would be married in his blue coat."
 
"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual I thought it would never
be over for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If youll believe
me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was
rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so
just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon
business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once
they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I
did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away and if we
were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he
came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out. However,
I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well."
 
"Mr. Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.
 
"Oh, yes!he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious
me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised
them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"
 
"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the
subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further."
 
"Oh! certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity "we will
ask you no questions."
 
"Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you
all, and then Wickham would be angry."
 
On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.
 
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least
it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at
her sisters wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She
could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.
 
"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be
to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and comparatively
speaking a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand itunless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems
to think necessary and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance."
 
"Not that I _shall_, though," she added to herself, as she finished
the letter "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out."
 
Janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall Elizabeth was glad
of ittill it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.
 
 
 
Chapter 52
 
 
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it
than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to
be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to
be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.
 
"Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.
 
"MY DEAR NIECE,
 
"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning
to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise
what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your
application I did not expect it from _you_. Dont think me angry,
however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such
inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side. If you do not choose to
understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised
as I amand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned
would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really
innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.
 
"On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most
unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several
hours. It was all over before I arrived so my curiosity was not so
dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.
Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,
and that he had seen and talked with them both Wickham repeatedly,
Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day
after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to
himself that Wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to
make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide
in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and
confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private
actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He
called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy
an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_
motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days
in town, before he was able to discover them but he had something to
direct his search, which was more than _we_ had and the consciousness
of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.
 
"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago
governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause
of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large
house in Edwardstreet, and has since maintained herself by letting
lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with
Wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to
town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and
corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.
Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had
she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up
their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the
wishedfor direction. They were in  street. He saw Wickham, and
afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he
acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful
situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed
on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But
he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared
for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear
of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or
other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,
it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,
in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never
been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,
on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing and
scrupled not to lay all the illconsequences of Lydias flight on her
own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately and as
to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He
must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
nothing to live on.
 
"Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though
Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able
to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by
marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still
cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in
some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely
to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.
 
"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of
course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be
reasonable.
 
"Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcys next step was to
make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch
street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be
seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was
still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge
your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your
uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the
departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next
day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.
 
"On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,
and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.
 
"They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not all
settled before Monday as soon as it was, the express was sent off to
Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that
obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been
accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though I am sure and
I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it, your
uncle would most readily have settled the whole.
 
"They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either
the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle
was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his
niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
which went sorely against the grain and I really believe your letter
this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation
that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where
it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane
at most.
 
"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young
people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably
more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own
settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all
this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It
was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that
Wickhams character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he
had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth
in _this_ though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybodys_ reserve,
can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,
my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would
never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another
interest_ in the affair.
 
"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who
were still staying at Pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in
London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were
then to receive the last finish.
 
"I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which
you tell me is to give you great surprise I hope at least it will not
afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us and Wickham had constant
admission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I
knew him in Hertfordshire but I would not tell you how little I was
satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not
perceived, by Janes letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming
home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell
you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most
serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had
done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she
heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was
sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and
Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.
 
"Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,
attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave
town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my
dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying what I was never bold
enough to say before how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,
in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His
understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little
more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach
him. I thought him very slyhe hardly ever mentioned your name. But
slyness seems the fashion.
 
"Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not
punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy
till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little
pair of ponies, would be the very thing.
 
"But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half
hour.
 
"Yours, very sincerely,
 
"M. GARDINER."
 
The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters
match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!
He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all
the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason
with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her
heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly
checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity
was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for herfor
a woman who had already refused himas able to overcome a sentiment so
natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brotherinlaw
of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,
to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had
given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary
stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been
wrong he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it and
though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she
could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist
his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially
concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were
under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They
owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever
encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For
herself she was humbled but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause
of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.
She read over her aunts commendation of him again and again. It
was hardly enough but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some
pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she
and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted
between Mr. Darcy and herself.
 
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some ones
approach and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by Wickham.
 
"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he,
as he joined her.
 
"You certainly do," she replied with a smile "but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome."
 
"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends and
now we are better."
 
"True. Are the others coming out?"
 
"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen Pemberley."
 
She replied in the affirmative.
 
"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the
old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
me. But of course she did not mention my name to you."
 
"Yes, she did."
 
"And what did she say?"
 
"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid hadnot turned
out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented."
 
"Certainly," he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him but he soon afterwards said
 
"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other
several times. I wonder what he can be doing there."
 
"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said
Elizabeth. "It must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year."
 
"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had."
 
"Yes he introduced us to his sister."
 
"And do you like her?"
 
"Very much."
 
"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad
you liked her. I hope she will turn out well."
 
"I dare say she will she has got over the most trying age."
 
"Did you go by the village of Kympton?"
 
"I do not recollect that we did."
 
"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A
most delightful place!Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited
me in every respect."
 
"How should you have liked making sermons?"
 
"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,
and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to
repinebut, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The
quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas
of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in Kent?"
 
"I have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."
 
"You have. Yes, there was something in _that_ I told you so from the
first, you may remember."
 
"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermonmaking was not
so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly."
 
"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."
 
They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him and unwilling, for her sisters sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a goodhumoured smile
 
"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let
us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one
mind."
 
She held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.
 
 
 
Chapter 53
 
 
Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.
 
The day of his and Lydias departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.
 
"Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"
 
"Oh, lord! I dont know. Not these two or three years, perhaps."
 
"Write to me very often, my dear."
 
"As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for
writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to
do."
 
Mr. Wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes. He
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.
 
"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, "as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to
us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw."
 
The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.
 
"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with
ones friends. One seems so forlorn without them."
 
"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said
Elizabeth. "It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single."
 
"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,
but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off. If
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."
 
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper
at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several
weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and
smiled and shook her head by turns.
 
"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister," for Mrs.
Phillips first brought her the news. "Well, so much the better. Not
that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am
sure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome
to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?
But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"
 
"You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs. Nicholls was in
Meryton last night I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true. He
comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was
going to the butchers, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed."
 
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
Elizabeth but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said
 
"I saw you look at me today, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report and I know I appeared distressed. But dont imagine it was from
any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that
I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect
me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes
alone because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of
_myself_, but I dread other peoples remarks."
 
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in
Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial
to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friends permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.
 
"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot
come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself."
 
In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.
 
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.
 
"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "you
will wait on him of course."
 
"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in
nothing, and I will not be sent on a fools errand again."
 
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
Netherfield.
 
"Tis an etiquette I despise," said he. "If he wants our society,
let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours
in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
again."
 
"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
on him. But, however, that shant prevent my asking him to dine here, I
am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will
make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for
him."
 
Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before
_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,
 
"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister. "It
would be nothing I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well
but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she
says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"
 
"I wish I could say anything to comfort you," replied Elizabeth "but it
is wholly out of my power. You must feel it and the usual satisfaction
of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have
always so much."
 
Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent
hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his
arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressingroom window,
enter the paddock and ride towards the house.
 
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the windowshe looked,she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.
 
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty "who can it be?"
 
"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose I am sure I do not
know."
 
"La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before. Mr. whatshisname. That tall, proud man."
 
"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of
Mr. Bingleys will always be welcome here, to be sure but else I must
say that I hate the very sight of him."
 
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little
of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable
enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as Mr. Bingleys friend, without being heard by either
of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.
Gardiners letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,
and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as
what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his comingat his
coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in Derbyshire.
 
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.
 
"Let me first see how he behaves," said she "it will then be early
enough for expectation."
 
She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of
her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the
gentlemens appearing, her colour increased yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.
 
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She
had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual and,
she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mothers
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture.
 
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.
Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend.
 
Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter
the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,
was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.
 
Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He
was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but
it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,
when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without
bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally, unable to resist
the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often
found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but
the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when
they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry
with herself for being so.
 
"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she. "Yet why did he come?"
 
She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.
 
She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.
 
"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs. Bennet.
 
He readily agreed to it.
 
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas but, however, I hope
it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my
own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know
though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, Lately,
George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet, without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.
It was my brother Gardiners drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?"
 
Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.
 
"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,"
continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to
Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay
I do not know how long. His regiment is there for I suppose you have
heard of his leaving the shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves."
 
Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such
misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.
 
"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley," said her mother,
"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.
Bennets manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you."
 
Elizabeths misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt
that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for
moments of such painful confusion.
 
"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to
be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
one or the other again!"
 
Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her
former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He
found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured, and
as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.
 
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
Longbourn in a few days time.
 
"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley," she added, "for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see and I assure
you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement."
 
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.
 
Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there that day but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man
on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride
of one who had ten thousand a year.
 
 
 
Chapter 54
 
 
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more. Mr. Darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her.
 
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she,
"did he come at all?"
 
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.
 
"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If
he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will
think no more about him."
 
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her
better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.
 
"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly
seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance."
 
"Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly. "Oh, Jane,
take care."
 
"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?"
 
"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever."
 
                              
 
They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday and Mrs. Bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hours visit, had
revived.
 
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn and the two
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality
as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the
diningroom, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore
to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile it was
decided. He placed himself by her.
 
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.
He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of halflaughing
alarm.
 
His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Janes happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in
no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table
could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mothers ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeths mind
and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell
him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the
family.
 
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious
and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawingroom, before the
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her
uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.
 
"If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for
ever."
 
The gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her
which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemens approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper
 
"The men shant come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them
do we?"
 
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with
her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough
to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for
being so silly!
 
"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"
 
She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself and she seized the opportunity of saying
 
"Is your sister at Pemberley still?"
 
"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."
 
"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?"
 
"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,
these three weeks."
 
She could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence and, at last, on the young ladys whispering
to Elizabeth again, he walked away.
 
When the teathings were removed, and the cardtables placed, the ladies
all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,
when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her
mothers rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.
 
Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.
 
"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What
say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The
venison was roasted to a turnand everybody said they never saw so
fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
Lucases last week and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done and I suppose he has two or three French
cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And
what do you think she said besides? Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her
at Netherfield at last. She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good
a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome I like them prodigiously."
 
Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits she had seen enough of
Bingleys behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.
 
"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. "The
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we
may often meet again."
 
Elizabeth smiled.
 
"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am
perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had
any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed
with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing, than any other man."
 
"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment."
 
"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"
 
"And how impossible in others!"
 
"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge?"
 
"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive
me and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante."
 
 
 
Chapter 55
 
 
A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.
 
"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky."
 
He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc. and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.
 
"Can you come tomorrow?"
 
Yes, he had no engagement at all for tomorrow and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.
 
He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them
dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters room, in her dressing
gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out
 
"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is comeMr. Bingley is
come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss
Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss
Lizzys hair."
 
"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane "but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."
 
"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!
Where is your sash, my dear?"
 
But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.
 
The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of
the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her and when at last
Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma? What do
you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?"
 
"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you." She then sat still
five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, "Come here, my love, I want to
speak to you," took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look
at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her
entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.
Bennet halfopened the door and called out
 
"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."
 
Elizabeth was forced to go.
 
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know" said her mother, as
soon as she was in the hall. "Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in
my dressingroom."
 
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawingroom.
 
Mrs. Bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of the
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.
 
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.
Bennets means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.
 
After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed
between the sisters concerning Bingley but Elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy
returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans
concurrence.
 
Bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and Mr. Bennet spent
the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption
or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into
silence and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the
other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner
and in the evening Mrs. Bennets invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mothers schemes.
 
But on returning to the drawingroom, when her letter was finished, she
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her
sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would
have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough but _hers_ she
thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either and
Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room.
 
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.
 
"Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!
why is not everybody as happy?"
 
Elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,
a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said for the present.
 
"I must go instantly to my mother" she cried. "I would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it
from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family! how shall I bear so much happiness!"
 
She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.
 
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.
 
"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friends anxious
circumspection! of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance! the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"
 
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.
 
"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.
 
"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say."
 
He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes
and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed
her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with
great cordiality and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Janes perfections
and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding, and superexcellent disposition of
Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.
 
It was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of
Miss Bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when
Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed
how really happy he was.
 
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter, and said
 
"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman."
 
Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.
 
"You are a good girl" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your
doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on so
easy, that every servant will cheat you and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income."
 
"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
unpardonable in me."
 
"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you
talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely
more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so
happy! I am sure I shant get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it
would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!"
 
Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her
favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.
 
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield and Kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.
 
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself
obliged to accept.
 
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for
while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours
of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he
always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of
relief.
 
"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me that he
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed
it possible."
 
"I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth. "But how did he account for
it?"
 
"It must have been his sisters doing. They were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,
as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again though we
can never be what we once were to each other."
 
"That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever
heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss Bingleys pretended regard."
 
"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!"
 
"He made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his
modesty."
 
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased
to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for,
though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she
knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.
 
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried
Jane. "Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but
such another man for you!"
 
"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself and, perhaps, if I have very
good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time."
 
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,
and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in Meryton.
 
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.
 
 
 
Chapter 56
 
 
One morning, about a week after Bingleys engagement with Jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
diningroom, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up
the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses
were post and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
 
They were of course all intending to be surprised but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of Mrs.
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.
 
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to Elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother on her ladyships entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.
 
Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,
 
"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your
mother."
 
Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.
 
"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters."
 
"Yes, madam," said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.
"She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man
who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family."
 
"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence.
 
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say but I
assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucass."
 
"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer the windows are full west."
 
Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then
added
 
"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and
Mrs. Collins well."
 
"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last."
 
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.
 
Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating anything and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,
 
"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company."
 
"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and show her ladyship about the
different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."
 
Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the
hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the diningparlour and
drawingroom, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
looking rooms, walked on.
 
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
waitingwoman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.
 
"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in
her face.
 
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner
 
"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
come."
 
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.
 
"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here."
 
"Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to
know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved
on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you."
 
"If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?"
 
"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."
 
"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth
coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it if, indeed, such a report
is in existence."
 
"If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?"
 
"I never heard that it was."
 
"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?"
 
"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may
ask questions which I shall not choose to answer."
 
"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"
 
"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."
 
"It ought to be so it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You
may have drawn him in."
 
"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."
 
"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."
 
"But you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this,
ever induce me to be explicit."
 
"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is
engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?"
 
"Only this that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me."
 
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied
 
"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned
the union and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his
tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest
hours he was destined for his cousin?"
 
"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is
no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not
be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to
marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither
by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"
 
"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,
Miss Bennet, interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
Your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us."
 
"These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth. "But the wife of Mr.
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine."
 
"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that
score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came
here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will
I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any persons
whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."
 
"_That_ will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable
but it will have no effect on me."
 
"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal
side, from the same noble line and, on the fathers, from respectable,
honourable, and ancientthough untitledfamilies. Their fortune on
both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them?
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,
or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in
which you have been brought up."
 
"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere. He is a gentleman I am a gentlemans daughter so far we are
equal."
 
"True. You _are_ a gentlemans daughter. But who was your mother?
Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition."
 
"Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."
 
"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"
 
Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
moments deliberation
 
"I am not."
 
Lady Catherine seemed pleased.
 
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"
 
"I will make no promise of the kind."
 
"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more
reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that
I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the
assurance I require."
 
"And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry
your daughter but would my giving you the wishedfor promise make their
marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would
my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have
supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the
application was illjudged. You have widely mistaken my character, if
you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your
nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,
therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject."
 
"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am
no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous
elopement. I know it all that the young mans marrying her was a
patchedup business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is
such a girl to be my nephews sister? Is her husband, is the son of his
late fathers steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!of what are
you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"
 
"You can now have nothing further to say," she resentfully answered.
"You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to
the house."
 
And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.
 
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"
 
"Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments."
 
"You are then resolved to have him?"
 
"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."
 
"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."
 
"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either
would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moments
concernand the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn."
 
"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.
I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you
reasonable but, depend upon it, I will carry my point."
 
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, "I take no leave
of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve
no such attention. I am most seriously displeased."
 
Elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom, to ask why Lady
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.
 
"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."
 
"She is a very finelooking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were
well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"
 
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.
 
 
 
Chapter 57
 
 
The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome nor could she, for many
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.
Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report
of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply
the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours
at Lucas Lodge, therefore for through their communication with the
Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine, had
only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked
forward to as possible at some future time.
 
In revolving Lady Catherines expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew and how _he_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do and it
was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.
 
If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady
Catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.
 
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to understand
it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his
constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all."
 
                              
 
The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennets curiosity and
Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.
 
The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.
 
"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you come into my room."
 
She followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to
tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it
might be from Lady Catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.
 
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He
then said,
 
"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink
of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest."
 
The colour now rushed into Elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself when her father continued
 
"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins."
 
"From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?"
 
"Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which, it seems, he has been told by some of the goodnatured, gossiping
Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows Having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another
of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may
be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in
this land.
 
"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" This young
gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate
closure with this gentlemans proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of.
 
"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out
 
"My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine
that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with
a friendly eye.
 
"_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie
more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his
life! It is admirable!"
 
Elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.
 
"Are you not diverted?"
 
"Oh! yes. Pray read on."
 
"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion when it became apparent, that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned. Mr.
Collins moreover adds, I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydias sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an
encouragement of vice and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them,
as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their
names to be mentioned in your hearing. That is his notion of Christian
forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlottes
situation, and his expectation of a young olivebranch. But, Lizzy, you
look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _missish_,
I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn?"
 
"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted. But it is so
strange!"
 
"Yes_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr. Collinss correspondence for any
consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving
him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my soninlaw. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?"
 
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by
his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she
would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
what he said of Mr. Darcys indifference, and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.
 
 
 
Chapter 58
 
 
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherines
visit. The gentlemen arrived early and, before Mrs. Bennet had time
to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat
in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the
habit of walking Mary could never spare time but the remaining five
set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others
to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy
were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either Kitty
was too much afraid of him to talk Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same.
 
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon
Maria and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
high, she immediately said
 
"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature and, for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my
poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest
of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."
 
"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner
was so little to be trusted."
 
"You must not blame my aunt. Lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter and, of course, I could
not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them."
 
"If you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone.
That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your
_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought
only of _you_."
 
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,
her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me. If your
feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever."
 
Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable.
 
They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to
be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through
London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with Elizabeth dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter which, in her ladyships apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise
from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.
 
"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."
 
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough
of my frankness to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so
abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations."
 
"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your
accusations were illfounded, formed on mistaken premises, my
behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was
unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence."
 
"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening," said Elizabeth. "The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable but since then, we have both, I hope, improved
in civility."
 
"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your
reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner. Those were your words. You know not, you can
scarcely conceive, how they have tortured methough it was some time,
I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."
 
"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way."
 
"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce you to accept me."
 
"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at
all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."
 
Darcy mentioned his letter. "Did it," said he, "did it soon make you
think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?"
 
She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed.
 
"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part
especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the
power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me."
 
"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies."
 
"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit."
 
"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The
adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now
so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some
of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure."
 
"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of
innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude
which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish
being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I
was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I
was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
Unfortunately an only son for many years an only child, I was spoilt
by my parents, who, though good themselves my father, particularly, all
that was benevolent and amiable, allowed, encouraged, almost taught
me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family
circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least
to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I
was, from eight to eight and twenty and such I might still have been
but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You
taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you,
I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.
You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman
worthy of being pleased."
 
"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"
 
"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses."
 
"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure
you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me
wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"
 
"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction."
 
"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at
Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?"
 
"No indeed I felt nothing but surprise."
 
"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due."
 
"My object then," replied Darcy, "was to show you, by every civility in
my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past and I hoped to
obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes
introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an
hour after I had seen you."
 
He then told her of Georgianas delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.
 
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each, to be dwelt on farther.
 
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.
 
"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with
their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.
 
"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth.
 
"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."
 
"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much." And
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.
 
"On the evening before my going to London," said he, "I made a
confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I
told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had
the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."
 
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.
 
"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"
 
"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which I had lately made here and I was convinced of her affection."
 
"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him."
 
"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was
angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sisters sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me
now."
 
Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful
friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked
herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at,
and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness
of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he
continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they
parted.
 
 
 
Chapter 59
 
 
"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room,
and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to
say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge. She coloured as she spoke but neither that, nor anything
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.
 
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy
than _felt_ herself to be so for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt
in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no
one liked him but Jane and even feared that with the others it was a
dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.
 
At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennets general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.
 
"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,
you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible."
 
"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you and
I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am
in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are
engaged."
 
Jane looked at her doubtingly. "Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much
you dislike him."
 
"You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as
these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself."
 
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth.
 
"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," cried
Jane. "My dear, dear Lizzy, I wouldI do congratulate youbut are you
certain? forgive the questionare you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?"
 
"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,
Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?"
 
"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you
really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than
marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?"
 
"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
tell you all."
 
"What do you mean?"
 
"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am
afraid you will be angry."
 
"My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let
me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me
how long you have loved him?"
 
"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at Pemberley."
 
Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances
of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
further to wish.
 
"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself.
I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you,
I must always have esteemed him but now, as Bingleys friend and your
husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you
tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know
of it to another, not to you."
 
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling
to mention Bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer
conceal from her his share in Lydias marriage. All was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.
 
                              
 
"Good gracious!" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, "if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with
our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here? I had no notion but he would go ashooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingleys
way."
 
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.
 
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information
and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again today?"
 
"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs. Bennet, "to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has
never seen the view."
 
"It may do very well for the others," replied Mr. Bingley "but I am
sure it will be too much for Kitty. Wont it, Kitty?" Kitty owned that
she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see
the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went
up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying
 
"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it it is
all for Janes sake, you know and there is no occasion for talking
to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to
inconvenience."
 
During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennets consent should be
asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mothers. She could not determine how her mother
would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit
to her sense and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear
the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.
 
                              
 
In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme. She did not fear her fathers opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy and that it should be through her meansthat _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of herwas a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty and, while
pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he
wants you in the library." She was gone directly.
 
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
"Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?"
 
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give
but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,
of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.
 
"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.
But will they make you happy?"
 
"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my
indifference?"
 
"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man but
this would be nothing if you really liked him."
 
"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him.
Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not
know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms."
 
"Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent. He is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he
condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know
your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked
up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape
discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are
about."
 
Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply and
at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object
of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of
him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection
was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months
suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did
conquer her fathers incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.
 
"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to
say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with
you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy."
 
To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.
 
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellows debts, and got him
his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble
and economy. Had it been your uncles doing, I must and _would_ have
paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way. I shall offer to pay him tomorrow he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."
 
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
Mr. Collinss letter and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to gosaying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come
for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."
 
Elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and, after
half an hours quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer
anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.
 
When her mother went up to her dressingroom at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary
for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to
utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could
comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit
what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a
lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in
her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.
 
"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would
have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
and how great you will be! What pinmoney, what jewels, what carriages
you will have! Janes is nothing to itnothing at all. I am so
pleasedso happy. Such a charming man!so handsome! so tall!Oh, my
dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I
hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing
that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted."
 
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.
 
"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more! Tis as good as a Lord! And a
special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,
that I may have it tomorrow."
 
This was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations
consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow
passed off much better than she expected for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended soninlaw that she ventured not to speak to
him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her
deference for his opinion.
 
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.
 
"I admire all my three sonsinlaw highly," said he. "Wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as Janes."
 
 
 
Chapter 60
 
 
Elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. "How could
you begin?" said she. "I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first
place?"
 
"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I
knew that I _had_ begun."
 
"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my mannersmy behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere
did you admire me for my impertinence?"
 
"For the liveliness of your mind, I did."
 
"You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really
amiable, you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you. ThereI have saved you the trouble of accounting for
it and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of mebut nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love."
 
"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was
ill at Netherfield?"
 
"Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it
by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?"
 
"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."
 
"But I was embarrassed."
 
"And so was I."
 
"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."
 
"A man who had felt less, might."
 
"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.
_Too much_, I am afraid for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the
subject. This will never do."
 
"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady
Catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour
to wait for any opening of yours. My aunts intelligence had given me
hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing."
 
"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to
Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?
or had you intended any more serious consequence?"
 
"My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I
might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,
and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made."
 
"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to
befall her?"
 
"I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it
ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be
done directly."
 
"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."
 
From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy
had been overrated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiners
long letter but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and
aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows
 
"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,
for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars but to say the
truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.
But _now_ suppose as much as you choose give a loose rein to your
fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the
subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you
cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a
great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again,
for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your
idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I
am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so
before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane she
only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that
he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.
Yours, etc."
 
Mr. Darcys letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style and still
different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply
to his last.
 
"DEAR SIR,
 
"I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon
be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.
 
"Yours sincerely, etc."
 
Miss Bingleys congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even
to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was
affected and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.
 
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,
was as sincere as her brothers in sending it. Four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.
 
Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations
to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this
sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered
so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter, that
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of
her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St. Jamess, with very decent composure. If he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.
 
Mrs. Phillipss vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his
forbearance and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingleys good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep
him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing
to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
Pemberley.
 
 
 
Chapter 61
 
 
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride
she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may
be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the
accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many
of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,
amiable, wellinformed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it
was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity
in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.
 
Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in
going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.
 
Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.
 
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a
temper as Lydia and, removed from the influence of Lydias example,
she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydias
society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.
 
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennets being quite
unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.
 
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that
Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every
thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received
from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this
effect
 
"MY DEAR LIZZY,
 
"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear
Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so
rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not
think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.
Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year but however,
do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.
 
"Yours, etc."
 
As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for
her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and
in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her.
 
Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for
Elizabeths sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in London or Bath and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even Bingleys good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.
 
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcys marriage but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to Elizabeth.
 
Pemberley was now Georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each
other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of Elizabeth though at first she often listened with
an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of
talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen
in her way. By Elizabeths instructions, she began to comprehend that
a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.
 
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeths persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation
and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait
on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.
 
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.
Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.
 
The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex.  Their estate
was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of
their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so
respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their
surrounding acquaintance.  The late owner of this estate was a single
man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his
life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister.  But her
death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great
alteration in his home for to supply her loss, he invited and received
into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal
inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to
bequeath it.  In the society of his nephew and niece, and their
children, the old Gentlemans days were comfortably spent.  His
attachment to them all increased.  The constant attention of Mr. and
Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from
interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid
comfort which his age could receive and the cheerfulness of the
children added a relish to his existence.
 
By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son by his present
lady, three daughters.  The son, a steady respectable young man, was
amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,
and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.  By his own
marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his
wealth.  To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not
so really important as to his sisters for their fortune, independent
of what might arise to them from their fathers inheriting that
property, could be but small.  Their mother had nothing, and their
father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal for the
remaining moiety of his first wifes fortune was also secured to her
child, and he had only a lifeinterest in it.
 
The old gentleman died his will was read, and like almost every other
will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure.  He was neither so
unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephewbut
he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the
bequest.  Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife
and daughters than for himself or his sonbut to his son, and his
sons son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as
to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear
to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or
by any sale of its valuable woods.  The whole was tied up for the
benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and
mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by
such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three
years old an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his
own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh
all the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received
from his niece and her daughters.  He meant not to be unkind, however,
and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a
thousand pounds apiece.
 
Mr. Dashwoods disappointment was, at first, severe but his temper was
cheerful and sanguine and he might reasonably hope to live many years,
and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce
of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate
improvement.  But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was
his only one twelvemonth.  He survived his uncle no longer and ten
thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for
his widow and daughters.
 
His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr.
Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness
could command, the interest of his motherinlaw and sisters.
 
Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the
family but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at
such a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make
them comfortable.  His father was rendered easy by such an assurance,
and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might
prudently be in his power to do for them.
 
He was not an illdisposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted
and rather selfish is to be illdisposed but he was, in general, well
respected for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of
his ordinary duties.  Had he married a more amiable woman, he might
have been made still more respectable than he washe might even have
been made amiable himself for he was very young when he married, and
very fond of his wife.  But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature
of himselfmore narrowminded and selfish.
 
When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to
increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand
pounds apiece.  He then really thought himself equal to it.  The
prospect of four thousand ayear, in addition to his present income,
besides the remaining half of his own mothers fortune, warmed his
heart, and made him feel capable of generosity. "Yes, he would give
them three thousand pounds it would be liberal and handsome! It would
be enough to make them completely easy.  Three thousand pounds! he
could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience." He
thought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did
not repent.
 
No sooner was his fathers funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,
without sending any notice of her intention to her motherinlaw,
arrived with her child and their attendants.  No one could dispute her
right to come the house was her husbands from the moment of his
fathers decease but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the
greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwoods situation, with only common
feelings, must have been highly unpleasingbut in HER mind there was
a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of
the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of
immovable disgust.  Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with
any of her husbands family but she had had no opportunity, till the
present, of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of
other people she could act when occasion required it.
 
So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so
earnestly did she despise her daughterinlaw for it, that, on the
arrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had
not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the
propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three children
determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach
with their brother.
 
Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed
a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified
her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and
enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,
that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led
to imprudence.  She had an excellent hearther disposition was
affectionate, and her feelings were strong but she knew how to govern
them it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn and which
one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.
 
Mariannes abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinors.
She was sensible and clever but eager in everything her sorrows, her
joys, could have no moderation.  She was generous, amiable,
interesting she was everything but prudent.  The resemblance between
her and her mother was strikingly great.
 
Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sisters sensibility but
by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished.  They encouraged each
other now in the violence of their affliction.  The agony of grief
which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought
for, was created again and again.  They gave themselves up wholly to
their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that
could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in
future.  Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted but still she could
struggle, she could exert herself.  She could consult with her brother,
could receive her sisterinlaw on her arrival, and treat her with
proper attention and could strive to rouse her mother to similar
exertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance.
 
Margaret, the other sister, was a goodhumored, welldisposed girl but
as she had already imbibed a good deal of Mariannes romance, without
having much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal
her sisters at a more advanced period of life.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 2
 
 
Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland and her
mother and sistersinlaw were degraded to the condition of visitors.
As such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility and by
her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody
beyond himself, his wife, and their child.  He really pressed them,
with some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home and, as no
plan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she
could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his
invitation was accepted.
 
A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former
delight, was exactly what suited her mind.  In seasons of cheerfulness,
no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater
degree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness
itself.  But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,
and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.
 
Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended
to do for his sisters.  To take three thousand pounds from the fortune
of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most
dreadful degree.  She begged him to think again on the subject.  How
could he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child too,
of so large a sum?  And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods,
who were related to him only by half blood, which she considered as no
relationship at all, have on his generosity to so large an amount.  It
was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist
between the children of any man by different marriages and why was he
to ruin himself, and their poor little Harry, by giving away all his
money to his half sisters?
 
"It was my fathers last request to me," replied her husband, "that I
should assist his widow and daughters."
 
"He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say ten to one but he
was lightheaded at the time.  Had he been in his right senses, he
could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half
your fortune from your own child."
 
"He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny he only
requested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their
situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do.  Perhaps it
would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself.  He could
hardly suppose I should neglect them.  But as he required the promise,
I could not do less than give it at least I thought so at the time.
The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed.  Something
must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new
home."
 
"Well, then, LET something be done for them but THAT something need
not be three thousand pounds.  Consider," she added, "that when the
money is once parted with, it never can return.  Your sisters will
marry, and it will be gone for ever.  If, indeed, it could be restored
to our poor little boy"
 
"Why, to be sure," said her husband, very gravely, "that would make
great difference.  The time may come when Harry will regret that so
large a sum was parted with.  If he should have a numerous family, for
instance, it would be a very convenient addition."
 
"To be sure it would."
 
"Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum were
diminished one half.Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious
increase to their fortunes!"
 
"Oh! beyond anything great!  What brother on earth would do half so
much for his sisters, even if REALLY his sisters!  And as it isonly
half blood!But you have such a generous spirit!"
 
"I would not wish to do any thing mean," he replied.  "One had rather,
on such occasions, do too much than too little.  No one, at least, can
think I have not done enough for them even themselves, they can hardly
expect more."
 
"There is no knowing what THEY may expect," said the lady, "but we are
not to think of their expectations the question is, what you can
afford to do."
 
"Certainlyand I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds
apiece.  As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each have
about three thousand pounds on their mothers deatha very comfortable
fortune for any young woman."
 
"To be sure it is and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no
addition at all.  They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst
them.  If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do
not, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten
thousand pounds."
 
"That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the
whole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother
while she lives, rather than for themsomething of the annuity kind I
mean.My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself.
A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable."
 
His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to this
plan.
 
"To be sure," said she, "it is better than parting with fifteen hundred
pounds at once.  But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years
we shall be completely taken in."
 
"Fifteen years! my dear Fanny her life cannot be worth half that
purchase."
 
"Certainly not but if you observe, people always live for ever when
there is an annuity to be paid them and she is very stout and healthy,
and hardly forty.  An annuity is a very serious business it comes over
and over every year, and there is no getting rid of it.  You are not
aware of what you are doing.  I have known a great deal of the trouble
of annuities for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to
old superannuated servants by my fathers will, and it is amazing how
disagreeable she found it.  Twice every year these annuities were to be
paid and then there was the trouble of getting it to them and then
one of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to be
no such thing.  My mother was quite sick of it.  Her income was not her
own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it and it was the more
unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been
entirely at my mothers disposal, without any restriction whatever.  It
has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I would
not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world."
 
"It is certainly an unpleasant thing," replied Mr. Dashwood, "to have
those kind of yearly drains on ones income.  Ones fortune, as your
mother justly says, is NOT ones own.  To be tied down to the regular
payment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable it
takes away ones independence."
 
"Undoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it.  They think
themselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises
no gratitude at all.  If I were you, whatever I did should be done at
my own discretion entirely.  I would not bind myself to allow them any
thing yearly.  It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a
hundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses."
 
"I believe you are right, my love it will be better that there should
be no annuity in the case whatever I may give them occasionally will
be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they
would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger
income, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the
year.  It will certainly be much the best way.  A present of fifty
pounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for
money, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my father."
 
"To be sure it will.  Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within
myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at
all.  The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might
be reasonably expected of you for instance, such as looking out for a
comfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things,
and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever they
are in season.  Ill lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed,
it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.  Do but consider,
my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your motherinlaw
and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds,
besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which
brings them in fifty pounds a year apiece, and, of course, they will
pay their mother for their board out of it.  Altogether, they will have
five hundred ayear amongst them, and what on earth can four women want
for more than that?They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will
be nothing at all.  They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly
any servants they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of
any kind!  Only conceive how comfortable they will be!  Five hundred a
year! I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it and as
to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it.  They will
be much more able to give YOU something."
 
"Upon my word," said Mr. Dashwood, "I believe you are perfectly right.
My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than
what you say.  I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil
my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you
have described.  When my mother removes into another house my services
shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can.  Some little
present of furniture too may be acceptable then."
 
"Certainly," returned Mrs. John Dashwood.  "But, however, ONE thing
must be considered.  When your father and mother moved to Norland,
though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and
linen was saved, and is now left to your mother.  Her house will
therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it."
 
"That is a material consideration undoubtedly.  A valuable legacy
indeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant
addition to our own stock here."
 
"Yes and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what
belongs to this house.  A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, for
any place THEY can ever afford to live in.  But, however, so it is.
Your father thought only of THEM.  And I must say this that you owe no
particular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes for we very
well know that if he could, he would have left almost everything in the
world to THEM."
 
This argument was irresistible.  It gave to his intentions whatever of
decision was wanting before and he finally resolved, that it would be
absolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for the
widow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts as
his own wife pointed out.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 3
 
 
Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months not from any
disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased
to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while for when
her spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some other
exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy
remembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her
inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland for
to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.  But she could
hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and
ease, and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadier
judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income, which
her mother would have approved.
 
Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on
the part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his last
earthly reflections.  She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no
more than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her
daughters sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was
persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her in
affluence.  For their brothers sake, too, for the sake of his own
heart, she rejoiced and she reproached herself for being unjust to his
merit before, in believing him incapable of generosity.  His attentive
behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare
was dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied on the
liberality of his intentions.
 
The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt for
her daughterinlaw, was very much increased by the farther knowledge
of her character, which half a years residence in her family afforded
and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal
affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might have found it
impossible to have lived together so long, had not a particular
circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility, according to
the opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters continuance at Norland.
 
This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and
the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentlemanlike and pleasing young
man, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sisters
establishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part of
his time there.
 
Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of
interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died
very rich and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence,
for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depended on the
will of his mother.  But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either
consideration.  It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,
that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality.
It was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortune
should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of
disposition and that Elinors merit should not be acknowledged by
every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.
 
Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any
peculiar graces of person or address.  He was not handsome, and his
manners required intimacy to make them pleasing.  He was too diffident
to do justice to himself but when his natural shyness was overcome,
his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart.
His understanding was good, and his education had given it solid
improvement.  But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to
answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see him
distinguishedasthey hardly knew what.  They wanted him to make a
fine figure in the world in some manner or other.  His mother wished to
interest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to
see him connected with some of the great men of the day.  Mrs. John
Dashwood wished it likewise but in the mean while, till one of these
superior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted her
ambition to see him driving a barouche.  But Edward had no turn for
great men or barouches.  All his wishes centered in domestic comfort
and the quiet of private life.  Fortunately he had a younger brother
who was more promising.
 
Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged
much of Mrs. Dashwoods attention for she was, at that time, in such
affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects.  She saw
only that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it.  He
did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by illtimed conversation.
She was first called to observe and approve him farther, by a
reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference
between him and his sister.  It was a contrast which recommended him
most forcibly to her mother.
 
"It is enough," said she "to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough.
It implies everything amiable.  I love him already."
 
"I think you will like him," said Elinor, "when you know more of him."
 
"Like him!" replied her mother with a smile.  "I feel no sentiment of
approbation inferior to love."
 
"You may esteem him."
 
"I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love."
 
Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him.  Her manners
were attaching, and soon banished his reserve.  She speedily
comprehended all his merits the persuasion of his regard for Elinor
perhaps assisted her penetration but she really felt assured of his
worth and even that quietness of manner, which militated against all
her established ideas of what a young mans address ought to be, was no
longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper
affectionate.
 
No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to
Elinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, and
looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.
 
"In a few months, my dear Marianne." said she, "Elinor will, in all
probability be settled for life.  We shall miss her but SHE will be
happy."
 
"Oh! Mama, how shall we do without her?"
 
"My love, it will be scarcely a separation.  We shall live within a few
miles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives.  You will
gain a brother, a real, affectionate brother.  I have the highest
opinion in the world of Edwards heart.  But you look grave, Marianne
do you disapprove your sisters choice?"
 
"Perhaps," said Marianne, "I may consider it with some surprise.
Edward is very amiable, and I love him tenderly.  But yethe is not
the kind of young manthere is something wantinghis figure is not
striking it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man
who could seriously attach my sister.  His eyes want all that spirit,
that fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence.  And besides
all this, I am afraid, Mama, he has no real taste.  Music seems
scarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinors drawings very
much, it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their
worth.  It is evident, in spite of his frequent attention to her while
she draws, that in fact he knows nothing of the matter.  He admires as
a lover, not as a connoisseur.  To satisfy me, those characters must be
united.  I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every
point coincide with my own.  He must enter into all my feelings the
same books, the same music must charm us both.  Oh! mama, how
spiritless, how tame was Edwards manner in reading to us last night!
I felt for my sister most severely.  Yet she bore it with so much
composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it.  I could hardly keep my
seat.  To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost
driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such
dreadful indifference!" "He would certainly have done more justice to
simple and elegant prose.  I thought so at the time but you WOULD give
him Cowper."
 
"Nay, Mama, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!but we must allow
for difference of taste.  Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she
may overlook it, and be happy with him.  But it would have broke MY
heart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility.
Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I
shall never see a man whom I can really love.  I require so much!  He
must have all Edwards virtues, and his person and manners must
ornament his goodness with every possible charm."
 
"Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen.  It is yet too early in
life to despair of such a happiness.  Why should you be less fortunate
than your mother?  In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your
destiny be different from hers!"
 
 
 
CHAPTER 4
 
 
"What a pity it is, Elinor," said Marianne, "that Edward should have no
taste for drawing."
 
"No taste for drawing!" replied Elinor, "why should you think so? He
does not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing the
performances of other people, and I assure you he is by no means
deficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of
improving it.  Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he
would have drawn very well.  He distrusts his own judgment in such
matters so much, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any
picture but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, which
in general direct him perfectly right."
 
Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject but
the kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by the
drawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous delight,
which, in her opinion, could alone be called taste.  Yet, though
smiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured her sister for that
blind partiality to Edward which produced it.
 
"I hope, Marianne," continued Elinor, "you do not consider him as
deficient in general taste.  Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot,
for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial, and if THAT were your
opinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him."
 
Marianne hardly knew what to say.  She would not wound the feelings of
her sister on any account, and yet to say what she did not believe was
impossible.  At length she replied
 
"Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him is not in every thing
equal to your sense of his merits.  I have not had so many
opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind, his
inclinations and tastes, as you have but I have the highest opinion in
the world of his goodness and sense.  I think him every thing that is
worthy and amiable."
 
"I am sure," replied Elinor, with a smile, "that his dearest friends
could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that.  I do not
perceive how you could express yourself more warmly."
 
Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased.
 
"Of his sense and his goodness," continued Elinor, "no one can, I
think, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him in
unreserved conversation.  The excellence of his understanding and his
principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps
him silent.  You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth.
But of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have from
peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself.  He and I
have been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been
wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother.  I
have seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heard
his opinion on subjects of literature and taste and, upon the whole, I
venture to pronounce that his mind is wellinformed, enjoyment of books
exceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just and
correct, and his taste delicate and pure.  His abilities in every
respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person.
At first sight, his address is certainly not striking and his person
can hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, which
are uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, is
perceived.  At present, I know him so well, that I think him really
handsome or at least, almost so.  What say you, Marianne?"
 
"I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I do not now.  When
you tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection
in his face, than I now do in his heart."
 
Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she
had been betrayed into, in speaking of him.  She felt that Edward stood
very high in her opinion.  She believed the regard to be mutual but
she required greater certainty of it to make Mariannes conviction of
their attachment agreeable to her.  She knew that what Marianne and her
mother conjectured one moment, they believed the nextthat with them,
to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect.  She tried to explain
the real state of the case to her sister.
 
"I do not attempt to deny," said she, "that I think very highly of
himthat I greatly esteem, that I like him."
 
Marianne here burst forth with indignation
 
"Esteem him! Like him! Coldhearted Elinor! Oh!  worse than
coldhearted! Ashamed of being otherwise.  Use those words again, and I
will leave the room this moment."
 
Elinor could not help laughing.  "Excuse me," said she "and be assured
that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my
own feelings.  Believe them to be stronger than I have declared
believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicionthe
hope of his affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly.
But farther than this you must not believe.  I am by no means assured
of his regard for me.  There are moments when the extent of it seems
doubtful and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder at
my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, by
believing or calling it more than it is.  In my heart I feel
littlescarcely any doubt of his preference.  But there are other
points to be considered besides his inclination.  He is very far from
being independent.  What his mother really is we cannot know but, from
Fannys occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never
been disposed to think her amiable and I am very much mistaken if
Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in
his way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great
fortune or high rank."
 
Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother
and herself had outstripped the truth.
 
"And you really are not engaged to him!" said she.  "Yet it certainly
soon will happen.  But two advantages will proceed from this delay.  I
shall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity of
improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be
so indispensably necessary to your future felicity.  Oh! if he should
be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself, how
delightful it would be!"
 
Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister.  She could not
consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne
had believed it.  There was, at times, a want of spirits about him
which, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost as
unpromising.  A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need not
give him more than inquietude.  It would not be likely to produce that
dejection of mind which frequently attended him.  A more reasonable
cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the
indulgence of his affection.  She knew that his mother neither behaved
to him so as to make his home comfortable at present, nor to give him
any assurance that he might form a home for himself, without strictly
attending to her views for his aggrandizement.  With such a knowledge
as this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject.  She
was far from depending on that result of his preference of her, which
her mother and sister still considered as certain.  Nay, the longer
they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard
and sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more
than friendship.
 
But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceived
by his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time, which was
still more common, to make her uncivil.  She took the first
opportunity of affronting her motherinlaw on the occasion, talking to
her so expressively of her brothers great expectations, of Mrs.
Ferrarss resolution that both her sons should marry well, and of the
danger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN that
Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to
be calm.  She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, and
instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the
inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor
should not be exposed another week to such insinuations.
 
In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from the
post, which contained a proposal particularly well timed.  It was the
offer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of
her own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire.  The
letter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit
of friendly accommodation.  He understood that she was in need of a
dwelling and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage,
he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might
think necessary, if the situation pleased her.  He earnestly pressed
her, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to come with
her daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own residence, from
whence she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the houses
were in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortable
to her.  He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of
his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of
giving pleasure to his cousin more especially at a moment when she was
suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer
connections.  She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry.  Her
resolution was formed as she read.  The situation of Barton, in a
county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours
before, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every
possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first
recommendation.  To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an
evil it was an object of desire it was a blessing, in comparison of
the misery of continuing her daughterinlaws guest and to remove for
ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or
visit it while such a woman was its mistress.  She instantly wrote Sir
John Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptance
of his proposal and then hastened to shew both letters to her
daughters, that she might be secure of their approbation before her
answer were sent.
 
Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle
at some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their present
acquaintance.  On THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose
her mothers intention of removing into Devonshire.  The house, too, as
described by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so
uncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on either
point and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any charm
to her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland
beyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from
sending a letter of acquiescence.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 5
 
 
No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged herself
in the pleasure of announcing to her soninlaw and his wife that she
was provided with a house, and should incommode them no longer than till
every thing were ready for her inhabiting it. They heard her with
surprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing but her husband civilly hoped
that she would not be settled far from Norland. She had great
satisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire.Edward
turned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and, in a voice of surprise
and concern, which required no explanation to her, repeated,
"Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from hence! And to
what part of it?" She explained the situation. It was within four miles
northward of Exeter.
 
"It is but a cottage," she continued, "but I hope to see many of my
friends in it.  A room or two can easily be added and if my friends
find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will
find none in accommodating them."
 
She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood
to visit her at Barton and to Edward she gave one with still greater
affection.  Though her late conversation with her daughterinlaw had
made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than was
unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that
point to which it principally tended.  To separate Edward and Elinor
was as far from being her object as ever and she wished to show Mrs.
John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally
she disregarded her disapprobation of the match.
 
Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry
he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to
prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture.  He
really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion for the very
exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his
father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable. The furniture
was all sent around by water.  It chiefly consisted of household linen,
plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Mariannes.
Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh she could not
help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwoods income would be so
trifling in comparison with their own, she should have any handsome
article of furniture.
 
Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth it was ready furnished,
and she might have immediate possession.  No difficulty arose on either
side in the agreement and she waited only for the disposal of her
effects at Norland, and to determine her future household, before she
set off for the west and this, as she was exceedingly rapid in the
performance of everything that interested her, was soon done.The
horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his
death, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage,
she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest
daughter.  For the comfort of her children, had she consulted only her
own wishes, she would have kept it but the discretion of Elinor
prevailed.  HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to
three two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided from
amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland.
 
The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire,
to prepare the house for their mistresss arrival for as Lady
Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going
directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park and she
relied so undoubtingly on Sir Johns description of the house, as to
feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own.
Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by
the evident satisfaction of her daughterinlaw in the prospect of her
removal a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed
under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure.  Now was the
time when her soninlaws promise to his father might with particular
propriety be fulfilled.  Since he had neglected to do it on first
coming to the estate, their quitting his house might be looked on as
the most suitable period for its accomplishment.  But Mrs. Dashwood
began shortly to give over every hope of the kind, and to be convinced,
from the general drift of his discourse, that his assistance extended
no farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland.  He so
frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping, and of
the perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man of any consequence in
the world was beyond calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to
stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving
money away.
 
In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middletons
first letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their future
abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their
journey.
 
Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so
much beloved.  "Dear, dear Norland!" said Marianne, as she wandered
alone before the house, on the last evening of their being there "when
shall I cease to regret you!when learn to feel a home elsewhere!Oh!
happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this
spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!And you, ye
wellknown trees!but you will continue the same.No leaf will decay
because we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we
can observe you no longer!No you will continue the same unconscious
of the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of any
change in those who walk under your shade!But who will remain to
enjoy you?"
 
 
 
CHAPTER 6
 
 
The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a
disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant.  But as they
drew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of a
country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view
of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness.  It was a
pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture.  After winding
along it for more than a mile, they reached their own house.  A small
green court was the whole of its demesne in front and a neat wicket
gate admitted them into it.
 
As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact
but as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, the
roof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor were
the walls covered with honeysuckles.  A narrow passage led directly
through the house into the garden behind.  On each side of the entrance
was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square and beyond them were the
offices and the stairs.  Four bedrooms and two garrets formed the rest
of the house.  It had not been built many years and was in good repair.
In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!but the tears
which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon
dried away.  They were cheered by the joy of the servants on their
arrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.
It was very early in September the season was fine, and from first
seeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they received an
impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending
it to their lasting approbation.
 
The situation of the house was good.  High hills rose immediately
behind, and at no great distance on each side some of which were open
downs, the others cultivated and woody.  The village of Barton was
chiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the
cottage windows.  The prospect in front was more extensive it
commanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond.
The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that
direction under another name, and in another course, it branched out
again between two of the steepest of them.
 
With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the
whole well satisfied for though her former style of life rendered many
additions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was a
delight to her and she had at this time ready money enough to supply
all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments.  "As for the
house itself, to be sure," said she, "it is too small for our family,
but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present, as it
is too late in the year for improvements.  Perhaps in the spring, if I
have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may think about
building.  These parlors are both too small for such parties of our
friends as I hope to see often collected here and I have some thoughts
of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the
other, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance this,
with a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bedchamber
and garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage.  I could
wish the stairs were handsome.  But one must not expect every thing
though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them.  I
shall see how much I am beforehand with the world in the spring, and
we will plan our improvements accordingly."
 
In the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from the
savings of an income of five hundred ayear by a woman who never saved
in her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it
was and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns,
and endeavoring, by placing around them books and other possessions, to
form themselves a home.  Mariannes pianoforte was unpacked and
properly disposed of and Elinors drawings were affixed to the walls
of their sitting room.
 
In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast
the next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called to welcome
them to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from his own
house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient.  Sir
John Middleton was a good looking man about forty.  He had formerly
visited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young cousins to
remember him.  His countenance was thoroughly goodhumoured and his
manners were as friendly as the style of his letter.  Their arrival
seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort to be an
object of real solicitude to him.  He said much of his earnest desire
of their living in the most sociable terms with his family, and pressed
them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they were
better settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried to a
point of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give offence.
His kindness was not confined to words for within an hour after he
left them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from
the park, which was followed before the end of the day by a present of
game.  He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their letters to and
from the post for them, and would not be denied the satisfaction of
sending them his newspaper every day.
 
Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him, denoting her
intention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she could be assured
that her visit would be no inconvenience and as this message was
answered by an invitation equally polite, her ladyship was introduced
to them the next day.
 
They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much of
their comfort at Barton must depend and the elegance of her appearance
was favourable to their wishes.  Lady Middleton was not more than six
or seven and twenty her face was handsome, her figure tall and
striking, and her address graceful.  Her manners had all the elegance
which her husbands wanted.  But they would have been improved by some
share of his frankness and warmth and her visit was long enough to
detract something from their first admiration, by shewing that, though
perfectly wellbred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say for
herself beyond the most commonplace inquiry or remark.
 
Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, and
Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their
eldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which means
there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of
extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age, admire his beauty,
and ask him questions which his mother answered for him, while he hung
about her and held down his head, to the great surprise of her
ladyship, who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he could
make noise enough at home.  On every formal visit a child ought to be
of the party, by way of provision for discourse.  In the present case
it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his
father or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for of
course every body differed, and every body was astonished at the
opinion of the others.
 
An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on the
rest of the children, as Sir John would not leave the house without
securing their promise of dining at the park the next day.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 7
 
 
Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage.  The ladies had
passed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened from
their view at home by the projection of a hill.  The house was large
and handsome and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality
and elegance.  The former was for Sir Johns gratification, the latter
for that of his lady.  They were scarcely ever without some friends
staying with them in the house, and they kept more company of every
kind than any other family in the neighbourhood.  It was necessary to
the happiness of both for however dissimilar in temper and outward
behaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want of
talent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with
such as society produced, within a very narrow compass.  Sir John was a
sportsman, Lady Middleton a mother.  He hunted and shot, and she
humoured her children and these were their only resources.  Lady
Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the
year round, while Sir Johns independent employments were in existence
only half the time.  Continual engagements at home and abroad, however,
supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education supported the
good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise to the good breeding of his
wife.
 
Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and of
all her domestic arrangements and from this kind of vanity was her
greatest enjoyment in any of their parties.  But Sir Johns
satisfaction in society was much more real he delighted in collecting
about him more young people than his house would hold, and the noisier
they were the better was he pleased.  He was a blessing to all the
juvenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever
forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter
his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not
suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.
 
The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy
to him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants
he had now procured for his cottage at Barton.  The Miss Dashwoods were
young, pretty, and unaffected.  It was enough to secure his good
opinion for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to
make her mind as captivating as her person.  The friendliness of his
disposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation
might be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate.  In
showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction
of a good heart and in settling a family of females only in his
cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman for a sportsman,
though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is
not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a
residence within his own manor.
 
Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by
Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity
and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young
ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day
before, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them.  They
would see, he said, only one gentleman there besides himself a
particular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither very
young nor very gay.  He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of
the party, and could assure them it should never happen so again.  He
had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some
addition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was full
of engagements.  Luckily Lady Middletons mother had arrived at Barton
within the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman,
he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might
imagine.  The young ladies, as well as their mother, were perfectly
satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and wished for
no more.
 
Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middletons mother, was a goodhumoured, merry,
fat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, and
rather vulgar.  She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinner
was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and
husbands hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex,
and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not.  Marianne was
vexed at it for her sisters sake, and turned her eyes towards Elinor
to see how she bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gave
Elinor far more pain than could arise from such commonplace raillery
as Mrs. Jenningss.
 
Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted by
resemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to be
his wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middletons mother.  He was
silent and grave.  His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite
of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old
bachelor, for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty but though
his face was not handsome, his countenance was sensible, and his
address was particularly gentlemanlike.
 
There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as
companions to the Dashwoods but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton
was so particularly repulsive, that in comparison of it the gravity of
Colonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his
motherinlaw was interesting.  Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to
enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner,
who pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an end to every kind of
discourse except what related to themselves.
 
In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she was
invited to play.  The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared to
be charmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request went
through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into
the family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since in
the same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had celebrated
that event by giving up music, although by her mothers account, she
had played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.
 
Mariannes performance was highly applauded.  Sir John was loud in his
admiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversation
with the others while every song lasted.  Lady Middleton frequently
called him to order, wondered how any ones attention could be diverted
from music for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular song
which Marianne had just finished.  Colonel Brandon alone, of all the
party, heard her without being in raptures.  He paid her only the
compliment of attention and she felt a respect for him on the
occasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless
want of taste.  His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that
ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own, was
estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the
others and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and
thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every
exquisite power of enjoyment.  She was perfectly disposed to make every
allowance for the colonels advanced state of life which humanity
required.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 8
 
 
Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure.  She had only two
daughters, both of whom she had lived to see respectably married, and
she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the
world.  In the promotion of this object she was zealously active, as
far as her ability reached and missed no opportunity of projecting
weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance.  She was
remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the
advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by
insinuations of her power over such a young man and this kind of
discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to
pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne
Dashwood.  She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first evening
of their being together, from his listening so attentively while she
sang to them and when the visit was returned by the Middletons dining
at the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again.
It must be so.  She was perfectly convinced of it.  It would be an
excellent match, for HE was rich, and SHE was handsome.  Mrs. Jennings
had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever since her
connection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge and she
was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl.
 
The immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable, for
it supplied her with endless jokes against them both.  At the park she
laughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne.  To the former
her raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,
perfectly indifferent but to the latter it was at first
incomprehensible and when its object was understood, she hardly knew
whether most to laugh at its absurdity, or censure its impertinence,
for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonels
advanced years, and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor.
 
Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger than
herself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of
her daughter, ventured to clear Mrs. Jennings from the probability of
wishing to throw ridicule on his age.
 
"But at least, Mama, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation,
though you may not think it intentionally illnatured.  Colonel Brandon
is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be MY
father and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, must have
long outlived every sensation of the kind.  It is too ridiculous!  When
is a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will not
protect him?"
 
"Infirmity!" said Elinor, "do you call Colonel Brandon infirm?  I can
easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my
mother but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of
his limbs!"
 
"Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism?  and is not that the
commonest infirmity of declining life?"
 
"My dearest child," said her mother, laughing, "at this rate you must
be in continual terror of MY decay and it must seem to you a miracle
that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty."
 
"Mama, you are not doing me justice.  I know very well that Colonel
Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of
losing him in the course of nature.  He may live twenty years longer.
But thirtyfive has nothing to do with matrimony."
 
"Perhaps," said Elinor, "thirtyfive and seventeen had better not have
any thing to do with matrimony together.  But if there should by any
chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I should
not think Colonel Brandons being thirtyfive any objection to his
marrying HER."
 
"A woman of seven and twenty," said Marianne, after pausing a moment,
"can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be
uncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might bring
herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the
provision and security of a wife.  In his marrying such a woman
therefore there would be nothing unsuitable.  It would be a compact of
convenience, and the world would be satisfied.  In my eyes it would be
no marriage at all, but that would be nothing.  To me it would seem
only a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at the
expense of the other."
 
"It would be impossible, I know," replied Elinor, "to convince you that
a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirtyfive
anything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to her.
But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the
constant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he chanced to
complain yesterday a very cold damp day of a slight rheumatic feel in
one of his shoulders."
 
"But he talked of flannel waistcoats," said Marianne "and with me a
flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps,
rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and
the feeble."
 
"Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised him
half so much.  Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting to
you in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?"
 
Soon after this, upon Elinors leaving the room, "Mama," said
Marianne, "I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannot
conceal from you.  I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well.  We have now
been here almost a fortnight, and yet he does not come.  Nothing but
real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay.  What else
can detain him at Norland?"
 
"Had you any idea of his coming so soon?" said Mrs. Dashwood.  "I had
none.  On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on the
subject, it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of
pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of his
coming to Barton.  Does Elinor expect him already?"
 
"I have never mentioned it to her, but of course she must."
 
"I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to her
yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber, she observed
that there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely that the
room would be wanted for some time."
 
"How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it!  But the whole of
their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, how
composed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation the
last evening of their being together! In Edwards farewell there was no
distinction between Elinor and me it was the good wishes of an
affectionate brother to both.  Twice did I leave them purposely
together in the course of the last morning, and each time did he most
unaccountably follow me out of the room.  And Elinor, in quitting
Norland and Edward, cried not as I did.  Even now her selfcommand is
invariable.  When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try to
avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?"
 
 
 
CHAPTER 9
 
 
The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to
themselves.  The house and the garden, with all the objects surrounding
them, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which had
given to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater
enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss of their
father.  Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for the first
fortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at
home, could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.
 
Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many for, in
spite of Sir Johns urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the
neighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at
their service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwoods spirit overcame the
wish of society for her children and she was resolute in declining to
visit any family beyond the distance of a walk.  There were but few who
could be so classed and it was not all of them that were attainable.
About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow winding
valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerly
described, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered an
ancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a little
of Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to be
better acquainted with it.  But they learnt, on enquiry, that its
possessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunately
too infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.
 
The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks.  The high
downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to
seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happy
alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior
beauties and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one
memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the partial sunshine
of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the confinement which the
settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned.  The weather was
not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their
book, in spite of Mariannes declaration that the day would be
lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off
from their hills and the two girls set off together.
 
They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at
every glimpse of blue sky and when they caught in their faces the
animating gales of a high southwesterly wind, they pitied the fears
which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such
delightful sensations.
 
"Is there a felicity in the world," said Marianne, "superior to
this?Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours."
 
Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resisting
it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenly
the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full in
their face. Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though
unwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own
house.  One consolation however remained for them, to which the
exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety it was that of
running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which
led immediately to their garden gate.
 
They set off.  Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false step
brought her suddenly to the ground and Margaret, unable to stop
herself to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached the
bottom in safety.
 
A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, was
passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when her
accident happened.  He put down his gun and ran to her assistance.  She
had raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted in
her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand.  The gentleman offered
his services and perceiving that her modesty declined what her
situation rendered necessary, took her up in his arms without farther
delay, and carried her down the hill.  Then passing through the garden,
the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directly
into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his
hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour.
 
Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and while
the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret
admiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized for
his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and so
graceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome, received
additional charms from his voice and expression.  Had he been even old,
ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would
have been secured by any act of attention to her child but the
influence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to the
action which came home to her feelings.
 
She thanked him again and again and, with a sweetness of address which
always attended her, invited him to be seated.  But this he declined,
as he was dirty and wet.  Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she
was obliged.  His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present
home was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would allow him the
honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood.  The honour
was readily granted, and he then departed, to make himself still more
interesting, in the midst of a heavy rain.
 
His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the
theme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raised
against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior
attractions. Marianne herself had seen less of his Mama the
rest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his lifting
her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their
entering the house.  But she had seen enough of him to join in all the
admiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned her
praise.  His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn
for the hero of a favourite story and in his carrying her into the
house with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of
thought which particularly recommended the action to her.  Every
circumstance belonging to him was interesting.  His name was good, his
residence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that
of all manly dresses a shootingjacket was the most becoming.  Her
imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of a
sprained ankle was disregarded.
 
Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather
that morning allowed him to get out of doors and Mariannes accident
being related to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew any
gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.
 
"Willoughby!" cried Sir John "what, is HE in the country? That is good
news however I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on
Thursday."
 
"You know him then," said Mrs. Dashwood.
 
"Know him! to be sure I do.  Why, he is down here every year."
 
"And what sort of a young man is he?"
 
"As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you.  A very decent
shot, and there is not a bolder rider in England."
 
"And is that all you can say for him?" cried Marianne, indignantly.
"But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance? What his
pursuits, his talents, and genius?"
 
Sir John was rather puzzled.
 
"Upon my soul," said he, "I do not know much about him as to all THAT.
But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the nicest
little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw.  Was she out with him
today?"
 
But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr.
Willoughbys pointer, than he could describe to her the shades of his
mind.
 
"But who is he?" said Elinor.  "Where does he come from?  Has he a
house at Allenham?"
 
On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence and he
told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the
country that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady
at Allenham Court, to whom he was related, and whose possessions he was
to inherit adding, "Yes, yes, he is very well worth catching I can
tell you, Miss Dashwood he has a pretty little estate of his own in
Somersetshire besides and if I were you, I would not give him up to my
younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills.  Miss
Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.  Brandon will
be jealous, if she does not take care."
 
"I do not believe," said Mrs. Dashwood, with a good humoured smile,
"that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY
daughters towards what you call CATCHING him.  It is not an employment
to which they have been brought up.  Men are very safe with us, let
them be ever so rich.  I am glad to find, however, from what you say,
that he is a respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance will not
be ineligible."
 
"He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived," repeated
Sir John.  "I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he
danced from eight oclock till four, without once sitting down."
 
"Did he indeed?" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes, "and with
elegance, with spirit?"
 
"Yes and he was up again at eight to ride to covert."
 
"That is what I like that is what a young man ought to be.  Whatever
be his pursuits, his eagerness in them should know no moderation, and
leave him no sense of fatigue."
 
"Aye, aye, I see how it will be," said Sir John, "I see how it will be.
You will be setting your cap at him now, and never think of poor
Brandon."
 
"That is an expression, Sir John," said Marianne, warmly, "which I
particularly dislike.  I abhor every commonplace phrase by which wit
is intended and setting ones cap at a man, or making a conquest,
are the most odious of all.  Their tendency is gross and illiberal and
if their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long ago
destroyed all its ingenuity."
 
Sir John did not much understand this reproof but he laughed as
heartily as if he did, and then replied,
 
"Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other.
Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already, and he is very well worth
setting your cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumbling
about and spraining of ankles."
 
 
 
CHAPTER 10
 
 
Mariannes preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision,
styled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to make
his personal enquiries.  He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more
than politeness with a kindness which Sir Johns account of him and
her own gratitude prompted and every thing that passed during the
visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection,
and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced
him.  Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview
to be convinced.
 
Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and a
remarkably pretty figure.  Marianne was still handsomer.  Her form,
though not so correct as her sisters, in having the advantage of
height, was more striking and her face was so lovely, that when in the
common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, truth was less
violently outraged than usually happens.  Her skin was very brown, but,
from its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant her
features were all good her smile was sweet and attractive and in her
eyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an eagerness,
which could hardily be seen without delight.  From Willoughby their
expression was at first held back, by the embarrassment which the
remembrance of his assistance created.  But when this passed away, when
her spirits became collected, when she saw that to the perfect
goodbreeding of the gentleman, he united frankness and vivacity, and
above all, when she heard him declare, that of music and dancing he was
passionately fond, she gave him such a look of approbation as secured
the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay.
 
It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her
to talk.  She could not be silent when such points were introduced, and
she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.  They speedily
discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, and
that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related
to either.  Encouraged by this to a further examination of his
opinions, she proceeded to question him on the subject of books her
favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous
a delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have been
insensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the excellence
of such works, however disregarded before.  Their taste was strikingly
alike.  The same books, the same passages were idolized by eachor if
any difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no longer than
till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be
displayed.  He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her
enthusiasm and long before his visit concluded, they conversed with
the familiarity of a longestablished acquaintance.
 
"Well, Marianne," said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, "for ONE
morning I think you have done pretty well.  You have already
ascertained Mr. Willoughbys opinion in almost every matter of
importance.  You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott you are
certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you have
received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.
But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such
extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?  You will soon
have exhausted each favourite topic.  Another meeting will suffice to
explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and
then you can have nothing farther to ask."
 
"Elinor," cried Marianne, "is this fair? is this just? are my ideas so
scanty?  But I see what you mean.  I have been too much at my ease, too
happy, too frank.  I have erred against every commonplace notion of
decorum I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been
reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitfulhad I talked only of the
weather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this
reproach would have been spared."
 
"My love," said her mother, "you must not be offended with Elinorshe
was only in jest.  I should scold her myself, if she were capable of
wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new
friend." Marianne was softened in a moment.
 
Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure in their
acquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer.  He
came to them every day.  To enquire after Marianne was at first his
excuse but the encouragement of his reception, to which every day gave
greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased
to be possible, by Mariannes perfect recovery.  She was confined for
some days to the house but never had any confinement been less
irksome.  Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick
imagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners.  He was
exactly formed to engage Mariannes heart, for with all this, he joined
not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which was
now roused and increased by the example of her own, and which
recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else.
 
His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment.  They read,
they talked, they sang together his musical talents were considerable
and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward had
unfortunately wanted.
 
In Mrs. Dashwoods estimation he was as faultless as in Mariannes and
Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which he
strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying too
much what he thought on every occasion, without attention to persons or
circumstances.  In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other
people, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided
attention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too easily the
forms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution which Elinor
could not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in
its support.
 
Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized
her at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her
ideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable.  Willoughby was
all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every
brighter period, as capable of attaching her and his behaviour
declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilities
were strong.
 
Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of their
marriage had been raised, by his prospect of riches, was led before the
end of a week to hope and expect it and secretly to congratulate
herself on having gained two such sonsinlaw as Edward and Willoughby.
 
Colonel Brandons partiality for Marianne, which had so early been
discovered by his friends, now first became perceptible to Elinor, when
it ceased to be noticed by them.  Their attention and wit were drawn
off to his more fortunate rival and the raillery which the other had
incurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his feelings
began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility.
Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments
which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction, were now
actually excited by her sister and that however a general resemblance
of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr.
Willoughby, an equally striking opposition of character was no
hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon.  She saw it with concern
for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to a
very lively one of five and twenty? and as she could not even wish him
successful, she heartily wished him indifferent.  She liked himin
spite of his gravity and reserve, she beheld in him an object of
interest.  His manners, though serious, were mild and his reserve
appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any
natural gloominess of temper.  Sir John had dropped hints of past
injuries and disappointments, which justified her belief of his being
an unfortunate man, and she regarded him with respect and compassion.
 
Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by
Willoughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being neither
lively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.
 
"Brandon is just the kind of man," said Willoughby one day, when they
were talking of him together, "whom every body speaks well of, and
nobody cares about whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers
to talk to."
 
"That is exactly what I think of him," cried Marianne.
 
"Do not boast of it, however," said Elinor, "for it is injustice in
both of you.  He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and
I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him."
 
"That he is patronised by YOU," replied Willoughby, "is certainly in
his favour but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach in
itself.  Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a
woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command the
indifference of any body else?"
 
"But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will
make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother.  If their
praise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not more
undiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust."
 
"In defence of your protege you can even be saucy."
 
"My protege, as you call him, is a sensible man and sense will always
have attractions for me.  Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty
and forty.  He has seen a great deal of the world has been abroad, has
read, and has a thinking mind.  I have found him capable of giving me
much information on various subjects and he has always answered my
inquiries with readiness of goodbreeding and good nature."
 
"That is to say," cried Marianne contemptuously, "he has told you, that
in the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are
troublesome."
 
"He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such inquiries,
but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed."
 
"Perhaps," said Willoughby, "his observations may have extended to the
existence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins."
 
"I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much further
than your candour.  But why should you dislike him?"
 
"I do not dislike him.  I consider him, on the contrary, as a very
respectable man, who has every bodys good word, and nobodys notice
who, has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how to
employ, and two new coats every year."
 
"Add to which," cried Marianne, "that he has neither genius, taste, nor
spirit.  That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings no
ardour, and his voice no expression."
 
"You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass," replied Elinor,
"and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the
commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and
insipid.  I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man, wellbred,
wellinformed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable
heart."
 
"Miss Dashwood," cried Willoughby, "you are now using me unkindly.  You
are endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against my
will.  But it will not do.  You shall find me as stubborn as you can be
artful.  I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel
Brandon he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine he has
found fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade him
to buy my brown mare.  If it will be any satisfaction to you, however,
to be told, that I believe his character to be in other respects
irreproachable, I am ready to confess it.  And in return for an
acknowledgment, which must give me some pain, you cannot deny me the
privilege of disliking him as much as ever."
 
 
 
CHAPTER 11
 
 
Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came
into Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy their
time as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have such
frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little
leisure for serious employment.  Yet such was the case.  When Marianne
was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad, which Sir
John had been previously forming, were put into execution.  The private
balls at the park then began and parties on the water were made and
accomplished as often as a showery October would allow.  In every
meeting of the kind Willoughby was included and the ease and
familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly
calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the
Dashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of
Marianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,
in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her
affection.
 
Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment.  She only wished
that it were less openly shewn and once or twice did venture to
suggest the propriety of some selfcommand to Marianne.  But Marianne
abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve
and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves
illaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort, but a
disgraceful subjection of reason to commonplace and mistaken notions.
Willoughby thought the same and their behaviour at all times, was an
illustration of their opinions.
 
When he was present she had no eyes for any one else.  Every thing he
did, was right.  Every thing he said, was clever.  If their evenings at
the park were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the rest
of the party to get her a good hand.  If dancing formed the amusement
of the night, they were partners for half the time and when obliged to
separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand together and
scarcely spoke a word to any body else.  Such conduct made them of
course most exceedingly laughed at but ridicule could not shame, and
seemed hardly to provoke them.
 
Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left
her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them.  To her
it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and
ardent mind.
 
This was the season of happiness to Marianne.  Her heart was devoted to
Willoughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she brought with
her from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she had thought it
possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed on her
present home.
 
Elinors happiness was not so great.  Her heart was not so much at
ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure.  They afforded
her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind,
nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than
ever.  Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the
conversation she missed although the latter was an everlasting talker,
and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a
large share of her discourse.  She had already repeated her own history
to Elinor three or four times and had Elinors memory been equal to
her means of improvement, she might have known very early in their
acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jenningss last illness, and
what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died.  Lady Middleton
was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent.  Elinor
needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere
calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do.  Towards her
husband and mother she was the same as to them and intimacy was
therefore neither to be looked for nor desired.  She had nothing to say
one day that she had not said the day before.  Her insipidity was
invariable, for even her spirits were always the same and though she
did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband, provided every
thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her,
she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might
have experienced in sitting at homeand so little did her presence
add to the pleasure of the others, by any share in their conversation,
that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her
solicitude about her troublesome boys.
 
In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor find
a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities, excite
the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion.
Willoughby was out of the question.  Her admiration and regard, even
her sisterly regard, was all his own but he was a lover his
attentions were wholly Mariannes, and a far less agreeable man might
have been more generally pleasing.  Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for
himself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in
conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the
indifference of her sister.
 
Elinors compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect
that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him.
This suspicion was given by some words which accidently dropped from
him one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together by
mutual consent, while the others were dancing.  His eyes were fixed on
Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faint
smile, "Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second
attachments."
 
"No," replied Elinor, "her opinions are all romantic."
 
"Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist."
 
"I believe she does.  But how she contrives it without reflecting on
the character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know not.
A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of
common sense and observation and then they may be more easy to define
and to justify than they now are, by any body but herself."
 
"This will probably be the case," he replied "and yet there is
something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is
sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions."
 
"I cannot agree with you there," said Elinor.  "There are
inconveniences attending such feelings as Mariannes, which all the
charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for.  Her
systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at
nought and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward
to as her greatest possible advantage."
 
After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying,
 
"Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a
second attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body?  Are those
who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the
inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be
equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?"
 
"Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles.
I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second
attachments being pardonable."
 
"This," said he, "cannot hold but a change, a total change of
sentimentsNo, no, do not desire it for when the romantic refinements
of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are they
succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous!  I
speak from experience.  I once knew a lady who in temper and mind
greatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like her, but who
from an inforced changefrom a series of unfortunate circumstances"
Here he stopt suddenly appeared to think that he had said too much,
and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures, which might not
otherwise have entered Elinors head.  The lady would probably have
passed without suspicion, had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what
concerned her ought not to escape his lips.  As it was, it required but
a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender
recollection of past regard.  Elinor attempted no more.  But Marianne,
in her place, would not have done so little.  The whole story would
have been speedily formed under her active imagination and every thing
established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 12
 
 
As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the
latter communicated a piece of news to her sister, which in spite of
all that she knew before of Mariannes imprudence and want of thought,
surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both.  Marianne told her,
with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, one
that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was
exactly calculated to carry a woman.  Without considering that it was
not in her mothers plan to keep any horse, that if she were to alter
her resolution in favour of this gift, she must buy another for the
servant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable
to receive them, she had accepted the present without hesitation, and
told her sister of it in raptures.
 
"He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it,"
she added, "and when it arrives we will ride every day.  You shall
share its use with me.  Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the
delight of a gallop on some of these downs."
 
Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to
comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair and for
some time she refused to submit to them.  As to an additional servant,
the expense would be a trifle Mama she was sure would never object to
it and any horse would do for HIM he might always get one at the
park as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient.  Elinor then
ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a
man so little, or at least so lately known to her.  This was too much.
 
"You are mistaken, Elinor," said she warmly, "in supposing I know very
little of Willoughby.  I have not known him long indeed, but I am much
better acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature in the
world, except yourself and mama.  It is not time or opportunity that is
to determine intimacyit is disposition alone.  Seven years would be
insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven
days are more than enough for others.  I should hold myself guilty of
greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from
Willoughby.  Of John I know very little, though we have lived together
for years but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed."
 
Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more.  She knew her
sisters temper.  Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach
her the more to her own opinion.  But by an appeal to her affection for
her mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent
mother must draw on herself, if as would probably be the case she
consented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly
subdued and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent
kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw
him next, that it must be declined.
 
She was faithful to her word and when Willoughby called at the
cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to
him in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his
present.  The reasons for this alteration were at the same time
related, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side
impossible.  His concern however was very apparent and after
expressing it with earnestness, he added, in the same low voice,"But,
Marianne, the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now.  I
shall keep it only till you can claim it.  When you leave Barton to
form your own establishment in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shall
receive you."
 
This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood and in the whole of the
sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it, and in his addressing her
sister by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy so
decided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between
them.  From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each
other and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she, or
any of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to discover
it by accident.
 
Margaret related something to her the next day, which placed this
matter in a still clearer light.  Willoughby had spent the preceding
evening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour
with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity for observations,
which, with a most important face, she communicated to her eldest
sister, when they were next by themselves.
 
"Oh, Elinor!" she cried, "I have such a secret to tell you about
Marianne.  I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon."
 
"You have said so," replied Elinor, "almost every day since they first
met on Highchurch Down and they had not known each other a week, I
believe, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round
her neck but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great
uncle."
 
"But indeed this is quite another thing.  I am sure they will be
married very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair."
 
"Take care, Margaret.  It may be only the hair of some great uncle of
HIS."
 
"But, indeed, Elinor, it is Mariannes. I am almost sure it is, for I
saw him cut it off.  Last night after tea, when you and mama went out
of the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as could
be, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently he took
up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it was all
tumbled down her back and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of
white paper and put it into his pocketbook."
 
For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could not
withhold her credit nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstance
was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself.
 
Margarets sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory
to her sister.  When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the
park, to give the name of the young man who was Elinors particular
favourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,
Margaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying, "I must not
tell, may I, Elinor?"
 
This of course made every body laugh and Elinor tried to laugh too.
But the effort was painful.  She was convinced that Margaret had fixed
on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a
standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.
 
Marianne felt for her most sincerely but she did more harm than good
to the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to
Margaret,
 
"Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right to
repeat them."
 
"I never had any conjectures about it," replied Margaret "it was you
who told me of it yourself."
 
This increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerly
pressed to say something more.
 
"Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it," said Mrs.
Jennings.  "What is the gentlemans name?"
 
"I must not tell, maam. But I know very well what it is and I know
where he is too."
 
"Yes, yes, we can guess where he is at his own house at Norland to be
sure.  He is the curate of the parish I dare say."
 
"No, THAT he is not.  He is of no profession at all."
 
"Margaret," said Marianne with great warmth, "you know that all this is
an invention of your own, and that there is no such person in
existence."
 
"Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was such
a man once, and his name begins with an F."
 
Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at this
moment, "that it rained very hard," though she believed the
interruption to proceed less from any attention to her, than from her
ladyships great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as
delighted her husband and mother.  The idea however started by her, was
immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasion
mindful of the feelings of others and much was said on the subject of
rain by both of them.  Willoughby opened the pianoforte, and asked
Marianne to sit down to it and thus amidst the various endeavours of
different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground.  But not so
easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her.
 
A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a
very fine place about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to a
brotherinlaw of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could not
be seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict orders
on that head.  The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful, and
Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be allowed
to be a tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit them, at
least, twice every summer for the last ten years.  They contained a
noble piece of water a sail on which was to a form a great part of the
mornings amusement cold provisions were to be taken, open carriages
only to be employed, and every thing conducted in the usual style of a
complete party of pleasure.
 
To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking,
considering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for the
last fortnightand Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was
persuaded by Elinor to stay at home.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 13
 
 
Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from
what Elinor had expected.  She was prepared to be wet through,
fatigued, and frightened but the event was still more unfortunate, for
they did not go at all.
 
By ten oclock the whole party was assembled at the park, where they
were to breakfast.  The morning was rather favourable, though it had
rained all night, as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,
and the sun frequently appeared.  They were all in high spirits and
good humour, eager to be happy, and determined to submit to the
greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise.
 
While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in.  Among the
rest there was one for Colonel Brandonhe took it, looked at the
direction, changed colour, and immediately left the room.
 
"What is the matter with Brandon?" said Sir John.
 
Nobody could tell.
 
"I hope he has had no bad news," said Lady Middleton.  "It must be
something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my
breakfast table so suddenly."
 
In about five minutes he returned.
 
"No bad news, Colonel, I hope" said Mrs. Jennings, as soon as he
entered the room.
 
"None at all, maam, I thank you."
 
"Was it from Avignon?  I hope it is not to say that your sister is
worse."
 
"No, maam. It came from town, and is merely a letter of business."
 
"But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a
letter of business?  Come, come, this wont do, Colonel so let us hear
the truth of it."
 
"My dear madam," said Lady Middleton, "recollect what you are saying."
 
"Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married?" said
Mrs. Jennings, without attending to her daughters reproof.
 
"No, indeed, it is not."
 
"Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel.  And I hope she is well."
 
"Whom do you mean, maam?" said he, colouring a little.
 
"Oh! you know who I mean."
 
"I am particularly sorry, maam," said he, addressing Lady Middleton,
"that I should receive this letter today, for it is on business which
requires my immediate attendance in town."
 
"In town!" cried Mrs. Jennings.  "What can you have to do in town at
this time of year?"
 
"My own loss is great," he continued, "in being obliged to leave so
agreeable a party but I am the more concerned, as I fear my presence
is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell."
 
What a blow upon them all was this!
 
"But if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon," said
Marianne, eagerly, "will it not be sufficient?"
 
He shook his head.
 
"We must go," said Sir John."It shall not be put off when we are so
near it.  You cannot go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all."
 
"I wish it could be so easily settled.  But it is not in my power to
delay my journey for one day!"
 
"If you would but let us know what your business is," said Mrs.
Jennings, "we might see whether it could be put off or not."
 
"You would not be six hours later," said Willoughby, "if you were to
defer your journey till our return."
 
"I cannot afford to lose ONE hour."
 
Elinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne, "There
are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure.  Brandon is one of
them.  He was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented this
trick for getting out of it.  I would lay fifty guineas the letter was
of his own writing."
 
"I have no doubt of it," replied Marianne.
 
"There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know of
old," said Sir John, "when once you are determined on anything.  But,
however, I hope you will think better of it.  Consider, here are the
two Miss Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods walked
up from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his
usual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell."
 
Colonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of
disappointing the party but at the same time declared it to be
unavoidable.
 
"Well, then, when will you come back again?"
 
"I hope we shall see you at Barton," added her ladyship, "as soon as
you can conveniently leave town and we must put off the party to
Whitwell till you return."
 
"You are very obliging.  But it is so uncertain, when I may have it in
my power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all."
 
"Oh! he must and shall come back," cried Sir John.  "If he is not here
by the end of the week, I shall go after him."
 
"Ay, so do, Sir John," cried Mrs. Jennings, "and then perhaps you may
find out what his business is."
 
"I do not want to pry into other mens concerns.  I suppose it is
something he is ashamed of."
 
Colonel Brandons horses were announced.
 
"You do not go to town on horseback, do you?" added Sir John.
 
"No. Only to Honiton.  I shall then go post."
 
"Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you a good journey.  But you
had better change your mind."
 
"I assure you it is not in my power."
 
He then took leave of the whole party.
 
"Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this
winter, Miss Dashwood?"
 
"I am afraid, none at all."
 
"Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to
do."
 
To Marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing.
 
"Come Colonel," said Mrs. Jennings, "before you go, do let us know what
you are going about."
 
He wished her a good morning, and, attended by Sir John, left the room.
 
The complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto
restrained, now burst forth universally and they all agreed again and
again how provoking it was to be so disappointed.
 
"I can guess what his business is, however," said Mrs. Jennings
exultingly.
 
"Can you, maam?" said almost every body.
 
"Yes it is about Miss Williams, I am sure."
 
"And who is Miss Williams?" asked Marianne.
 
"What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must have
heard of her before.  She is a relation of the Colonels, my dear a
very near relation.  We will not say how near, for fear of shocking the
young ladies." Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,
"She is his natural daughter."
 
"Indeed!"
 
"Oh, yes and as like him as she can stare.  I dare say the Colonel
will leave her all his fortune."
 
When Sir John returned, he joined most heartily in the general regret
on so unfortunate an event concluding however by observing, that as
they were all got together, they must do something by way of being
happy and after some consultation it was agreed, that although
happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure a
tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country.  The
carriages were then ordered Willoughbys was first, and Marianne never
looked happier than when she got into it.  He drove through the park
very fast, and they were soon out of sight and nothing more of them
was seen till their return, which did not happen till after the return
of all the rest.  They both seemed delighted with their drive but said
only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes, while the others
went on the downs.
 
It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening, and that
every body should be extremely merry all day long.  Some more of the
Careys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly
twenty to table, which Sir John observed with great contentment.
Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.
Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinors right hand and they had not been long
seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and said to
Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear, "I have found you out in
spite of all your tricks.  I know where you spent the morning."
 
Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily, "Where, pray?"
 
"Did not you know," said Willoughby, "that we had been out in my
curricle?"
 
"Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determined
to find out WHERE you had been to. I hope you like your house, Miss
Marianne.  It is a very large one, I know and when I come to see you,
I hope you will have newfurnished it, for it wanted it very much when
I was there six years ago."
 
Marianne turned away in great confusion.  Mrs. Jennings laughed
heartily and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they
had been, she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr.
Willoughbys groom and that she had by that method been informed that
they had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there in
walking about the garden and going all over the house.
 
Elinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very unlikely
that Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter the house
while Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest
acquaintance.
 
As soon as they left the diningroom, Elinor enquired of her about it
and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance
related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true.  Marianne was quite angry
with her for doubting it.
 
"Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we
did not see the house?  Is not it what you have often wished to do
yourself?"
 
"Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and with
no other companion than Mr. Willoughby."
 
"Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew
that house and as he went in an open carriage, it was impossible to
have any other companion.  I never spent a pleasanter morning in my
life."
 
"I am afraid," replied Elinor, "that the pleasantness of an employment
does not always evince its propriety."
 
"On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor for if
there had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have been
sensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are acting
wrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure."
 
"But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some very
impertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of
your own conduct?"
 
"If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of
impropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our lives.
I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation.  I
am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs.
Smiths grounds, or in seeing her house.  They will one day be Mr.
Willoughbys, and"
 
"If they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not be
justified in what you have done."
 
She blushed at this hint but it was even visibly gratifying to her
and after a ten minutes interval of earnest thought, she came to her
sister again, and said with great good humour, "Perhaps, Elinor, it WAS
rather illjudged in me to go to Allenham but Mr. Willoughby wanted
particularly to shew me the place and it is a charming house, I assure
you.There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs of a nice
comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it would
be delightful.  It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.  On
one side you look across the bowlinggreen, behind the house, to a
beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view of the church
and village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have so
often admired.  I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be
more forlorn than the furniture,but if it were newly fitted upa
couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of the
pleasantest summerrooms in England."
 
Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others,
she would have described every room in the house with equal delight.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 14
 
 
The sudden termination of Colonel Brandons visit at the park, with his
steadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised the
wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days she was a great
wonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all
the comings and goings of all their acquaintance.  She wondered, with
little intermission what could be the reason of it was sure there must
be some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that could
have befallen him, with a fixed determination that he should not escape
them all.
 
"Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure," said she.
"I could see it in his face.  Poor man!  I am afraid his circumstances
may be bad.  The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two
thousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved.  I do
think he must have been sent for about money matters, for what else can
it be?  I wonder whether it is so.  I would give anything to know the
truth of it.  Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare
say it is, because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.  May be
she is ill in town nothing in the world more likely, for I have a
notion she is always rather sickly.  I would lay any wager it is about
Miss Williams.  It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his
circumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man, and to be sure must
have cleared the estate by this time.  I wonder what it can be!  May be
his sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him over.  His setting
off in such a hurry seems very like it.  Well, I wish him out of all
his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the bargain."
 
So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.  Her opinion varying with every
fresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose.
Elinor, though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel
Brandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away,
which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling for besides that the
circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or
variety of speculation, her wonder was otherwise disposed of.  It was
engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby on
the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them
all.  As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strange
and more incompatible with the disposition of both.  Why they should
not openly acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant
behaviour to each other declared to have taken place, Elinor could not
imagine.
 
She could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in
their power for though Willoughby was independent, there was no reason
to believe him rich.  His estate had been rated by Sir John at about
six or seven hundred a year but he lived at an expense to which that
income could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained of
his poverty.  But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them
relative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at all,
she could not account and it was so wholly contradictory to their
general opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered her mind
of their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent her
making any inquiry of Marianne.
 
Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, than
Willoughbys behaviour.  To Marianne it had all the distinguishing
tenderness which a lovers heart could give, and to the rest of the
family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother.  The
cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home many more
of his hours were spent there than at Allenham and if no general
engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him
out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest
of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his
favourite pointer at her feet.
 
One evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the
country, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of
attachment to the objects around him and on Mrs. Dashwoods happening
to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he warmly
opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as
perfect with him.
 
"What!" he exclaimed"Improve this dear cottage!  No. THAT I will
never consent to.  Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inch
to its size, if my feelings are regarded."
 
"Do not be alarmed," said Miss Dashwood, "nothing of the kind will be
done for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it."
 
"I am heartily glad of it," he cried.  "May she always be poor, if she
can employ her riches no better."
 
"Thank you, Willoughby.  But you may be assured that I would not
sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one
whom I loved, for all the improvements in the world.  Depend upon it
that whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in
the spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it
in a manner so painful to you.  But are you really so attached to this
place as to see no defect in it?"
 
"I am," said he.  "To me it is faultless.  Nay, more, I consider it as
the only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were I
rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again in
the exact plan of this cottage."
 
"With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose," said
Elinor.
 
"Yes," cried he in the same eager tone, "with all and every thing
belonging to itin no one convenience or INconvenience about it,
should the least variation be perceptible.  Then, and then only, under
such a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at
Barton."
 
"I flatter myself," replied Elinor, "that even under the disadvantage
of better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your
own house as faultless as you now do this."
 
"There certainly are circumstances," said Willoughby, "which might
greatly endear it to me but this place will always have one claim of
my affection, which no other can possibly share."
 
Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes were
fixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well she
understood him.
 
"How often did I wish," added he, "when I was at Allenham this time
twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited!  I never passed within
view of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no one
should live in it.  How little did I then think that the very first
news I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country,
would be that Barton cottage was taken and I felt an immediate
satisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of
prescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can account
for.  Must it not have been so, Marianne?" speaking to her in a lowered
voice.  Then continuing his former tone, he said, "And yet this house
you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?  You would rob it of its simplicity by
imaginary improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance
first began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by
us together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,
and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has
hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort
than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world
could possibly afford."
 
Mrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind should
be attempted.
 
"You are a good woman," he warmly replied.  "Your promise makes me
easy.  Extend it a little farther, and it will make me happy.  Tell me
that not only your house will remain the same, but that I shall ever
find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling and that you will
always consider me with the kindness which has made everything
belonging to you so dear to me."
 
The promise was readily given, and Willoughbys behaviour during the
whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness.
 
"Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?" said Mrs. Dashwood, when he was
leaving them.  "I do not ask you to come in the morning, for we must
walk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton."
 
He engaged to be with them by four oclock.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 15
 
 
Mrs. Dashwoods visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day, and
two of her daughters went with her but Marianne excused herself from
being of the party, under some trifling pretext of employment and her
mother, who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the
night before of calling on her while they were absent, was perfectly
satisfied with her remaining at home.
 
On their return from the park they found Willoughbys curricle and
servant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that
her conjecture had been just.  So far it was all as she had foreseen
but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her
to expect.  They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came
hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with her
handkerchief at her eyes and without noticing them ran up stairs.
Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had
just quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning against
the mantelpiece with his back towards them.  He turned round on their
coming in, and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the
emotion which overpowered Marianne.
 
"Is anything the matter with her?" cried Mrs. Dashwood as she
entered"is she ill?"
 
"I hope not," he replied, trying to look cheerful and with a forced
smile presently added, "It is I who may rather expect to be illfor I
am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment!"
 
"Disappointment?"
 
"Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you.  Mrs. Smith has
this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent
cousin, by sending me on business to London.  I have just received my
dispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham and by way of
exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you."
 
"To London!and are you going this morning?"
 
"Almost this moment."
 
"This is very unfortunate.  But Mrs. Smith must be obligedand her
business will not detain you from us long I hope."
 
He coloured as he replied, "You are very kind, but I have no idea of
returning into Devonshire immediately.  My visits to Mrs. Smith are
never repeated within the twelvemonth."
 
"And is Mrs. Smith your only friend?  Is Allenham the only house in the
neighbourhood to which you will be welcome?  For shame, Willoughby, can
you wait for an invitation here?"
 
His colour increased and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only
replied, "You are too good."
 
Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.  Elinor felt equal
amazement.  For a few moments every one was silent.  Mrs. Dashwood
first spoke.
 
"I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage you
will always be welcome for I will not press you to return here
immediately, because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing
to Mrs. Smith and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question
your judgment than to doubt your inclination."
 
"My engagements at present," replied Willoughby, confusedly, "are of
such a naturethatI dare not flatter myself"
 
He stopt.  Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak, and another
pause succeeded.  This was broken by Willoughby, who said with a faint
smile, "It is folly to linger in this manner.  I will not torment
myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is
impossible for me now to enjoy."
 
He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room.  They saw him
step into his carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight.
 
Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted the
parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this
sudden departure occasioned.
 
Elinors uneasiness was at least equal to her mothers.  She thought of
what had just passed with anxiety and distrust.  Willoughbys behaviour
in taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation of
cheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mothers
invitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself,
greatly disturbed her.  One moment she feared that no serious design
had ever been formed on his side and the next that some unfortunate
quarrel had taken place between him and her sisterthe distress in
which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could
most reasonably account for, though when she considered what Mariannes
love for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.
 
But whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her sisters
affliction was indubitable and she thought with the tenderest
compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability
not merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a
duty.
 
In about half an hour her mother returned, and though her eyes were
red, her countenance was not uncheerful.
 
"Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor," said she,
as she sat down to work, "and with how heavy a heart does he travel?"
 
"It is all very strange.  So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the work
of a moment.  And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so
affectionate?  And now, after only ten minutes noticeGone too without
intending to return!Something more than what he owned to us must have
happened.  He did not speak, he did not behave like himself.  YOU must
have seen the difference as well as I.  What can it be?  Can they have
quarrelled?  Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept
your invitation here?"
 
"It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor I could plainly see
THAT.  He had not the power of accepting it.  I have thought it all
over I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at
first seemed strange to me as well as to you."
 
"Can you, indeed!"
 
"Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory waybut
you, Elinor, who love to doubt where you canit will not satisfy YOU,
I know but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it.  I am
persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne, disapproves
of it, perhaps because she has other views for him, and on that
account is eager to get him awayand that the business which she
sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him.
This is what I believe to have happened.  He is, moreover, aware that
she DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at present
confess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels himself
obliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her schemes, and
absent himself from Devonshire for a while.  You will tell me, I know,
that this may or may NOT have happened but I will listen to no cavil,
unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair
as satisfactory at this.  And now, Elinor, what have you to say?"
 
"Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer."
 
"Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have happened.
Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings!  You had rather
take evil upon credit than good.  You had rather look out for misery
for Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the
latter.  You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took leave
of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn.  And is
no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by
recent disappointment?  Are no probabilities to be accepted, merely
because they are not certainties?  Is nothing due to the man whom we
have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill
of?  To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, though
unavoidably secret for a while?  And, after all, what is it you suspect
him of?"
 
"I can hardly tell myself.  But suspicion of something unpleasant is
the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed
in him.  There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of
the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to be
candid in my judgment of every body.  Willoughby may undoubtedly have
very sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.
But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at
once.  Secrecy may be advisable but still I cannot help wondering at
its being practiced by him."
 
"Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where the
deviation is necessary.  But you really do admit the justice of what I
have said in his defence?I am happyand he is acquitted."
 
"Not entirely.  It may be proper to conceal their engagement if they
ARE engaged from Mrs. Smithand if that is the case, it must be
highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at
present.  But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us."
 
"Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby and
Marianne of concealment? This is strange indeed, when your eyes have
been reproaching them every day for incautiousness."
 
"I want no proof of their affection," said Elinor "but of their
engagement I do."
 
"I am perfectly satisfied of both."
 
"Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either of
them."
 
"I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly.  Has
not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last
fortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his future
wife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation?
Have we not perfectly understood each other?  Has not my consent been
daily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionate
respect?  My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement?  How
could such a thought occur to you?  How is it to be supposed that
Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your sisters love, should leave
her, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of his
affectionthat they should part without a mutual exchange of
confidence?"
 
"I confess," replied Elinor, "that every circumstance except ONE is in
favour of their engagement but that ONE is the total silence of both
on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other."
 
"How strange this is!  You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby,
if, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt the
nature of the terms on which they are together.  Has he been acting a
part in his behaviour to your sister all this time?  Do you suppose him
really indifferent to her?"
 
"No, I cannot think that.  He must and does love her I am sure."
 
"But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with such
indifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to him."
 
"You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered this
matter as certain.  I have had my doubts, I confess but they are
fainter than they were, and they may soon be entirely done away.  If we
find they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed."
 
"A mighty concession indeed!  If you were to see them at the altar, you
would suppose they were going to be married.  Ungracious girl!  But I
require no such proof.  Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to
justify doubt no secrecy has been attempted all has been uniformly
open and unreserved.  You cannot doubt your sisters wishes.  It must
be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect.  But why?  Is he not a man of
honour and feeling? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to
create alarm? can he be deceitful?"
 
"I hope not, I believe not," cried Elinor.  "I love Willoughby,
sincerely love him and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more
painful to yourself than to me.  It has been involuntary, and I will
not encourage it.  I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his
manners this morninghe did not speak like himself, and did not
return your kindness with any cordiality.  But all this may be
explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed.  He
had just parted from my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest
affliction and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs.
Smith, to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet aware
that by declining your invitation, by saying that he was going away for
some time, he should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by
our family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed.  In such a
case, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more
to his honour I think, as well as more consistent with his general
characterbut I will not raise objections against any ones conduct
on so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself,
or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent."
 
"You speak very properly.  Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be
suspected.  Though WE have not known him long, he is no stranger in
this part of the world and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?
Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,
it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging
everything to me at once but this is not the case.  It is an
engagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriage
must be at a very uncertain distance and even secrecy, as far as it
can be observed, may now be very advisable."
 
They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret and Elinor was then
at liberty to think over the representations of her mother, to
acknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all.
 
They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time, when she entered the
room and took her place at the table without saying a word.  Her eyes
were red and swollen and it seemed as if her tears were even then
restrained with difficulty.  She avoided the looks of them all, could
neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her mothers silently
pressing her hand with tender compassion, her small degree of fortitude
was quite overcome, she burst into tears and left the room.
 
This violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening.  She
was without any power, because she was without any desire of command
over herself.  The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby
overpowered her in an instant and though her family were most
anxiously attentive to her comfort, it was impossible for them, if they
spoke at all, to keep clear of every subject which her feelings
connected with him.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 16
 
 
Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able
to sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby.  She
would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next
morning, had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than
when she lay down in it.  But the feelings which made such composure a
disgrace, left her in no danger of incurring it.  She was awake the
whole night, and she wept the greatest part of it.  She got up with a
headache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment
giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters, and forbidding all
attempt at consolation from either.  Her sensibility was potent enough!
 
When breakfast was over she walked out by herself, and wandered about
the village of Allenham, indulging the recollection of past enjoyment
and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning.
 
The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling.  She played
over every favourite song that she had been used to play to Willoughby,
every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined, and sat at
the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out
for her, till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be
gained and this nourishment of grief was every day applied.  She spent
whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying her voice
often totally suspended by her tears.  In books too, as well as in
music, she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and
present was certain of giving.  She read nothing but what they had been
used to read together.
 
Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever it
sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy but these employments,
to which she daily recurred, her solitary walks and silent meditations,
still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.
 
No letter from Willoughby came and none seemed expected by Marianne.
Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again became uneasy.  But Mrs.
Dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them, which at
least satisfied herself.
 
"Remember, Elinor," said she, "how very often Sir John fetches our
letters himself from the post, and carries them to it.  We have already
agreed that secrecy may be necessary, and we must acknowledge that it
could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through
Sir Johns hands."
 
Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried to find in it a
motive sufficient for their silence.  But there was one method so
direct, so simple, and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real
state of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery, that she
could not help suggesting it to her mother.
 
"Why do you not ask Marianne at once," said she, "whether she is or she
is not engaged to Willoughby?  From you, her mother, and so kind, so
indulgent a mother, the question could not give offence.  It would be
the natural result of your affection for her.  She used to be all
unreserve, and to you more especially."
 
"I would not ask such a question for the world.  Supposing it possible
that they are not engaged, what distress would not such an enquiry
inflict!  At any rate it would be most ungenerous.  I should never
deserve her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession of
what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one.  I know
Mariannes heart I know that she dearly loves me, and that I shall not
be the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances make
the revealment of it eligible.  I would not attempt to force the
confidence of any one of a child much less because a sense of duty
would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct."
 
Elinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her sisters
youth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain common sense, common
care, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwoods romantic
delicacy.
 
It was several days before Willoughbys name was mentioned before
Marianne by any of her family Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were
not so nice their witticisms added pain to many a painful hourbut
one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume of
Shakespeare, exclaimed,
 
"We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne our dear Willoughby went away
before we could get through it.  We will put it by, that when he comes
again...But it may be months, perhaps, before THAT happens."
 
"Months!" cried Marianne, with strong surprise.  "Nonor many weeks."
 
Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said but it gave Elinor
pleasure, as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive of
confidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions.
 
One morning, about a week after his leaving the country, Marianne was
prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead of
wandering away by herself.  Hitherto she had carefully avoided every
companion in her rambles.  If her sisters intended to walk on the
downs, she directly stole away towards the lanes if they talked of the
valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never be
found when the others set off.  But at length she was secured by the
exertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.
They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,
for Mariannes MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied with
gaining one point, would not then attempt more.  Beyond the entrance of
the valley, where the country, though still rich, was less wild and
more open, a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first
coming to Barton, lay before them and on reaching that point, they
stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect which formed the
distance of their view from the cottage, from a spot which they had
never happened to reach in any of their walks before.
 
Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered an animated one
it was a man on horseback riding towards them.  In a few minutes they
could distinguish him to be a gentleman and in a moment afterwards
Marianne rapturously exclaimed,
 
"It is he it is indeedI know it is!"and was hastening to meet
him, when Elinor cried out,
 
"Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.  It is not Willoughby.
The person is not tall enough for him, and has not his air."
 
"He has, he has," cried Marianne, "I am sure he has.  His air, his
coat, his horse.  I knew how soon he would come."
 
She walked eagerly on as she spoke and Elinor, to screen Marianne from
particularity, as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby,
quickened her pace and kept up with her.  They were soon within thirty
yards of the gentleman.  Marianne looked again her heart sunk within
her and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back, when the voices
of both her sisters were raised to detain her a third, almost as well
known as Willoughbys, joined them in begging her to stop, and she
turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars.
 
He was the only person in the world who could at that moment be
forgiven for not being Willoughby the only one who could have gained a
smile from her but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in her
sisters happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.
 
He dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant, walked back with
them to Barton, whither he was purposely coming to visit them.
 
He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially by
Marianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him than
even Elinor herself.  To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward
and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness
which she had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour.  On
Edwards side, more particularly, there was a deficiency of all that a
lover ought to look and say on such an occasion.  He was confused,
seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked neither
rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him by
questions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection.  Marianne
saw and listened with increasing surprise.  She began almost to feel a
dislike of Edward and it ended, as every feeling must end with her, by
carrying back her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a
contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.
 
After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries
of meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London.  No,
he had been in Devonshire a fortnight.
 
"A fortnight!" she repeated, surprised at his being so long in the same
county with Elinor without seeing her before.
 
He looked rather distressed as he added, that he had been staying with
some friends near Plymouth.
 
"Have you been lately in Sussex?" said Elinor.
 
"I was at Norland about a month ago."
 
"And how does dear, dear Norland look?" cried Marianne.
 
"Dear, dear Norland," said Elinor, "probably looks much as it always
does at this time of the year.  The woods and walks thickly covered
with dead leaves."
 
"Oh," cried Marianne, "with what transporting sensation have I formerly
seen them fall!  How have I delighted, as I walked, to see them driven
in showers about me by the wind!  What feelings have they, the season,
the air altogether inspired!  Now there is no one to regard them.  They
are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven as much as
possible from the sight."
 
"It is not every one," said Elinor, "who has your passion for dead
leaves."
 
"No my feelings are not often shared, not often understood.  But
SOMETIMES they are."As she said this, she sunk into a reverie for a
few momentsbut rousing herself again, "Now, Edward," said she,
calling his attention to the prospect, "here is Barton valley.  Look up
to it, and be tranquil if you can.  Look at those hills!  Did you ever
see their equals?  To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and
plantations.  You may see the end of the house.  And there, beneath
that farthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage."
 
"It is a beautiful country," he replied "but these bottoms must be
dirty in winter."
 
"How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?"
 
"Because," replied he, smiling, "among the rest of the objects before
me, I see a very dirty lane."
 
"How strange!" said Marianne to herself as she walked on.
 
"Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?  Are the Middletons pleasant
people?"
 
"No, not all," answered Marianne "we could not be more unfortunately
situated."
 
"Marianne," cried her sister, "how can you say so? How can you be so
unjust?  They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars and towards
us have behaved in the friendliest manner.  Have you forgot, Marianne,
how many pleasant days we have owed to them?"
 
"No," said Marianne, in a low voice, "nor how many painful moments."
 
Elinor took no notice of this and directing her attention to their
visitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him, by
talking of their present residence, its conveniences, c. extorting
from him occasional questions and remarks.  His coldness and reserve
mortified her severely she was vexed and half angry but resolving to
regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present, she
avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated him
as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 17
 
 
Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him for his
coming to Barton was, in her opinion, of all things the most natural.
Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder.  He received
the kindest welcome from her and shyness, coldness, reserve could not
stand against such a reception.  They had begun to fail him before he
entered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivating
manners of Mrs. Dashwood.  Indeed a man could not very well be in love
with either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her and
Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like
himself.  His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his
interest in their welfare again became perceptible.  He was not in
spirits, however he praised their house, admired its prospect, was
attentive, and kind but still he was not in spirits.  The whole family
perceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of
liberality in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all
selfish parents.
 
"What are Mrs. Ferrarss views for you at present, Edward?" said she,
when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire "are you still
to be a great orator in spite of yourself?"
 
"No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than
inclination for a public life!"
 
"But how is your fame to be established? for famous you must be to
satisfy all your family and with no inclination for expense, no
affection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may find
it a difficult matter."
 
"I shall not attempt it.  I have no wish to be distinguished and have
every reason to hope I never shall.  Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced
into genius and eloquence."
 
"You have no ambition, I well know.  Your wishes are all moderate."
 
"As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe.  I wish as
well as every body else to be perfectly happy but, like every body
else it must be in my own way.  Greatness will not make me so."
 
"Strange that it would!" cried Marianne.  "What have wealth or grandeur
to do with happiness?"
 
"Grandeur has but little," said Elinor, "but wealth has much to do with
it."
 
"Elinor, for shame!" said Marianne, "money can only give happiness
where there is nothing else to give it.  Beyond a competence, it can
afford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned."
 
"Perhaps," said Elinor, smiling, "we may come to the same point.  YOUR
competence and MY wealth are very much alike, I dare say and without
them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind of
external comfort must be wanting.  Your ideas are only more noble than
mine.  Come, what is your competence?"
 
"About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year not more than THAT."
 
Elinor laughed.  "TWO thousand a year! ONE is my wealth! I guessed how
it would end."
 
"And yet two thousand ayear is a very moderate income," said Marianne.
"A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller.  I am sure I am not
extravagant in my demands.  A proper establishment of servants, a
carriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on less."
 
Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing so accurately their
future expenses at Combe Magna.
 
"Hunters!" repeated Edward"but why must you have hunters?  Every body
does not hunt."
 
Marianne coloured as she replied, "But most people do."
 
"I wish," said Margaret, striking out a novel thought, "that somebody
would give us all a large fortune apiece!"
 
"Oh that they would!" cried Marianne, her eyes sparkling with
animation, and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary
happiness.
 
"We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose," said Elinor, "in spite
of the insufficiency of wealth."
 
"Oh dear!" cried Margaret, "how happy I should be!  I wonder what I
should do with it!"
 
Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.
 
"I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself," said Mrs.
Dashwood, "if my children were all to be rich without my help."
 
"You must begin your improvements on this house," observed Elinor, "and
your difficulties will soon vanish."
 
"What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London," said
Edward, "in such an event!  What a happy day for booksellers,
musicsellers, and printshops!  You, Miss Dashwood, would give a
general commission for every new print of merit to be sent youand as
for Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music
enough in London to content her.  And books!Thomson, Cowper,
Scottshe would buy them all over and over again she would buy up
every copy, I believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands
and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old
twisted tree.  Should not you, Marianne?  Forgive me, if I am very
saucy.  But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our old
disputes."
 
"I love to be reminded of the past, Edwardwhether it be melancholy or
gay, I love to recall itand you will never offend me by talking of
former times.  You are very right in supposing how my money would be
spentsome of it, at leastmy loose cash would certainly be employed
in improving my collection of music and books."
 
"And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the
authors or their heirs."
 
"No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it."
 
"Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who
wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever
be in love more than once in their lifeyour opinion on that point is
unchanged, I presume?"
 
"Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed.  It is
not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them."
 
"Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see," said Elinor, "she is not
at all altered."
 
"She is only grown a little more grave than she was."
 
"Nay, Edward," said Marianne, "you need not reproach me.  You are not
very gay yourself."
 
"Why should you think so!" replied he, with a sigh.  "But gaiety never
was a part of MY character."
 
"Nor do I think it a part of Mariannes," said Elinor "I should hardly
call her a lively girlshe is very earnest, very eager in all she
doessometimes talks a great deal and always with animationbut she
is not often really merry."
 
"I believe you are right," he replied, "and yet I have always set her
down as a lively girl."
 
"I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes," said
Elinor, "in a total misapprehension of character in some point or
other fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or
stupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the
deception originated.  Sometimes one is guided by what they say of
themselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them,
without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge."
 
"But I thought it was right, Elinor," said Marianne, "to be guided
wholly by the opinion of other people.  I thought our judgments were
given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours.  This has
always been your doctrine, I am sure."
 
"No, Marianne, never.  My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of
the understanding.  All I have ever attempted to influence has been the
behaviour.  You must not confound my meaning.  I am guilty, I confess,
of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with
greater attention but when have I advised you to adopt their
sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?"
 
"You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of
general civility," said Edward to Elinor.  "Do you gain no ground?"
 
"Quite the contrary," replied Elinor, looking expressively at Marianne.
 
"My judgment," he returned, "is all on your side of the question but I
am afraid my practice is much more on your sisters.  I never wish to
offend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I
am only kept back by my natural awkwardness.  I have frequently thought
that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company, I
am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!"
 
"Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers," said
Elinor.
 
"She knows her own worth too well for false shame," replied Edward.
"Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or
other.  If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy
and graceful, I should not be shy."
 
"But you would still be reserved," said Marianne, "and that is worse."
 
Edward started"Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?"
 
"Yes, very."
 
"I do not understand you," replied he, colouring.  "Reserved!how, in
what manner?  What am I to tell you?  What can you suppose?"
 
Elinor looked surprised at his emotion but trying to laugh off the
subject, she said to him, "Do not you know my sister well enough to
understand what she means?  Do not you know she calls every one
reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as
rapturously as herself?"
 
Edward made no answer.  His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him
in their fullest extentand he sat for some time silent and dull.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 18
 
 
Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend.  His
visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction, while his own
enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect.  It was evident that he was
unhappy she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished
her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of
inspiring but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very
uncertain and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted
one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one.
 
He joined her and Marianne in the breakfastroom the next morning
before the others were down and Marianne, who was always eager to
promote their happiness as far as she could, soon left them to
themselves.  But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour
door open, and, turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself
come out.
 
"I am going into the village to see my horses," said he, "as you are
not yet ready for breakfast I shall be back again presently."
 
                    
 
Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding
country in his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of the
valley to advantage and the village itself, in a much higher situation
than the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had
exceedingly pleased him.  This was a subject which ensured Mariannes
attention, and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of
these scenes, and to question him more minutely on the objects that had
particularly struck him, when Edward interrupted her by saying, "You
must not enquire too far, Marianneremember I have no knowledge in the
picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste
if we come to particulars.  I shall call hills steep, which ought to be
bold surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and
rugged and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be
indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.  You must be
satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give.  I call it a
very fine countrythe hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine
timber, and the valley looks comfortable and snugwith rich meadows
and several neat farm houses scattered here and there.  It exactly
answers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty with
utilityand I dare say it is a picturesque one too, because you admire
it I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories, grey
moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me.  I know nothing of
the picturesque."
 
"I am afraid it is but too true," said Marianne "but why should you
boast of it?"
 
"I suspect," said Elinor, "that to avoid one kind of affectation,
Edward here falls into another.  Because he believes many people
pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really
feel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greater
indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he
possesses.  He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own."
 
"It is very true," said Marianne, "that admiration of landscape scenery
is become a mere jargon.  Every body pretends to feel and tries to
describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what
picturesque beauty was.  I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes I
have kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to
describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and
meaning."
 
"I am convinced," said Edward, "that you really feel all the delight in
a fine prospect which you profess to feel.  But, in return, your sister
must allow me to feel no more than I profess.  I like a fine prospect,
but not on picturesque principles.  I do not like crooked, twisted,
blasted trees.  I admire them much more if they are tall, straight, and
flourishing.  I do not like ruined, tattered cottages.  I am not fond
of nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms.  I have more pleasure in a
snug farmhouse than a watchtowerand a troop of tidy, happy villages
please me better than the finest banditti in the world."
 
Marianne looked with amazement at Edward, with compassion at her
sister.  Elinor only laughed.
 
The subject was continued no farther and Marianne remained
thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly engaged her attention.
She was sitting by Edward, and in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood,
his hand passed so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plait
of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.
 
"I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward," she cried.  "Is that
Fannys hair? I remember her promising to give you some.  But I should
have thought her hair had been darker."
 
Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really feltbut when she saw
how much she had pained Edward, her own vexation at her want of thought
could not be surpassed by his.  He coloured very deeply, and giving a
momentary glance at Elinor, replied, "Yes it is my sisters hair.  The
setting always casts a different shade on it, you know."
 
Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise.  That the hair
was her own, she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne
the only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianne
considered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must
have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.
She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, and
affecting to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking of
something else, she internally resolved henceforward to catch every
opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all
doubt, that it was exactly the shade of her own.
 
Edwards embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence of
mind still more settled.  He was particularly grave the whole morning.
Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said but her own
forgiveness might have been more speedy, had she known how little
offence it had given her sister.
 
Before the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs.
Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the
cottage, came to take a survey of the guest.  With the assistance of
his motherinlaw, Sir John was not long in discovering that the name
of Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of raillery
against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but the newness of their
acquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being immediately
sprung.  But, as it was, she only learned, from some very significant
looks, how far their penetration, founded on Margarets instructions,
extended.
 
Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them to
dine at the park the next day, or to drink tea with them that evening.
On the present occasion, for the better entertainment of their visitor,
towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute, he wished
to engage them for both.
 
"You MUST drink tea with us to night," said he, "for we shall be quite
aloneand tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us, for we shall be a
large party."
 
Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity.  "And who knows but you may raise
a dance," said she.  "And that will tempt YOU, Miss Marianne."
 
"A dance!" cried Marianne.  "Impossible! Who is to dance?"
 
"Who! why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers to be sure.What!
you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be
nameless is gone!"
 
"I wish with all my soul," cried Sir John, "that Willoughby were among
us again."
 
This, and Mariannes blushing, gave new suspicions to Edward.  "And who
is Willoughby?" said he, in a low voice, to Miss Dashwood, by whom he
was sitting.
 
She gave him a brief reply.  Mariannes countenance was more
communicative.  Edward saw enough to comprehend, not only the meaning
of others, but such of Mariannes expressions as had puzzled him
before and when their visitors left them, he went immediately round
her, and said, in a whisper, "I have been guessing.  Shall I tell you
my guess?"
 
"What do you mean?"
 
"Shall I tell you."
 
"Certainly."
 
"Well then I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts."
 
Marianne was surprised and confused, yet she could not help smiling at
the quiet archness of his manner, and after a moments silence, said,
 
"Oh, Edward! How can you?But the time will come I hope...I am sure
you will like him."
 
"I do not doubt it," replied he, rather astonished at her earnestness
and warmth for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of her
acquaintance in general, founded only on a something or a nothing
between Mr. Willoughby and herself, he would not have ventured to
mention it.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 19
 
 
Edward remained a week at the cottage he was earnestly pressed by Mrs.
Dashwood to stay longer but, as if he were bent only on
selfmortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment
among his friends was at the height.  His spirits, during the last two
or three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improvedhe
grew more and more partial to the house and environsnever spoke of
going away without a sighdeclared his time to be wholly
disengagedeven doubted to what place he should go when he left
thembut still, go he must.  Never had any week passed so quicklyhe
could hardly believe it to be gone.  He said so repeatedly other
things he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the
lie to his actions.  He had no pleasure at Norland he detested being
in town but either to Norland or London, he must go.  He valued their
kindness beyond any thing, and his greatest happiness was in being with
them.  Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite of their
wishes and his own, and without any restraint on his time.
 
Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his
mothers account and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose
character was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excuse
for every thing strange on the part of her son.  Disappointed, however,
and vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertain
behaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to regard
his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,
which had been rather more painfully extorted from her, for
Willoughbys service, by her mother.  His want of spirits, of openness,
and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want of
independence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrarss disposition
and designs.  The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose
in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination, the same
inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother.  The old
wellestablished grievance of duty against will, parent against child,
was the cause of all.  She would have been glad to know when these
difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to yield,when Mrs.
Ferrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy.  But
from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal
of her confidence in Edwards affection, to the remembrance of every
mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton, and
above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round
his finger.
 
"I think, Edward," said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were at breakfast the
last morning, "you would be a happier man if you had any profession to
engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions.  Some
inconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from ityou would
not be able to give them so much of your time.  But with a smile you
would be materially benefited in one particular at leastyou would
know where to go when you left them."
 
"I do assure you," he replied, "that I have long thought on this point,
as you think now.  It has been, and is, and probably will always be a
heavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage
me, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing like
independence.  But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of my
friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being.  We never
could agree in our choice of a profession.  I always preferred the
church, as I still do.  But that was not smart enough for my family.
They recommended the army.  That was a great deal too smart for me.
The law was allowed to be genteel enough many young men, who had
chambers in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first
circles, and drove about town in very knowing gigs.  But I had no
inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which
my family approved.  As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I
was too old when the subject was first started to enter itand, at
length, as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all,
as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as
with one, idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous
and honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general so
earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his
friends to do nothing.  I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been
properly idle ever since."
 
"The consequence of which, I suppose, will be," said Mrs. Dashwood,
"since leisure has not promoted your own happiness, that your sons will
be brought up to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades
as Columellas."
 
"They will be brought up," said he, in a serious accent, "to be as
unlike myself as is possible.  In feeling, in action, in condition, in
every thing."
 
"Come, come this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits,
Edward.  You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlike
yourself must be happy.  But remember that the pain of parting from
friends will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their
education or state.  Know your own happiness.  You want nothing but
patienceor give it a more fascinating name, call it hope.  Your
mother will secure to you, in time, that independence you are so
anxious for it is her duty, and it will, it must ere long become her
happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent.
How much may not a few months do?"
 
"I think," replied Edward, "that I may defy many months to produce any
good to me."
 
This desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated to
Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all in the parting, which
shortly took place, and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinors
feelings especially, which required some trouble and time to subdue.
But as it was her determination to subdue it, and to prevent herself
from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his
going away, she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by
Marianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow, by
seeking silence, solitude and idleness.  Their means were as different
as their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of each.
 
Elinor sat down to her drawingtable as soon as he was out of the
house, busily employed herself the whole day, neither sought nor
avoided the mention of his name, appeared to interest herself almost as
much as ever in the general concerns of the family, and if, by this
conduct, she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented
from unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters were spared much
solicitude on her account.
 
Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her own, appeared no
more meritorious to Marianne, than her own had seemed faulty to her.
The business of selfcommand she settled very easilywith strong
affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could have no merit.
That her sisters affections WERE calm, she dared not deny, though she
blushed to acknowledge it and of the strength of her own, she gave a
very striking proof, by still loving and respecting that sister, in
spite of this mortifying conviction.
 
Without shutting herself up from her family, or leaving the house in
determined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake the whole night to
indulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough
to think of Edward, and of Edwards behaviour, in every possible
variety which the different state of her spirits at different times
could produce,with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.
There were moments in abundance, when, if not by the absence of her
mother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments,
conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude was
produced.  Her mind was inevitably at liberty her thoughts could not
be chained elsewhere and the past and the future, on a subject so
interesting, must be before her, must force her attention, and engross
her memory, her reflection, and her fancy.
 
From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her drawingtable, she was
roused one morning, soon after Edwards leaving them, by the arrival of
company.  She happened to be quite alone.  The closing of the little
gate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drew
her eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to the
door.  Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings,
but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were quite unknown
to her.  She was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir John
perceived her, he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of
knocking at the door, and stepping across the turf, obliged her to open
the casement to speak to him, though the space was so short between the
door and the window, as to make it hardly possible to speak at one
without being heard at the other.
 
"Well," said he, "we have brought you some strangers.  How do you like
them?"
 
"Hush! they will hear you."
 
"Never mind if they do.  It is only the Palmers.  Charlotte is very
pretty, I can tell you.  You may see her if you look this way."
 
As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes, without
taking that liberty, she begged to be excused.
 
"Where is Marianne? Has she run away because we are come? I see her
instrument is open."
 
"She is walking, I believe."
 
They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not patience enough to
wait till the door was opened before she told HER story.  She came
hallooing to the window, "How do you do, my dear?  How does Mrs.
Dashwood do?  And where are your sisters?  What! all alone! you will be
glad of a little company to sit with you.  I have brought my other son
and daughter to see you.  Only think of their coming so suddenly!  I
thought I heard a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea,
but it never entered my head that it could be them.  I thought of
nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again so
I said to Sir John, I do think I hear a carriage perhaps it is Colonel
Brandon come back again"
 
Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle of her story, to
receive the rest of the party Lady Middleton introduced the two
strangers Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same
time, and they all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings
continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour,
attended by Sir John.
 
Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and totally
unlike her in every respect.  She was short and plump, had a very
pretty face, and the finest expression of good humour in it that could
possibly be.  Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sisters,
but they were much more prepossessing.  She came in with a smile,
smiled all the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiled
when she went away.  Her husband was a grave looking young man of five
or six and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife,
but of less willingness to please or be pleased.  He entered the room
with a look of selfconsequence, slightly bowed to the ladies, without
speaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their
apartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read
it as long as he staid.
 
Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed by nature with a
turn for being uniformly civil and happy, was hardly seated before her
admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth.
 
"Well! what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything so
charming!  Only think, Mama, how it is improved since I was here last!
I always thought it such a sweet place, maam! turning to Mrs.
Dashwood but you have made it so charming!  Only look, sister, how
delightful every thing is! How I should like such a house for myself!
Should not you, Mr. Palmer?"
 
Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise his eyes from the
newspaper.
 
"Mr. Palmer does not hear me," said she, laughing "he never does
sometimes.  It is so ridiculous!"
 
This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood she had never been used to
find wit in the inattention of any one, and could not help looking with
surprise at them both.
 
Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud as she could, and
continued her account of their surprise, the evening before, on seeing
their friends, without ceasing till every thing was told.  Mrs. Palmer
laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment, and every
body agreed, two or three times over, that it had been quite an
agreeable surprise.
 
"You may believe how glad we all were to see them," added Mrs.
Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor, and speaking in a low voice
as if she meant to be heard by no one else, though they were seated on
different sides of the room "but, however, I cant help wishing they
had not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it,
for they came all round by London upon account of some business, for
you know nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter it was
wrong in her situation.  I wanted her to stay at home and rest this
morning, but she would come with us she longed so much to see you all!"
 
Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her any harm.
 
"She expects to be confined in February," continued Mrs. Jennings.
 
Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation, and
therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in
the paper.
 
"No, none at all," he replied, and read on.
 
"Here comes Marianne," cried Sir John.  "Now, Palmer, you shall see a
monstrous pretty girl."
 
He immediately went into the passage, opened the front door, and
ushered her in himself.  Mrs. Jennings asked her, as soon as she
appeared, if she had not been to Allenham and Mrs. Palmer laughed so
heartily at the question, as to show she understood it.  Mr. Palmer
looked up on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes, and
then returned to his newspaper.  Mrs. Palmers eye was now caught by
the drawings which hung round the room.  She got up to examine them.
 
"Oh! dear, how beautiful these are!  Well! how delightful!  Do but
look, mama, how sweet! I declare they are quite charming I could look
at them for ever." And then sitting down again, she very soon forgot
that there were any such things in the room.
 
When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer rose also, laid down
the newspaper, stretched himself and looked at them all around.
 
"My love, have you been asleep?" said his wife, laughing.
 
He made her no answer and only observed, after again examining the
room, that it was very low pitched, and that the ceiling was crooked.
He then made his bow, and departed with the rest.
 
Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at
the park.  Mrs. Dashwood, who did not chuse to dine with them oftener
than they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account
her daughters might do as they pleased.  But they had no curiosity to
see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation of
pleasure from them in any other way.  They attempted, therefore,
likewise, to excuse themselves the weather was uncertain, and not
likely to be good.  But Sir John would not be satisfiedthe carriage
should be sent for them and they must come.  Lady Middleton too, though
she did not press their mother, pressed them.  Mrs. Jennings and Mrs.
Palmer joined their entreaties, all seemed equally anxious to avoid a
family party and the young ladies were obliged to yield.
 
"Why should they ask us?" said Marianne, as soon as they were gone.
"The rent of this cottage is said to be low but we have it on very
hard terms, if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying
either with them, or with us."
 
"They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now," said Elinor, "by
these frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them a
few weeks ago.  The alteration is not in them, if their parties are
grown tedious and dull.  We must look for the change elsewhere."
 
 
 
CHAPTER 20
 
 
As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawingroom of the park the next
day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at the other, looking as
good humoured and merry as before.  She took them all most
affectionately by the hand, and expressed great delight in seeing them
again.
 
"I am so glad to see you!" said she, seating herself between Elinor and
Marianne, "for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come,
which would be a shocking thing, as we go away again tomorrow. We must
go, for the Westons come to us next week you know.  It was quite a
sudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the
carriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I
would go with him to Barton.  He is so droll! He never tells me any
thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer however we shall meet again
in town very soon, I hope."
 
They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.
 
"Not go to town!" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, "I shall be quite
disappointed if you do not.  I could get the nicest house in world for
you, next door to ours, in Hanoversquare.  You must come, indeed.  I
am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am
confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public."
 
They thanked her but were obliged to resist all her entreaties.
 
"Oh, my love," cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband, who just then entered
the room"you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to
town this winter."
 
Her love made no answer and after slightly bowing to the ladies, began
complaining of the weather.
 
"How horrid all this is!" said he.  "Such weather makes every thing and
every body disgusting.  Dullness is as much produced within doors as
without, by rain.  It makes one detest all ones acquaintance.  What
the devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his
house?  How few people know what comfort is!  Sir John is as stupid as
the weather."
 
The rest of the company soon dropt in.
 
"I am afraid, Miss Marianne," said Sir John, "you have not been able to
take your usual walk to Allenham today."
 
Marianne looked very grave and said nothing.
 
"Oh, dont be so sly before us," said Mrs. Palmer "for we know all
about it, I assure you and I admire your taste very much, for I think
he is extremely handsome.  We do not live a great way from him in the
country, you know.  Not above ten miles, I dare say."
 
"Much nearer thirty," said her husband.
 
"Ah, well! there is not much difference.  I never was at his house but
they say it is a sweet pretty place."
 
"As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life," said Mr. Palmer.
 
Marianne remained perfectly silent, though her countenance betrayed her
interest in what was said.
 
"Is it very ugly?" continued Mrs. Palmer"then it must be some other
place that is so pretty I suppose."
 
When they were seated in the dining room, Sir John observed with regret
that they were only eight all together.
 
"My dear," said he to his lady, "it is very provoking that we should be
so few.  Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today?"
 
"Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me about it before,
that it could not be done?  They dined with us last."
 
"You and I, Sir John," said Mrs. Jennings, "should not stand upon such
ceremony."
 
"Then you would be very illbred," cried Mr. Palmer.
 
"My love you contradict every body," said his wife with her usual
laugh.  "Do you know that you are quite rude?"
 
"I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother
illbred."
 
"Ay, you may abuse me as you please," said the goodnatured old lady,
"you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot give her back again.
So there I have the whip hand of you."
 
Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid
of her and exultingly said, she did not care how cross he was to her,
as they must live together.  It was impossible for any one to be more
thoroughly goodnatured, or more determined to be happy than Mrs.
Palmer.  The studied indifference, insolence, and discontent of her
husband gave her no pain and when he scolded or abused her, she was
highly diverted.
 
"Mr. Palmer is so droll!" said she, in a whisper, to Elinor.  "He is
always out of humour."
 
Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him credit
for being so genuinely and unaffectedly illnatured or illbred as he
wished to appear.  His temper might perhaps be a little soured by
finding, like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable
bias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly
woman,but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any
sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it. It was rather a wish of
distinction, she believed, which produced his contemptuous treatment of
every body, and his general abuse of every thing before him.  It was
the desire of appearing superior to other people.  The motive was too
common to be wondered at but the means, however they might succeed by
establishing his superiority in illbreeding, were not likely to attach
any one to him except his wife.
 
"Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood," said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards, "I have
got such a favour to ask of you and your sister.  Will you come and
spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas?  Now, pray do,and come
while the Westons are with us.  You cannot think how happy I shall be!
It will be quite delightful!My love," applying to her husband, "dont
you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?"
 
"Certainly," he replied, with a sneer"I came into Devonshire with no
other view."
 
"There now,"said his lady, "you see Mr. Palmer expects you so you
cannot refuse to come."
 
They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation.
 
"But indeed you must and shall come.  I am sure you will like it of all
things.  The Westons will be with us, and it will be quite delightful.
You cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is and we are so gay
now, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing
against the election and so many people came to dine with us that I
never saw before, it is quite charming!  But, poor fellow! it is very
fatiguing to him! for he is forced to make every body like him."
 
Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the
hardship of such an obligation.
 
"How charming it will be," said Charlotte, "when he is in
Parliament!wont it? How I shall laugh!  It will be so ridiculous to
see all his letters directed to him with an M.P.But do you know, he
says, he will never frank for me?  He declares he wont.  Dont you,
Mr. Palmer?"
 
Mr. Palmer took no notice of her.
 
"He cannot bear writing, you know," she continued"he says it is quite
shocking."
 
"No," said he, "I never said any thing so irrational.  Dont palm all
your abuses of languages upon me."
 
"There now you see how droll he is.  This is always the way with him!
Sometimes he wont speak to me for half a day together, and then he
comes out with something so drollall about any thing in the world."
 
She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawingroom,
by asking her whether she did not like Mr. Palmer excessively.
 
"Certainly," said Elinor "he seems very agreeable."
 
"WellI am so glad you do.  I thought you would, he is so pleasant
and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can
tell you, and you cant think how disappointed he will be if you dont
come to Cleveland.I cant imagine why you should object to it."
 
Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation and by changing the
subject, put a stop to her entreaties.  She thought it probable that as
they lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some
more particular account of Willoughbys general character, than could
be gathered from the Middletons partial acquaintance with him and she
was eager to gain from any one, such a confirmation of his merits as
might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne.  She began by
inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland, and whether
they were intimately acquainted with him.
 
"Oh dear, yes I know him extremely well," replied Mrs. Palmer"Not
that I ever spoke to him, indeed but I have seen him for ever in town.
Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was
at Allenham.  Mama saw him here once beforebut I was with my uncle
at Weymouth.  However, I dare say we should have seen a great deal of
him in Somersetshire, if it had not happened very unluckily that we
should never have been in the country together.  He is very little at
Combe, I believe but if he were ever so much there, I do not think Mr.
Palmer would visit him, for he is in the opposition, you know, and
besides it is such a way off.  I know why you inquire about him, very
well your sister is to marry him.  I am monstrous glad of it, for then
I shall have her for a neighbour you know."
 
"Upon my word," replied Elinor, "you know much more of the matter than
I do, if you have any reason to expect such a match."
 
"Dont pretend to deny it, because you know it is what every body talks
of.  I assure you I heard of it in my way through town."
 
"My dear Mrs. Palmer!"
 
"Upon my honour I did.I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in
Bondstreet, just before we left town, and he told me of it directly."
 
"You surprise me very much.  Colonel Brandon tell you of it!  Surely
you must be mistaken.  To give such intelligence to a person who could
not be interested in it, even if it were true, is not what I should
expect Colonel Brandon to do."
 
"But I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you how
it happened.  When we met him, he turned back and walked with us and
so we began talking of my brother and sister, and one thing and
another, and I said to him, So, Colonel, there is a new family come to
Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very pretty,
and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe
Magna.  Is it true, pray? for of course you must know, as you have been
in Devonshire so lately."
 
"And what did the Colonel say?"
 
"Ohhe did not say much but he looked as if he knew it to be true, so
from that moment I set it down as certain.  It will be quite
delightful, I declare!  When is it to take place?"
 
"Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?"
 
"Oh! yes, quite well and so full of your praises, he did nothing but
say fine things of you."
 
"I am flattered by his commendation.  He seems an excellent man and I
think him uncommonly pleasing."
 
"So do I.He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he should
be so grave and so dull.  Mama says HE was in love with your sister
too. I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardly
ever falls in love with any body."
 
"Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?" said
Elinor.
 
"Oh! yes, extremely well that is, I do not believe many people are
acquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off but they all
think him extremely agreeable I assure you.  Nobody is more liked than
Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister.  She
is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour not but that he
is much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome and
agreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her.  However, I dont
think her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you for I think
you both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure,
though we could not get him to own it last night."
 
Mrs. Palmers information respecting Willoughby was not very material
but any testimony in his favour, however small, was pleasing to her.
 
"I am so glad we are got acquainted at last," continued
Charlotte."And now I hope we shall always be great friends.  You
cant think how much I longed to see you!  It is so delightful that you
should live at the cottage!  Nothing can be like it, to be sure!  And I
am so glad your sister is going to be well married!  I hope you will be
a great deal at Combe Magna.  It is a sweet place, by all accounts."
 
"You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon, have not you?"
 
"Yes, a great while ever since my sister married. He was a
particular friend of Sir Johns. I believe," she added in a low voice,
"he would have been very glad to have had me, if he could.  Sir John
and Lady Middleton wished it very much.  But mama did not think the
match good enough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to
the Colonel, and we should have been married immediately."
 
"Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir Johns proposal to your mother
before it was made?  Had he never owned his affection to yourself?"
 
"Oh, no but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he would have
liked it of all things.  He had not seen me then above twice, for it
was before I left school.  However, I am much happier as I am.  Mr.
Palmer is the kind of man I like."
 
 
 
CHAPTER 21
 
 
The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families at
Barton were again left to entertain each other.  But this did not last
long Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head, had
hardly done wondering at Charlottes being so happy without a cause, at
Mr. Palmers acting so simply, with good abilities, and at the strange
unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife, before Sir
Johns and Mrs. Jenningss active zeal in the cause of society,
procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe.
 
In a mornings excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young ladies,
whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her
relations, and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly to
the park, as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over.
Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such an
invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the
return of Sir John, by hearing that she was very soon to receive a
visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose
elegance,whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof for
the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for
nothing at all.  Their being her relations too made it so much the
worse and Mrs. Jenningss attempts at consolation were therefore
unfortunately founded, when she advised her daughter not to care about
their being so fashionable because they were all cousins and must put
up with one another.  As it was impossible, however, now to prevent
their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, with
all the philosophy of a wellbred woman, contenting herself with merely
giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times
every day.
 
The young ladies arrived their appearance was by no means ungenteel or
unfashionable.  Their dress was very smart, their manners very civil,
they were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the furniture,
and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that Lady
Middletons good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had
been an hour at the Park.  She declared them to be very agreeable girls
indeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration.  Sir Johns
confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise, and he
set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss
Steeles arrival, and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls
in the world.  From such commendation as this, however, there was not
much to be learned Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the
world were to be met with in every part of England, under every
possible variation of form, face, temper and understanding.  Sir John
wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at his
guests.  Benevolent, philanthropic man!  It was painful to him even to
keep a third cousin to himself.
 
"Do come now," said he"pray comeyou must comeI declare you shall
comeYou cant think how you will like them.  Lucy is monstrous
pretty, and so good humoured and agreeable!  The children are all
hanging about her already, as if she was an old acquaintance.  And they
both long to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter that
you are the most beautiful creatures in the world and I have told them
it is all very true, and a great deal more.  You will be delighted with
them I am sure.  They have brought the whole coach full of playthings
for the children.  How can you be so cross as not to come?  Why they
are your cousins, you know, after a fashion.  YOU are my cousins, and
they are my wifes, so you must be related."
 
But Sir John could not prevail.  He could only obtain a promise of
their calling at the Park within a day or two, and then left them in
amazement at their indifference, to walk home and boast anew of their
attractions to the Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of the
Miss Steeles to them.
 
When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to
these young ladies took place, they found in the appearance of the
eldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very plain and not a sensible
face, nothing to admire but in the other, who was not more than two or
three and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty her features
were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a smartness of air,
which though it did not give actual elegance or grace, gave distinction
to her person. Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon
allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she saw with what
constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable
to Lady Middleton.  With her children they were in continual raptures,
extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their
whims and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate
demands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration of
whatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be doing any thing,
or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which her
appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.
Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles, a fond
mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the most
rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous her demands
are exorbitant but she will swallow any thing and the excessive
affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring were
viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or
distrust.  She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent
encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.
She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, their
workbags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen away, and felt
no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment.  It suggested no other
surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by,
without claiming a share in what was passing.
 
"John is in such spirits today!" said she, on his taking Miss Steeless
pocket handkerchief, and throwing it out of window"He is full of
monkey tricks."
 
And soon afterwards, on the second boys violently pinching one of the
same ladys fingers, she fondly observed, "How playful William is!"
 
"And here is my sweet little Annamaria," she added, tenderly caressing
a little girl of three years old, who had not made a noise for the last
two minutes "And she is always so gentle and quietNever was there
such a quiet little thing!"
 
But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyships
head dress slightly scratching the childs neck, produced from this
pattern of gentleness such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone
by any creature professedly noisy.  The mothers consternation was
excessive but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and
every thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, which
affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little
sufferer.  She was seated in her mothers lap, covered with kisses, her
wound bathed with lavenderwater, by one of the Miss Steeles, who was
on her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by
the other.  With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise to
cease crying.  She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her two
brothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings were
ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of
similar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had been
successfully applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly
proposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission of
screams in the young lady on hearing it, gave them reason to hope that
it would not be rejected. She was carried out of the room therefore
in her mothers arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the two boys
chose to follow, though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay
behind, the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room
had not known for many hours.
 
"Poor little creatures!" said Miss Steele, as soon as they were gone.
"It might have been a very sad accident."
 
"Yet I hardly know how," cried Marianne, "unless it had been under
totally different circumstances.  But this is the usual way of
heightening alarm, where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality."
 
"What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!" said Lucy Steele.
 
Marianne was silent it was impossible for her to say what she did not
feel, however trivial the occasion and upon Elinor therefore the whole
task of telling lies when politeness required it, always fell.  She did
her best when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton with more
warmth than she felt, though with far less than Miss Lucy.
 
"And Sir John too," cried the elder sister, "what a charming man he is!"
 
Here too, Miss Dashwoods commendation, being only simple and just,
came in without any eclat.  She merely observed that he was perfectly
good humoured and friendly.
 
"And what a charming little family they have!  I never saw such fine
children in my life.I declare I quite doat upon them already, and
indeed I am always distractedly fond of children."
 
"I should guess so," said Elinor, with a smile, "from what I have
witnessed this morning."
 
"I have a notion," said Lucy, "you think the little Middletons rather
too much indulged perhaps they may be the outside of enough but it is
so natural in Lady Middleton and for my part, I love to see children
full of life and spirits I cannot bear them if they are tame and
quiet."
 
"I confess," replied Elinor, "that while I am at Barton Park, I never
think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence."
 
A short pause succeeded this speech, which was first broken by Miss
Steele, who seemed very much disposed for conversation, and who now
said rather abruptly, "And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?
I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex."
 
In some surprise at the familiarity of this question, or at least of
the manner in which it was spoken, Elinor replied that she was.
 
"Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?" added Miss Steele.
 
"We have heard Sir John admire it excessively," said Lucy, who seemed
to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister.
 
"I think every one MUST admire it," replied Elinor, "who ever saw the
place though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its
beauties as we do."
 
"And had you a great many smart beaux there?  I suppose you have not so
many in this part of the world for my part, I think they are a vast
addition always."
 
"But why should you think," said Lucy, looking ashamed of her sister,
"that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex?"
 
"Nay, my dear, Im sure I dont pretend to say that there ant.  Im
sure theres a vast many smart beaux in Exeter but you know, how could
I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland and I was only
afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they had not
so many as they used to have.  But perhaps you young ladies may not
care about the beaux, and had as lief be without them as with them.
For my part, I think they are vastly agreeable, provided they dress
smart and behave civil.  But I cant bear to see them dirty and nasty.
Now theres Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man, quite a
beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you do but meet him of
a morning, he is not fit to be seen. I suppose your brother was quite
a beau, Miss Dashwood, before he married, as he was so rich?"
 
"Upon my word," replied Elinor, "I cannot tell you, for I do not
perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word.  But this I can say, that
if he ever was a beau before he married, he is one still for there is
not the smallest alteration in him."
 
"Oh! dear! one never thinks of married mens being beauxthey have
something else to do."
 
"Lord! Anne," cried her sister, "you can talk of nothing but
beauxyou will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else."
And then to turn the discourse, she began admiring the house and the
furniture.
 
This specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough.  The vulgar freedom and
folly of the eldest left her no recommendation, and as Elinor was not
blinded by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest, to her want
of real elegance and artlessness, she left the house without any wish
of knowing them better.
 
Not so the Miss Steeles.They came from Exeter, well provided with
admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton, his family, and all his
relations, and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair
cousins, whom they declared to be the most beautiful, elegant,
accomplished, and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom
they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted. And to be
better acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found was their inevitable
lot, for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles,
their party would be too strong for opposition, and that kind of
intimacy must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour or two
together in the same room almost every day.  Sir John could do no more
but he did not know that any more was required to be together was, in
his opinion, to be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their
meeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being established
friends.
 
To do him justice, he did every thing in his power to promote their
unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew
or supposed of his cousins situations in the most delicate
particulars,and Elinor had not seen them more than twice, before the
eldest of them wished her joy on her sisters having been so lucky as
to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton.
 
"Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure," said
she, "and I hear he is quite a beau, and prodigious handsome.  And I
hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,but perhaps you may have
a friend in the corner already."
 
Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in
proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward, than he had been
with respect to Marianne indeed it was rather his favourite joke of
the two, as being somewhat newer and more conjectural and since
Edwards visit, they had never dined together without his drinking to
her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and
winks, as to excite general attention.  The letter Fhad been likewise
invariably brought forward, and found productive of such countless
jokes, that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had
been long established with Elinor.
 
The Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now all the benefit of these
jokes, and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the
name of the gentleman alluded to, which, though often impertinently
expressed, was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness
into the concerns of their family.  But Sir John did not sport long
with the curiosity which he delighted to raise, for he had at least as
much pleasure in telling the name, as Miss Steele had in hearing it.
 
"His name is Ferrars," said he, in a very audible whisper "but pray do
not tell it, for its a great secret."
 
"Ferrars!" repeated Miss Steele "Mr. Ferrars is the happy man, is he?
What! your sisterinlaws brother, Miss Dashwood? a very agreeable
young man to be sure I know him very well."
 
"How can you say so, Anne?" cried Lucy, who generally made an amendment
to all her sisters assertions.  "Though we have seen him once or twice
at my uncles, it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well."
 
Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise.  "And who was this
uncle?  Where did he live?  How came they acquainted?"  She wished very
much to have the subject continued, though she did not chuse to join in
it herself but nothing more of it was said, and for the first time in
her life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity after
petty information, or in a disposition to communicate it.  The manner
in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward, increased her curiosity for
it struck her as being rather illnatured, and suggested the suspicion
of that ladys knowing, or fancying herself to know something to his
disadvantage.But her curiosity was unavailing, for no farther notice
was taken of Mr. Ferrarss name by Miss Steele when alluded to, or even
openly mentioned by Sir John.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 22
 
 
Marianne, who had never much toleration for any thing like
impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts, or even difference of
taste from herself, was at this time particularly illdisposed, from
the state of her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles, or to
encourage their advances and to the invariable coldness of her
behaviour towards them, which checked every endeavour at intimacy on
their side, Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself
which soon became evident in the manners of both, but especially of
Lucy, who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation, or of
striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank
communication of her sentiments.
 
Lucy was naturally clever her remarks were often just and amusing and
as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her agreeable
but her powers had received no aid from education she was ignorant and
illiterate and her deficiency of all mental improvement, her want of
information in the most common particulars, could not be concealed from
Miss Dashwood, in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to
advantage.  Elinor saw, and pitied her for, the neglect of abilities
which education might have rendered so respectable but she saw, with
less tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy, of
rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions, her
assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed and she could have no
lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity
with ignorance whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in
conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct toward others made
every shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectly
valueless.
 
"You will think my question an odd one, I dare say," said Lucy to her
one day, as they were walking together from the park to the
cottage"but pray, are you personally acquainted with your
sisterinlaws mother, Mrs. Ferrars?"
 
Elinor DID think the question a very odd one, and her countenance
expressed it, as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.
 
"Indeed!" replied Lucy "I wonder at that, for I thought you must have
seen her at Norland sometimes.  Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what
sort of a woman she is?"
 
"No," returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real opinion of Edwards
mother, and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent
curiosity "I know nothing of her."
 
"I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in such a
way," said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke "but perhaps
there may be reasonsI wish I might venture but however I hope you
will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be
impertinent."
 
Elinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on for a few minutes in
silence.  It was broken by Lucy, who renewed the subject again by
saying, with some hesitation,
 
"I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious.  I am sure I
would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person
whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours.  And I am sure I
should not have the smallest fear of trusting YOU indeed, I should be
very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable
situation as I am but, however, there is no occasion to trouble YOU.
I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars."
 
"I am sorry I do NOT," said Elinor, in great astonishment, "if it could
be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her.  But really I never
understood that you were at all connected with that family, and
therefore I am a little surprised, I confess, at so serious an inquiry
into her character."
 
"I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it.  But
if I dared tell you all, you would not be so much surprised.  Mrs.
Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at presentbut the time MAY
comehow soon it will come must depend upon herselfwhen we may be
very intimately connected."
 
She looked down as she said this, amiably bashful, with only one side
glance at her companion to observe its effect on her.
 
"Good heavens!" cried Elinor, "what do you mean?  Are you acquainted
with Mr. Robert Ferrars?  Can you be?" And she did not feel much
delighted with the idea of such a sisterinlaw.
 
"No," replied Lucy, "not to Mr. ROBERT FerrarsI never saw him in my
life but," fixing her eyes upon Elinor, "to his eldest brother."
 
What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment, that would have been as
painful as it was strong, had not an immediate disbelief of the
assertion attended it.  She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement,
unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration and though
her complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity, and felt in no
danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.
 
"You may well be surprised," continued Lucy "for to be sure you could
have had no idea of it before for I dare say he never dropped the
smallest hint of it to you or any of your family because it was always
meant to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully kept so
by me to this hour.  Not a soul of all my relations know of it but
Anne, and I never should have mentioned it to you, if I had not felt
the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy and I really
thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars
must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained.  And I do not think
Mr. Ferrars can be displeased, when he knows I have trusted you,
because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your
family, and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as
his own sisters."She paused.
 
Elinor for a few moments remained silent.  Her astonishment at what she
heard was at first too great for words but at length forcing herself
to speak, and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,
which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude "May I ask
if your engagement is of long standing?"
 
"We have been engaged these four years."
 
"Four years!"
 
"Yes."
 
Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it.
 
"I did not know," said she, "that you were even acquainted till the
other day."
 
"Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date.  He was under my
uncles care, you know, a considerable while."
 
"Your uncle!"
 
"Yes Mr. Pratt.  Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt?"
 
"I think I have," replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, which
increased with her increase of emotion.
 
"He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple, near
Plymouth.  It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and me
was often staying with my uncle, and it was there our engagement was
formed, though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil but he
was almost always with us afterwards.  I was very unwilling to enter
into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of
his mother but I was too young, and loved him too well, to be so
prudent as I ought to have been. Though you do not know him so well
as me, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to be sensible
he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him."
 
"Certainly," answered Elinor, without knowing what she said but after
a moments reflection, she added, with revived security of Edwards
honour and love, and her companions falsehood"Engaged to Mr. Edward
Ferrars!I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me,
that reallyI beg your pardon but surely there must be some mistake
of person or name.  We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars."
 
"We can mean no other," cried Lucy, smiling.  "Mr. Edward Ferrars, the
eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street, and brother of your
sisterinlaw, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I mean you must allow
that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who
all my happiness depends."
 
"It is strange," replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, "that I
should never have heard him even mention your name."
 
"No considering our situation, it was not strange.  Our first care has
been to keep the matter secret. You knew nothing of me, or my family,
and, therefore, there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name
to you and, as he was always particularly afraid of his sisters
suspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough for his not mentioning it."
 
She was silent.Elinors security sunk but her selfcommand did not
sink with it.
 
"Four years you have been engaged," said she with a firm voice.
 
"Yes and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait.  Poor
Edward!  It puts him quite out of heart." Then taking a small miniature
from her pocket, she added, "To prevent the possibility of mistake, be
so good as to look at this face.  It does not do him justice, to be
sure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was
drew for.I have had it above these three years."
 
She put it into her hands as she spoke and when Elinor saw the
painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision, or
her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind, she
could have none of its being Edwards face.  She returned it almost
instantly, acknowledging the likeness.
 
"I have never been able," continued Lucy, "to give him my picture in
return, which I am very much vexed at, for he has been always so
anxious to get it!  But I am determined to set for it the very first
opportunity."
 
"You are quite in the right," replied Elinor calmly.  They then
proceeded a few paces in silence.  Lucy spoke first.
 
"I am sure," said she, "I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully
keeping this secret, because you must know of what importance it is to
us, not to have it reach his mother for she would never approve of it,
I dare say.  I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding
proud woman."
 
"I certainly did not seek your confidence," said Elinor "but you do me
no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on.  Your
secret is safe with me but pardon me if I express some surprise at so
unnecessary a communication.  You must at least have felt that my being
acquainted with it could not add to its safety."
 
As she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy, hoping to discover
something in her countenance perhaps the falsehood of the greatest
part of what she had been saying but Lucys countenance suffered no
change.
 
"I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you,"
said she, "in telling you all this.  I have not known you long to be
sure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family by
description a great while and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as
if you was an old acquaintance.  Besides in the present case, I really
thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular
inquiries about Edwards mother and I am so unfortunate, that I have
not a creature whose advice I can ask.  Anne is the only person that
knows of it, and she has no judgment at all indeed, she does me a
great deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her
betraying me.  She does not know how to hold her tongue, as you must
perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world
tother day, when Edwards name was mentioned by Sir John, lest she
should out with it all.  You cant think how much I go through in my
mind from it altogether.  I only wonder that I am alive after what I
have suffered for Edwards sake these last four years.  Every thing in
such suspense and uncertainty and seeing him so seldomwe can hardly
meet above twice ayear.  I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite
broke."
 
Here she took out her handkerchief but Elinor did not feel very
compassionate.
 
"Sometimes." continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes, "I think whether it
would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely."  As
she said this, she looked directly at her companion.  "But then at
other times I have not resolution enough for it. I cannot bear the
thoughts of making him so miserable, as I know the very mention of such
a thing would do.  And on my own account tooso dear as he is to meI
dont think I could be equal to it.  What would you advise me to do in
such a case, Miss Dashwood?  What would you do yourself?"
 
"Pardon me," replied Elinor, startled by the question "but I can give
you no advice under such circumstances.  Your own judgment must direct
you."
 
"To be sure," continued Lucy, after a few minutes silence on both
sides, "his mother must provide for him sometime or other but poor
Edward is so cast down by it!  Did you not think him dreadful
lowspirited when he was at Barton?  He was so miserable when he left
us at Longstaple, to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him
quite ill."
 
"Did he come from your uncles, then, when he visited us?"
 
"Oh, yes he had been staying a fortnight with us.  Did you think he
came directly from town?"
 
"No," replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of every fresh
circumstance in favour of Lucys veracity "I remember he told us, that
he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth." She
remembered too, her own surprise at the time, at his mentioning nothing
farther of those friends, at his total silence with respect even to
their names.
 
"Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?" repeated Lucy.
 
"We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived."
 
"I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the
matter but it made him so melancholy, not being able to stay more than
a fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected. Poor fellow!I
am afraid it is just the same with him now for he writes in wretched
spirits.  I heard from him just before I left Exeter" taking a letter
from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor.  "You
know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is but that is not
written so well as usual.He was tired, I dare say, for he had just
filled the sheet to me as full as possible."
 
Elinor saw that it WAS his hand, and she could doubt no longer.  This
picture, she had allowed herself to believe, might have been
accidentally obtained it might not have been Edwards gift but a
correspondence between them by letter, could subsist only under a
positive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else for a few
moments, she was almost overcomeher heart sunk within her, and she
could hardly stand but exertion was indispensably necessary and she
struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings, that
her success was speedy, and for the time complete.
 
"Writing to each other," said Lucy, returning the letter into her
pocket, "is the only comfort we have in such long separations.  Yes, I
have one other comfort in his picture, but poor Edward has not even
THAT.  If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy.  I gave him
a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last, and
that was some comfort to him, he said, but not equal to a picture.
Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him?"
 
"I did," said Elinor, with a composure of voice, under which was
concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt
before.  She was mortified, shocked, confounded.
 
Fortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage, and the
conversation could be continued no farther.  After sitting with them a
few minutes, the Miss Steeles returned to the Park, and Elinor was then
at liberty to think and be wretched.

CHAPTER 23
 
 
However small Elinors general dependence on Lucys veracity might be,
it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the
present case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of
inventing a falsehood of such a description.  What Lucy had asserted to
be true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt supported
as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs, and
contradicted by nothing but her own wishes.  Their opportunity of
acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest,
at once indisputable and alarming and Edwards visit near Plymouth,
his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at his own prospects,
his uncertain behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the
Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections, which had
often surprised her, the picture, the letter, the ring, formed
altogether such a body of evidence, as overcame every fear of
condemning him unfairly, and established as a fact, which no partiality
could set aside, his illtreatment of herself.Her resentment of such
behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe, for a short time
made her feel only for herself but other ideas, other considerations,
soon arose.  Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her?  Had he
feigned a regard for her which he did not feel?  Was his engagement to
Lucy an engagement of the heart?  No whatever it might once have been,
she could not believe it such at present.  His affection was all her
own.  She could not be deceived in that.  Her mother, sisters, Fanny,
all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland it was not an
illusion of her own vanity.  He certainly loved her.  What a softener
of the heart was this persuasion!  How much could it not tempt her to
forgive!  He had been blamable, highly blamable, in remaining at
Norland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than it
ought to be.  In that, he could not be defended but if he had injured
her, how much more had he injured himself if her case were pitiable,
his was hopeless.  His imprudence had made her miserable for a while
but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being
otherwise.  She might in time regain tranquillity but HE, what had he
to look forward to?  Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele
could he, were his affection for herself out of the question, with his
integrity, his delicacy, and wellinformed mind, be satisfied with a
wife like herilliterate, artful, and selfish?
 
The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every
thing but her beauty and good nature but the four succeeding
yearsyears, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to the
understanding, must have opened his eyes to her defects of education,
while the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior society
and more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity
which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty.
 
If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself, his difficulties
from his mother had seemed great, how much greater were they now likely
to be, when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in
connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself.  These
difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated from Lucy, might not
press very hard upon his patience but melancholy was the state of the
person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness,
could be felt as a relief!
 
As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession, she wept
for him, more than for herself.  Supported by the conviction of having
done nothing to merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by the
belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem, she thought
she could even now, under the first smart of the heavy blow, command
herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother
and sisters.  And so well was she able to answer her own expectations,
that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first
suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one would have
supposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning
in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object
of her love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the
perfections of a man, of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly
possessed, and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove
near their house.
 
The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne, what had been
entrusted in confidence to herself, though it obliged her to unceasing
exertion, was no aggravation of Elinors distress.  On the contrary it
was a relief to her, to be spared the communication of what would give
such affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from hearing that
condemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from the excess of
their partial affection for herself, and which was more than she felt
equal to support.
 
From their counsel, or their conversation, she knew she could receive
no assistance, their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress,
while her selfcommand would neither receive encouragement from their
example nor from their praise.  She was stronger alone, and her own
good sense so well supported her, that her firmness was as unshaken,
her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as with regrets so
poignant and so fresh, it was possible for them to be.
 
Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the
subject, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it and this for
more reasons than one.  She wanted to hear many particulars of their
engagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what
Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her
declaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted to
convince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and her
calmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested in
it than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntary
agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least
doubtful.  That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very
probable it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her
praise, not merely from Lucys assertion, but from her venturing to
trust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so
confessedly and evidently important.  And even Sir Johns joking
intelligence must have had some weight.  But indeed, while Elinor
remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by
Edward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it
natural that Lucy should be jealous and that she was so, her very
confidence was a proof.  What other reason for the disclosure of the
affair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of
Lucys superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in future?
She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rivals
intentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every
principle of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own affection
for Edward and to see him as little as possible she could not deny
herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart was
unwounded.  And as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on
the subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust her own
ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure.
 
But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be
commanded, though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take
advantage of any that occurred for the weather was not often fine
enough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might most
easily separate themselves from the others and though they met at
least every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly at
the former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of
conversation.  Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady
Middletons head and therefore very little leisure was ever given for
a general chat, and none at all for particular discourse.  They met for
the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards,
or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.
 
One or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affording
Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called at
the cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that they
would all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged to
attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite alone,
except her mother and the two Miss Steeles.  Elinor, who foresaw a
fairer opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as this
was likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil
and wellbred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united
them together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the
invitation Margaret, with her mothers permission, was equally
compliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of their
parties, was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her
seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.
 
The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from
the frightful solitude which had threatened her.  The insipidity of the
meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected it produced not one
novelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less interesting
than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and
drawing room to the latter, the children accompanied them, and while
they remained there, she was too well convinced of the impossibility of
engaging Lucys attention to attempt it.  They quitted it only with the
removal of the teathings.  The cardtable was then placed, and Elinor
began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of
finding time for conversation at the park.  They all rose up in
preparation for a round game.
 
"I am glad," said Lady Middleton to Lucy, "you are not going to finish
poor little Annamarias basket this evening for I am sure it must hurt
your eyes to work filigree by candlelight.  And we will make the dear
little love some amends for her disappointment tomorrow, and then I
hope she will not much mind it."
 
This hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied,
"Indeed you are very much mistaken, Lady Middleton I am only waiting
to know whether you can make your party without me, or I should have
been at my filigree already.  I would not disappoint the little angel
for all the world and if you want me at the cardtable now, I am
resolved to finish the basket after supper."
 
"You are very good, I hope it wont hurt your eyeswill you ring the
bell for some working candles?  My poor little girl would be sadly
disappointed, I know, if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for
though I told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends upon
having it done."
 
Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an
alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no
greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child.
 
Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others.  No one made
any objection but Marianne, who with her usual inattention to the forms
of general civility, exclaimed, "Your Ladyship will have the goodness
to excuse MEyou know I detest cards.  I shall go to the pianoforte
I have not touched it since it was tuned."  And without farther
ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.
 
Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that SHE had never made
so rude a speech.
 
"Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know, maam,"
said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth away the offence "and I do not
much wonder at it for it is the very best toned pianoforte I ever
heard."
 
The remaining five were now to draw their cards.
 
"Perhaps," continued Elinor, "if I should happen to cut out, I may be
of some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her papers for her and
there is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must be
impossible I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening.  I
should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow me a share in it."
 
"Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help," cried Lucy,
"for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was
and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after
all."
 
"Oh! that would be terrible, indeed," said Miss Steele "Dear little
soul, how I do love her!"
 
"You are very kind," said Lady Middleton to Elinor "and as you really
like the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till
another rubber, or will you take your chance now?"
 
Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals, and thus by a
little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to
practise, gained her own end, and pleased Lady Middleton at the same
time.  Lucy made room for her with ready attention, and the two fair
rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the
utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work.  The pianoforte at
which Marianne, wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts, had
by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself,
was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might
safely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting
subject, without any risk of being heard at the cardtable.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 24
 
 
In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.
 
"I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with,
if I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on its
subject.  I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again."
 
"Thank you," cried Lucy warmly, "for breaking the ice you have set my
heart at ease by it for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended
you by what I told you that Monday."
 
"Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me," and Elinor spoke
it with the truest sincerity, "nothing could be farther from my
intention than to give you such an idea.  Could you have a motive for
the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?"
 
"And yet I do assure you," replied Lucy, her little sharp eyes full of
meaning, "there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your
manner that made me quite uncomfortable.  I felt sure that you was
angry with me and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for
having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs.  But I am
very glad to find it was only my own fancy, and that you really do not
blame me.  If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my
heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of
my life, your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am
sure."
 
"Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you,
to acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shall
never have reason to repent it.  Your case is a very unfortunate one
you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have
need of all your mutual affection to support you under them.  Mr.
Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother."
 
"He has only two thousand pounds of his own it would be madness to
marry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every prospect
of more without a sigh.  I have been always used to a very small
income, and could struggle with any poverty for him but I love him too
well to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that his
mother might give him if he married to please her.  We must wait, it
may be for many years.  With almost every other man in the world, it
would be an alarming prospect but Edwards affection and constancy
nothing can deprive me of I know."
 
"That conviction must be every thing to you and he is undoubtedly
supported by the same trust in yours.  If the strength of your
reciprocal attachment had failed, as between many people, and under
many circumstances it naturally would during a four years engagement,
your situation would have been pitiable, indeed."
 
Lucy here looked up but Elinor was careful in guarding her countenance
from every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency.
 
"Edwards love for me," said Lucy, "has been pretty well put to the
test, by our long, very long absence since we were first engaged, and
it has stood the trial so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt
it now.  I can safely say that he has never gave me one moments alarm
on that account from the first."
 
Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion.
 
Lucy went on.  "I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature, and from
our different situations in life, from his being so much more in the
world than me, and our continual separation, I was enough inclined for
suspicion, to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had been
the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met, or any
lowness of spirits that I could not account for, or if he had talked
more of one lady than another, or seemed in any respect less happy at
Longstaple than he used to be.  I do not mean to say that I am
particularly observant or quicksighted in general, but in such a case
I am sure I could not be deceived."
 
"All this," thought Elinor, "is very pretty but it can impose upon
neither of us."
 
"But what," said she after a short silence, "are your views? or have
you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrarss death, which is a
melancholy and shocking extremity?Is her son determined to submit to
this, and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which
it may involve you, rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a
while by owning the truth?"
 
"If we could be certain that it would be only for a while!  But Mrs.
Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman, and in her first fit of anger
upon hearing it, would very likely secure every thing to Robert, and
the idea of that, for Edwards sake, frightens away all my inclination
for hasty measures."
 
"And for your own sake too, or you are carrying your disinterestedness
beyond reason."
 
Lucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent.
 
"Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?" asked Elinor.
 
"Not at allI never saw him but I fancy he is very unlike his
brothersilly and a great coxcomb."
 
"A great coxcomb!" repeated Miss Steele, whose ear had caught those
words by a sudden pause in Mariannes music. "Oh, they are talking of
their favourite beaux, I dare say."
 
"No sister," cried Lucy, "you are mistaken there, our favourite beaux
are NOT great coxcombs."
 
"I can answer for it that Miss Dashwoods is not," said Mrs. Jennings,
laughing heartily "for he is one of the modestest, prettiest behaved
young men I ever saw but as for Lucy, she is such a sly little
creature, there is no finding out who SHE likes."
 
"Oh," cried Miss Steele, looking significantly round at them, "I dare
say Lucys beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss
Dashwoods."
 
Elinor blushed in spite of herself.  Lucy bit her lip, and looked
angrily at her sister.  A mutual silence took place for some time.
Lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone, though Marianne
was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent
concerto
 
"I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my
head, for bringing matters to bear indeed I am bound to let you into
the secret, for you are a party concerned.  I dare say you have seen
enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other
profession now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he
can, and then through your interest, which I am sure you would be kind
enough to use out of friendship for him, and I hope out of some regard
to me, your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living
which I understand is a very good one, and the present incumbent not
likely to live a great while.  That would be enough for us to marry
upon, and we might trust to time and chance for the rest."
 
"I should always be happy," replied Elinor, "to show any mark of my
esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars but do you not perceive that my
interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary?  He is
brother to Mrs. John DashwoodTHAT must be recommendation enough to
her husband."
 
"But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edwards going into
orders."
 
"Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little."
 
They were again silent for many minutes.  At length Lucy exclaimed with
a deep sigh,
 
"I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at
once by dissolving the engagement.  We seem so beset with difficulties
on every side, that though it would make us miserable for a time, we
should be happier perhaps in the end.  But you will not give me your
advice, Miss Dashwood?"
 
"No," answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed very agitated
feelings, "on such a subject I certainly will not.  You know very well
that my opinion would have no weight with you, unless it were on the
side of your wishes."
 
"Indeed you wrong me," replied Lucy, with great solemnity "I know
nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours and I do
really believe, that if you was to say to me, I advise you by all
means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars, it will be
more for the happiness of both of you, I should resolve upon doing it
immediately."
 
Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edwards future wife, and
replied, "This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any
opinion on the subject had I formed one.  It raises my influence much
too high the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too
much for an indifferent person."
 
"Tis because you are an indifferent person," said Lucy, with some
pique, and laying a particular stress on those words, "that your
judgment might justly have such weight with me.  If you could be
supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings, your opinion
would not be worth having."
 
Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this, lest they might
provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve and
was even partly determined never to mention the subject again.  Another
pause therefore of many minutes duration, succeeded this speech, and
Lucy was still the first to end it.
 
"Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?" said she with all
her accustomary complacency.
 
"Certainly not."
 
"I am sorry for that," returned the other, while her eyes brightened at
the information, "it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you
there!  But I dare say you will go for all that.  To be sure, your
brother and sister will ask you to come to them."
 
"It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do."
 
"How unlucky that is! I had quite depended upon meeting you there.
Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who
have been wanting us to visit them these several years!  But I only go
for the sake of seeing Edward.  He will be there in February, otherwise
London would have no charms for me I have not spirits for it."
 
Elinor was soon called to the cardtable by the conclusion of the first
rubber, and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore
at an end, to which both of them submitted without any reluctance, for
nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other
less than they had done before and Elinor sat down to the card table
with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without
affection for the person who was to be his wife but that he had not
even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage, which sincere
affection on HER side would have given, for selfinterest alone could
induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement, of which she seemed so
thoroughly aware that he was weary.
 
From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor, and when
entered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it,
and was particularly careful to inform her confidante, of her happiness
whenever she received a letter from Edward, it was treated by the
former with calmness and caution, and dismissed as soon as civility
would allow for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which
Lucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to herself.
 
The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyond
what the first invitation implied.  Their favour increased they could
not be spared Sir John would not hear of their going and in spite of
their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter, in spite of the
absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately, which was
in full force at the end of every week, they were prevailed on to stay
nearly two months at the park, and to assist in the due celebration of
that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private
balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 25
 
 
Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of
the year at the houses of her children and friends, she was not without
a settled habitation of her own.  Since the death of her husband, who
had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town, she had
resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman
Square.  Towards this home, she began on the approach of January to
turn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly, and very
unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany her.
Elinor, without observing the varying complexion of her sister, and the
animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave
a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she believed herself
to be speaking their united inclinations.  The reason alleged was their
determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the
year.  Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise, and
repeated her invitation immediately.
 
"Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I DO beg
you will favour me with your company, for Ive quite set my heart upon
it.  Dont fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me, for I shant
put myself at all out of my way for you.  It will only be sending Betty
by the coach, and I hope I can afford THAT.  We three shall be able to
go very well in my chaise and when we are in town, if you do not like
to go wherever I do, well and good, you may always go with one of my
daughters.  I am sure your mother will not object to it for I have had
such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will
think me a very fit person to have the charge of you and if I dont
get one of you at least well married before I have done with you, it
shall not be my fault.  I shall speak a good word for you to all the
young men, you may depend upon it."
 
"I have a notion," said Sir John, "that Miss Marianne would not object
to such a scheme, if her elder sister would come into it.  It is very
hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure, because Miss
Dashwood does not wish it.  So I would advise you two, to set off for
town, when you are tired of Barton, without saying a word to Miss
Dashwood about it."
 
"Nay," cried Mrs. Jennings, "I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of
Miss Mariannes company, whether Miss Dashwood will go or not, only the
more the merrier say I, and I thought it would be more comfortable for
them to be together because, if they got tired of me, they might talk
to one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back.  But one or
the other, if not both of them, I must have.  Lord bless me! how do you
think I can live poking by myself, I who have been always used till
this winter to have Charlotte with me.  Come, Miss Marianne, let us
strike hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change her
mind by and bye, why so much the better."
 
"I thank you, maam, sincerely thank you," said Marianne, with warmth
"your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would give
me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of,
to be able to accept it.  But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,I
feel the justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be made
less happy, less comfortable by our absenceOh! no, nothing should
tempt me to leave her.  It should not, must not be a struggle."
 
Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare
them perfectly well and Elinor, who now understood her sister, and saw
to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her
eagerness to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct
opposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her mothers
decision, from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any
support in her endeavour to prevent a visit, which she could not
approve of for Marianne, and which on her own account she had
particular reasons to avoid.  Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her
mother would be eager to promoteshe could not expect to influence the
latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had
never been able to inspire her with distrust and she dared not explain
the motive of her own disinclination for going to London.  That
Marianne, fastidious as she was, thoroughly acquainted with Mrs.
Jennings manners, and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook
every inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever must be
most wounding to her irritable feelings, in her pursuit of one object,
was such a proof, so strong, so full, of the importance of that object
to her, as Elinor, in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared to
witness.
 
On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, persuaded that such
an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her
daughters, and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to
herself, how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear of
their declining the offer upon HER account insisted on their both
accepting it directly and then began to foresee, with her usual
cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all,
from this separation.
 
"I am delighted with the plan," she cried, "it is exactly what I could
wish.  Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves.
When you and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly and
happily together with our books and our music! You will find Margaret
so improved when you come back again!  I have a little plan of
alteration for your bedrooms too, which may now be performed without
any inconvenience to any one.  It is very right that you SHOULD go to
town I would have every young woman of your condition in life
acquainted with the manners and amusements of London.  You will be
under the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness to
you I can have no doubt.  And in all probability you will see your
brother, and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife,
when I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so wholly
estranged from each other."
 
"Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness," said Elinor, "you
have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which
occurred to you, there is still one objection which, in my opinion,
cannot be so easily removed."
 
Mariannes countenance sunk.
 
"And what," said Mrs. Dashwood, "is my dear prudent Elinor going to
suggest?  What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward?  Do let
me hear a word about the expense of it."
 
"My objection is this though I think very well of Mrs. Jenningss
heart, she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure, or
whose protection will give us consequence."
 
"That is very true," replied her mother, "but of her society,
separately from that of other people, you will scarcely have any thing
at all, and you will almost always appear in public with Lady
Middleton."
 
"If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings," said
Marianne, "at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation.  I
have no such scruples, and I am sure I could put up with every
unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort."
 
Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards
the manners of a person, to whom she had often had difficulty in
persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness and resolved
within herself, that if her sister persisted in going, she would go
likewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left
to the sole guidance of her own judgment, or that Mrs. Jennings should
be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her
domestic hours.  To this determination she was the more easily
reconciled, by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucys account, was
not to be in town before February and that their visit, without any
unreasonable abridgement, might be previously finished.
 
"I will have you BOTH go," said Mrs. Dashwood "these objections are
nonsensical.  You will have much pleasure in being in London, and
especially in being together and if Elinor would ever condescend to
anticipate enjoyment, she would foresee it there from a variety of
sources she would, perhaps, expect some from improving her
acquaintance with her sisterinlaws family."
 
Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her
mothers dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself, that the
shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now on this
attack, though almost hopeless of success, she forced herself to begin
her design by saying, as calmly as she could, "I like Edward Ferrars
very much, and shall always be glad to see him but as to the rest of
the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference to me, whether I am
ever known to them or not."
 
Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing.  Marianne lifted up her eyes in
astonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held
her tongue.
 
After very little farther discourse, it was finally settled that the
invitation should be fully accepted.  Mrs. Jennings received the
information with a great deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness
and care nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her.  Sir John was
delighted for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of
being alone, the acquisition of two, to the number of inhabitants in
London, was something.  Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being
delighted, which was putting herself rather out of her way and as for
the Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had never been so happy in
their lives as this intelligence made them.
 
Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with
less reluctance than she had expected to feel.  With regard to herself,
it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not, and
when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan, and her
sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner, restored to all
her usual animation, and elevated to more than her usual gaiety, she
could not be dissatisfied with the cause, and would hardly allow
herself to distrust the consequence.
 
Mariannes joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was the
perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone.  Her
unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness
and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive.
Her mothers affliction was hardly less, and Elinor was the only one of
the three, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of
eternal.
 
Their departure took place in the first week in January.  The
Middletons were to follow in about a week.  The Miss Steeles kept their
station at the park, and were to quit it only with the rest of the
family.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 26
 
 
Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, and
beginning a journey to London under her protection, and as her guest,
without wondering at her own situation, so short had their acquaintance
with that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age and
disposition, and so many had been her objections against such a measure
only a few days before! But these objections had all, with that happy
ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared, been
overcome or overlooked and Elinor, in spite of every occasional doubt
of Willoughbys constancy, could not witness the rapture of delightful
expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of
Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect, how cheerless
her own state of mind in the comparison, and how gladly she would
engage in the solicitude of Mariannes situation to have the same
animating object in view, the same possibility of hope.  A short, a
very short time however must now decide what Willoughbys intentions
were in all probability he was already in town.  Mariannes eagerness
to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there and Elinor was
resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character
which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her,
but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such
zealous attention, as to ascertain what he was and what he meant,
before many meetings had taken place.  Should the result of her
observations be unfavourable, she was determined at all events to open
the eyes of her sister should it be otherwise, her exertions would be
of a different natureshe must then learn to avoid every selfish
comparison, and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction
in the happiness of Marianne.
 
They were three days on their journey, and Mariannes behaviour as they
travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and
companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be.  She sat in
silence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely
ever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque beauty
within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively
addressed to her sister.  To atone for this conduct therefore, Elinor
took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had
assigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings,
talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her whenever she
could and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both with all
possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and
enjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their
own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their preferring
salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets.  They reached town by
three oclock the third day, glad to be released, after such a journey,
from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury
of a good fire.
 
The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young ladies
were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment.  It
had formerly been Charlottes, and over the mantelpiece still hung a
landscape in coloured silks of her performance, in proof of her having
spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect.
 
As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their
arrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her
mother, and sat down for that purpose.  In a few moments Marianne did
the same.  "I am writing home, Marianne," said Elinor "had not you
better defer your letter for a day or two?"
 
"I am NOT going to write to my mother," replied Marianne, hastily, and
as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry.  Elinor said no more it
immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby and
the conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however
mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be
engaged.  This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her
pleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.
Mariannes was finished in a very few minutes in length it could be no
more than a note it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with
eager rapidity.  Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the
direction and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the
bell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed
for her to the twopenny post.  This decided the matter at once.
 
Her spirits still continued very high but there was a flutter in them
which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister, and this
agitation increased as the evening drew on.  She could scarcely eat any
dinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemed
anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.
 
It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being much
engaged in her own room, could see little of what was passing.  The tea
things were brought in, and already had Marianne been disappointed more
than once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly
heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house, Elinor
felt secure of its announcing Willoughbys approach, and Marianne,
starting up, moved towards the door.  Every thing was silent this
could not be borne many seconds she opened the door, advanced a few
steps towards the stairs, and after listening half a minute, returned
into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard
him would naturally produce in the ecstasy of her feelings at that
instant she could not help exclaiming, "Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby,
indeed it is!" and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms,
when Colonel Brandon appeared.
 
It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she immediately
left the room.  Elinor was disappointed too but at the same time her
regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her and she felt
particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive
that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing
him.  She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him, that he even
observed Marianne as she quitted the room, with such astonishment and
concern, as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded
towards herself.
 
"Is your sister ill?" said he.
 
Elinor answered in some distress that she was, and then talked of
headaches, low spirits, and over fatigues and of every thing to which
she could decently attribute her sisters behaviour.
 
He heard her with the most earnest attention, but seeming to recollect
himself, said no more on the subject, and began directly to speak of
his pleasure at seeing them in London, making the usual inquiries about
their journey, and the friends they had left behind.
 
In this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side,
they continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughts
of both engaged elsewhere.  Elinor wished very much to ask whether
Willoughby were then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain by
any enquiry after his rival and at length, by way of saying something,
she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last.
"Yes," he replied, with some embarrassment, "almost ever since I have
been once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never been in
my power to return to Barton."
 
This, and the manner in which it was said, immediately brought back to
her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place, with
the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings, and she
was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the
subject than she had ever felt.
 
Mrs. Jennings soon came in.  "Oh! Colonel," said she, with her usual
noisy cheerfulness, "I am monstrous glad to see yousorry I could not
come beforebeg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me a
little, and settle my matters for it is a long while since I have been
at home, and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do
after one has been away for any time and then I have had Cartwright to
settle with Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner!
But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should be in town
today?"
 
"I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmers, where I have been
dining."
 
"Oh, you did well, and how do they all do at their house?  How does
Charlotte do?  I warrant you she is a fine size by this time."
 
"Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned to tell you,
that you will certainly see her tomorrow."
 
"Ay, to be sure, I thought as much.  Well, Colonel, I have brought two
young ladies with me, you seethat is, you see but one of them now,
but there is another somewhere.  Your friend, Miss Marianne, toowhich
you will not be sorry to hear.  I do not know what you and Mr.
Willoughby will do between you about her.  Ay, it is a fine thing to be
young and handsome.  Well! I was young once, but I never was very
handsomeworse luck for me.  However, I got a very good husband, and I
dont know what the greatest beauty can do more.  Ah! poor man! he has
been dead these eight years and better.  But Colonel, where have you
been to since we parted?  And how does your business go on?  Come,
come, lets have no secrets among friends."
 
He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries, but
without satisfying her in any.  Elinor now began to make the tea, and
Marianne was obliged to appear again.
 
After her entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent
than he had been before, and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to
stay long.  No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies were
unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.
 
Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks.
The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the
expectation of what was to happen that day.  They had not long finished
their breakfast before Mrs. Palmers barouche stopped at the door, and
in a few minutes she came laughing into the room so delighted to see
them all, that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure
from meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again.  So surprised at
their coming to town, though it was what she had rather expected all
along so angry at their accepting her mothers invitation after having
declined her own, though at the same time she would never have forgiven
them if they had not come!
 
"Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you," said she "What do you think
he said when he heard of your coming with Mama?  I forget what it was
now, but it was something so droll!"
 
After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat,
or in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all their
acquaintance on Mrs. Jenningss side, and in laughter without cause on
Mrs. Palmers, it was proposed by the latter that they should all
accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning, to
which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented, as having likewise
some purchases to make themselves and Marianne, though declining it at
first was induced to go likewise.
 
Wherever they went, she was evidently always on the watch.  In Bond
Street especially, where much of their business lay, her eyes were in
constant inquiry and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mind
was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them, from all
that interested and occupied the others.  Restless and dissatisfied
every where, her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article
of purchase, however it might equally concern them both she received
no pleasure from anything was only impatient to be at home again, and
could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of Mrs.
Palmer, whose eye was caught by every thing pretty, expensive, or new
who was wild to buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away her
time in rapture and indecision.
 
It was late in the morning before they returned home and no sooner had
they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and when
Elinor followed, she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful
countenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been there.
 
"Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?" said she to
the footman who then entered with the parcels.  She was answered in the
negative.  "Are you quite sure of it?" she replied.  "Are you certain
that no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?"
 
The man replied that none had.
 
"How very odd!" said she, in a low and disappointed voice, as she
turned away to the window.
 
"How odd, indeed!" repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her sister
with uneasiness.  "If she had not known him to be in town she would not
have written to him, as she did she would have written to Combe Magna
and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither come nor write!
Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an engagement
between a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be carried on in
so doubtful, so mysterious a manner!  I long to inquire and how will
MY interference be borne."
 
She determined, after some consideration, that if appearances continued
many days longer as unpleasant as they now were, she would represent in
the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some serious
enquiry into the affair.
 
Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jenningss intimate
acquaintance, whom she had met and invited in the morning, dined with
them.  The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening
engagements and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table
for the others.  Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as she
would never learn the game but though her time was therefore at her
own disposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure
to her than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety of
expectation and the pain of disappointment.  She sometimes endeavoured
for a few minutes to read but the book was soon thrown aside, and she
returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and
forwards across the room, pausing for a moment whenever she came to the
window, in hopes of distinguishing the longexpected rap.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 27
 
 
"If this open weather holds much longer," said Mrs. Jennings, when they
met at breakfast the following morning, "Sir John will not like leaving
Barton next week tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a days
pleasure.  Poor souls!  I always pity them when they do they seem to
take it so much to heart."
 
"That is true," cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice, and walking to the
window as she spoke, to examine the day.  "I had not thought of that.
This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country."
 
It was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were restored by it.
"It is charming weather for THEM indeed," she continued, as she sat
down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance.  "How much they
must enjoy it! But" with a little return of anxiety "it cannot be
expected to last long.  At this time of the year, and after such a
series of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it.  Frosts
will soon set in, and in all probability with severity.  In another day
or two perhaps this extreme mildness can hardly last longernay,
perhaps it may freeze tonight!"
 
"At any rate," said Elinor, wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from
seeing her sisters thoughts as clearly as she did, "I dare say we
shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week."
 
"Ay, my dear, Ill warrant you we do.  Mary always has her own way."
 
"And now," silently conjectured Elinor, "she will write to Combe by
this days post."
 
But if she DID, the letter was written and sent away with a privacy
which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact.  Whatever the
truth of it might be, and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough
contentment about it, yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could
not be very uncomfortable herself.  And Marianne was in spirits happy
in the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her expectation of
a frost.
 
The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs.
Jenningss acquaintance to inform them of her being in town and
Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind,
watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the
air.
 
"Dont you find it colder than it was in the morning, Elinor? There
seems to me a very decided difference.  I can hardly keep my hands warm
even in my muff.  It was not so yesterday, I think.  The clouds seem
parting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a clear
afternoon."
 
Elinor was alternately diverted and pained but Marianne persevered,
and saw every night in the brightness of the fire, and every morning in
the appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching
frost.
 
The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs.
Jenningss style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with her
behaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind.  Every thing in her
household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan, and
excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middletons regret, she
had never dropped, she visited no one to whom an introduction could at
all discompose the feelings of her young companions.  Pleased to find
herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had
expected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real
enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home or
abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.
 
Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation to the house, was with
them almost every day he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor,
who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from
any other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time with much
concern his continued regard for her sister.  She feared it was a
strengthening regard.  It grieved her to see the earnestness with which
he often watched Marianne, and his spirits were certainly worse than
when at Barton.
 
About a week after their arrival, it became certain that Willoughby was
also arrived.  His card was on the table when they came in from the
mornings drive.
 
"Good God!" cried Marianne, "he has been here while we were out."
Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his being in London, now ventured to
say, "Depend upon it, he will call again tomorrow."  But Marianne
seemed hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jenningss entrance, escaped with
the precious card.
 
This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor, restored to those of
her sister all, and more than all, their former agitation.  From this
moment her mind was never quiet the expectation of seeing him every
hour of the day, made her unfit for any thing.  She insisted on being
left behind, the next morning, when the others went out.
 
Elinors thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street
during their absence but a moments glance at her sister when they
returned was enough to inform her, that Willoughby had paid no second
visit there.  A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table.
 
"For me!" cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.
 
"No, maam, for my mistress."
 
But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.
 
"It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings how provoking!"
 
"You are expecting a letter, then?" said Elinor, unable to be longer
silent.
 
"Yes, a littlenot much."
 
After a short pause.  "You have no confidence in me, Marianne."
 
"Nay, Elinor, this reproach from YOUyou who have confidence in no
one!"
 
"Me!" returned Elinor in some confusion "indeed, Marianne, I have
nothing to tell."
 
"Nor I," answered Marianne with energy, "our situations then are alike.
We have neither of us any thing to tell you, because you do not
communicate, and I, because I conceal nothing."
 
Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself, which she was
not at liberty to do away, knew not how, under such circumstances, to
press for greater openness in Marianne.
 
Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her, she read it
aloud.  It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in Conduit
Street the night before, and requesting the company of her mother and
cousins the following evening.  Business on Sir Johns part, and a
violent cold on her own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street.
The invitation was accepted but when the hour of appointment drew
near, necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that
they should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some difficulty
in persuading her sister to go, for still she had seen nothing of
Willoughby and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad,
than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence.
 
Elinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is not
materially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settled
in town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty
young people, and to amuse them with a ball.  This was an affair,
however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve.  In the country, an
unpremeditated dance was very allowable but in London, where the
reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, it
was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have it
known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine
couple, with two violins, and a mere sideboard collation.
 
Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party from the former, whom they had
not seen before since their arrival in town, as he was careful to avoid
the appearance of any attention to his motherinlaw, and therefore
never came near her, they received no mark of recognition on their
entrance.  He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know who they
were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of the
room.  Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered it
was enoughHE was not thereand she sat down, equally illdisposed to
receive or communicate pleasure.  After they had been assembled about
an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his
surprise on seeing them in town, though Colonel Brandon had been first
informed of their arrival at his house, and he had himself said
something very droll on hearing that they were to come.
 
"I thought you were both in Devonshire," said he.
 
"Did you?" replied Elinor.
 
"When do you go back again?"
 
"I do not know." And thus ended their discourse.
 
Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life, as she was
that evening, and never so much fatigued by the exercise.  She
complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street.
 
"Aye, aye," said Mrs. Jennings, "we know the reason of all that very
well if a certain person who shall be nameless, had been there, you
would not have been a bit tired and to say the truth it was not very
pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited."
 
"Invited!" cried Marianne.
 
"So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir John met him
somewhere in the street this morning." Marianne said no more, but
looked exceedingly hurt.  Impatient in this situation to be doing
something that might lead to her sisters relief, Elinor resolved to
write the next morning to her mother, and hoped by awakening her fears
for the health of Marianne, to procure those inquiries which had been
so long delayed and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by
perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne was again
writing to Willoughby, for she could not suppose it to be to any other
person.
 
About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on
business, and Elinor began her letter directly, while Marianne, too
restless for employment, too anxious for conversation, walked from one
window to the other, or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.
Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother, relating all
that had passed, her suspicions of Willoughbys inconstancy, urging her
by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account
of her real situation with respect to him.
 
Her letter was scarcely finished, when a rap foretold a visitor, and
Colonel Brandon was announced.  Marianne, who had seen him from the
window, and who hated company of any kind, left the room before he
entered it.  He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing
satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he had somewhat in
particular to tell her, sat for some time without saying a word.
Elinor, persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her
sister was concerned, impatiently expected its opening.  It was not the
first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction for, more than
once before, beginning with the observation of "your sister looks
unwell today," or "your sister seems out of spirits," he had appeared
on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring, something
particular about her.  After a pause of several minutes, their silence
was broken, by his asking her in a voice of some agitation, when he was
to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother?  Elinor was not
prepared for such a question, and having no answer ready, was obliged
to adopt the simple and common expedient, of asking what he meant?  He
tried to smile as he replied, "your sisters engagement to Mr.
Willoughby is very generally known."
 
"It cannot be generally known," returned Elinor, "for her own family do
not know it."
 
He looked surprised and said, "I beg your pardon, I am afraid my
inquiry has been impertinent but I had not supposed any secrecy
intended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universally
talked of."
 
"How can that be? By whom can you have heard it mentioned?"
 
"By manyby some of whom you know nothing, by others with whom you are
most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons.  But
still I might not have believed it, for where the mind is perhaps
rather unwilling to be convinced, it will always find something to
support its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,
accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby in
your sisters writing.  I came to inquire, but I was convinced before I
could ask the question.  Is every thing finally settled?  Is it
impossible to?  But I have no right, and I could have no chance of
succeeding.  Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.  I believe I have been wrong in
saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence I
have the strongest dependence.  Tell me that it is all absolutely
resolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, if
concealment be possible, is all that remains."
 
These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for
her sister, affected her very much.  She was not immediately able to
say anything, and even when her spirits were recovered, she debated for
a short time, on the answer it would be most proper to give.  The real
state of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little known
to herself, that in endeavouring to explain it, she might be as liable
to say too much as too little.  Yet as she was convinced that
Mariannes affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel
Brandons success, whatever the event of that affection might be, and
at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure, she thought
it most prudent and kind, after some consideration, to say more than
she really knew or believed.  She acknowledged, therefore, that though
she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they
stood with each other, of their mutual affection she had no doubt, and
of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear.
 
He listened to her with silent attention, and on her ceasing to speak,
rose directly from his seat, and after saying in a voice of emotion,
"to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness to Willoughby that he
may endeavour to deserve her,"took leave, and went away.
 
Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation, to
lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points she was left, on the
contrary, with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandons
unhappiness, and was prevented even from wishing it removed, by her
anxiety for the very event that must confirm it.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 28
 
 
Nothing occurred during the next three or four days, to make Elinor
regret what she had done, in applying to her mother for Willoughby
neither came nor wrote.  They were engaged about the end of that time
to attend Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was kept
away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter and for this party,
Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her appearance, and seeming
equally indifferent whether she went or staid, prepared, without one
look of hope or one expression of pleasure.  She sat by the
drawingroom fire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middletons
arrival, without once stirring from her seat, or altering her attitude,
lost in her own thoughts, and insensible of her sisters presence and
when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the
door, she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected.
 
They arrived in due time at the place of destination, and as soon as
the string of carriages before them would allow, alighted, ascended the
stairs, heard their names announced from one landingplace to another
in an audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up, quite full
of company, and insufferably hot.  When they had paid their tribute of
politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house, they were permitted
to mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat and
inconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add.  After some
time spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down to
Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she and
Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great
distance from the table.
 
They had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor perceived
Willoughby, standing within a few yards of them, in earnest
conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman.  She soon
caught his eye, and he immediately bowed, but without attempting to
speak to her, or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see her
and then continued his discourse with the same lady.  Elinor turned
involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be unobserved by
her.  At that moment she first perceived him, and her whole countenance
glowing with sudden delight, she would have moved towards him
instantly, had not her sister caught hold of her.
 
"Good heavens!" she exclaimed, "he is therehe is thereOh! why does
he not look at me? why cannot I speak to him?"
 
"Pray, pray be composed," cried Elinor, "and do not betray what you
feel to every body present.  Perhaps he has not observed you yet."
 
This however was more than she could believe herself and to be
composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne, it
was beyond her wish.  She sat in an agony of impatience which affected
every feature.
 
At last he turned round again, and regarded them both she started up,
and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection, held out her hand to
him.  He approached, and addressing himself rather to Elinor than
Marianne, as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to observe
her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs. Dashwood, and
asked how long they had been in town.  Elinor was robbed of all
presence of mind by such an address, and was unable to say a word.  But
the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed.  Her face was
crimsoned over, and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion,
"Good God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this?  Have you not
received my letters?  Will you not shake hands with me?"
 
He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed painful to him, and he
held her hand only for a moment.  During all this time he was evidently
struggling for composure.  Elinor watched his countenance and saw its
expression becoming more tranquil.  After a moments pause, he spoke
with calmness.
 
"I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday,
and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find
yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home.  My card was not lost, I hope."
 
"But have you not received my notes?" cried Marianne in the wildest
anxiety.  "Here is some mistake I am suresome dreadful mistake.  What
can be the meaning of it?  Tell me, Willoughby for heavens sake tell
me, what is the matter?"
 
He made no reply his complexion changed and all his embarrassment
returned but as if, on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he
had been previously talking, he felt the necessity of instant exertion,
he recovered himself again, and after saying, "Yes, I had the pleasure
of receiving the information of your arrival in town, which you were so
good as to send me," turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined
his friend.
 
Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk into
her chair, and Elinor, expecting every moment to see her faint, tried
to screen her from the observation of others, while reviving her with
lavender water.
 
"Go to him, Elinor," she cried, as soon as she could speak, "and force
him to come to me.  Tell him I must see him againmust speak to him
instantly. I cannot restI shall not have a moments peace till this
is explainedsome dreadful misapprehension or other. Oh go to him
this moment."
 
"How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne, you must wait.  This is
not the place for explanations.  Wait only till tomorrow."
 
With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him
herself and to persuade her to check her agitation, to wait, at least,
with the appearance of composure, till she might speak to him with more
privacy and more effect, was impossible for Marianne continued
incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings,
by exclamations of wretchedness.  In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby
quit the room by the door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne
that he was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that
evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm.  She instantly begged
her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home, as she was
too miserable to stay a minute longer.
 
Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber, on being informed
that Marianne was unwell, was too polite to object for a moment to her
wish of going away, and making over her cards to a friend, they
departed as soon the carriage could be found.  Scarcely a word was
spoken during their return to Berkeley Street.  Marianne was in a
silent agony, too much oppressed even for tears but as Mrs. Jennings
was luckily not come home, they could go directly to their own room,
where hartshorn restored her a little to herself.  She was soon
undressed and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone, her
sister then left her, and while she waited the return of Mrs. Jennings,
had leisure enough for thinking over the past.
 
That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and
Marianne she could not doubt, and that Willoughby was weary of it,
seemed equally clear for however Marianne might still feed her own
wishes, SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or
misapprehension of any kind.  Nothing but a thorough change of
sentiment could account for it.  Her indignation would have been still
stronger than it was, had she not witnessed that embarrassment which
seemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented
her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with
the affections of her sister from the first, without any design that
would bear investigation.  Absence might have weakened his regard, and
convenience might have determined him to overcome it, but that such a
regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt.
 
As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already
have given her, and on those still more severe which might await her in
its probable consequence, she could not reflect without the deepest
concern.  Her own situation gained in the comparison for while she
could ESTEEM Edward as much as ever, however they might be divided in
future, her mind might be always supported.  But every circumstance
that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery
of Marianne in a final separation from Willoughbyin an immediate and
irreconcilable rupture with him.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 29
 
 
Before the housemaid had lit their fire the next day, or the sun
gained any power over a cold, gloomy morning in January, Marianne, only
half dressed, was kneeling against one of the windowseats for the sake
of all the little light she could command from it, and writing as fast
as a continual flow of tears would permit her.  In this situation,
Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs, first perceived
her and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety,
said, in a tone of the most considerate gentleness,
 
"Marianne, may I ask?"
 
"No, Elinor," she replied, "ask nothing you will soon know all."
 
The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said, lasted no
longer than while she spoke, and was immediately followed by a return
of the same excessive affliction.  It was some minutes before she could
go on with her letter, and the frequent bursts of grief which still
obliged her, at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of
her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the
last time to Willoughby.
 
Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power and
she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more, had not
Marianne entreated her, with all the eagerness of the most nervous
irritability, not to speak to her for the world.  In such
circumstances, it was better for both that they should not be long
together and the restless state of Mariannes mind not only prevented
her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed, but
requiring at once solitude and continual change of place, made her
wander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding the sight of every
body.
 
At breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat any thing and
Elinors attention was then all employed, not in urging her, not in
pitying her, nor in appearing to regard her, but in endeavouring to
engage Mrs. Jenningss notice entirely to herself.
 
As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings, it lasted a
considerable time, and they were just setting themselves, after it,
round the common working table, when a letter was delivered to
Marianne, which she eagerly caught from the servant, and, turning of a
deathlike paleness, instantly ran out of the room.  Elinor, who saw as
plainly by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must come
from Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her
hardly able to hold up her head, and sat in such a general tremour as
made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jenningss notice.  That good
lady, however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter from
Willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke, and which she
treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh, that she would find it to
her liking.  Of Elinors distress, she was too busily employed in
measuring lengths of worsted for her rug, to see any thing at all and
calmly continuing her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she said,
 
"Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my
life!  MY girls were nothing to her, and yet they used to be foolish
enough but as for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature.  I
hope, from the bottom of my heart, he wont keep her waiting much
longer, for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn.
Pray, when are they to be married?"
 
Elinor, though never less disposed to speak than at that moment,
obliged herself to answer such an attack as this, and, therefore,
trying to smile, replied, "And have you really, Maam, talked yourself
into a persuasion of my sisters being engaged to Mr. Willoughby?  I
thought it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems to
imply more and I must beg, therefore, that you will not deceive
yourself any longer.  I do assure you that nothing would surprise me
more than to hear of their being going to be married."
 
"For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can you talk so?  Dont we
all know that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears in
love with each other from the first moment they met?  Did not I see
them together in Devonshire every day, and all day long and did not I
know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding
clothes?  Come, come, this wont do.  Because you are so sly about it
yourself, you think nobody else has any senses but it is no such
thing, I can tell you, for it has been known all over town this ever so
long.  I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte."
 
"Indeed, Maam," said Elinor, very seriously, "you are mistaken.
Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report, and
you will find that you have though you will not believe me now."
 
Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not spirits to say more,
and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written, hurried
away to their room, where, on opening the door, she saw Marianne
stretched on the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand,
and two or three others laying by her.  Elinor drew near, but without
saying a word and seating herself on the bed, took her hand, kissed
her affectionately several times, and then gave way to a burst of
tears, which at first was scarcely less violent than Mariannes. The
latter, though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness of
this behaviour, and after some time thus spent in joint affliction, she
put all the letters into Elinors hands and then covering her face
with her handkerchief, almost screamed with agony.  Elinor, who knew
that such grief, shocking as it was to witness it, must have its
course, watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent
itself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughbys letter, read as
follows
 
                              "Bond Street, January.
     "MY DEAR MADAM,
 
     "I have just had the honour of receiving your
     letter, for which I beg to return my sincere
     acknowledgments.  I am much concerned to find there
     was anything in my behaviour last night that did
     not meet your approbation and though I am quite at
     a loss to discover in what point I could be so
     unfortunate as to offend you, I entreat your
     forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been
     perfectly unintentional.  I shall never reflect on
     my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire
     without the most grateful pleasure, and flatter
     myself it will not be broken by any mistake or
     misapprehension of my actions.  My esteem for your
     whole family is very sincere but if I have been so
     unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than
     I felt, or meant to express, I shall reproach myself
     for not having been more guarded in my professions
     of that esteem.  That I should ever have meant more
     you will allow to be impossible, when you understand
     that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere,
     and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before
     this engagement is fulfilled.  It is with great
     regret that I obey your commands in returning the
     letters with which I have been honoured from you,
     and the lock of hair, which you so obligingly bestowed
     on me.
 
     "I am, dear Madam,
               "Your most obedient
                    "humble servant,
                                        "JOHN WILLOUGHBY."
 
 
With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss
Dashwood, may be imagined.  Though aware, before she began it, that it
must bring a confession of his inconstancy, and confirm their
separation for ever, she was not aware that such language could be
suffered to announce it nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable
of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and
delicate feelingso far from the common decorum of a gentleman, as to
send a letter so impudently cruel a letter which, instead of bringing
with his desire of a release any professions of regret, acknowledged no
breach of faith, denied all peculiar affection whatevera letter of
which every line was an insult, and which proclaimed its writer to be
deep in hardened villainy.
 
She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment then read
it again and again but every perusal only served to increase her
abhorrence of the man, and so bitter were her feelings against him,
that she dared not trust herself to speak, lest she might wound
Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement, not as a loss to
her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most
irremediable of all evils, a connection, for life, with an unprincipled
man, as a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most important.
 
In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter, on the
depravity of that mind which could dictate it, and probably, on the
very different mind of a very different person, who had no other
connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with
every thing that passed, Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her
sister, forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread, and so
entirely forgot how long she had been in the room, that when on hearing
a carriage drive up to the door, she went to the window to see who
could be coming so unreasonably early, she was all astonishment to
perceive Mrs. Jenningss chariot, which she knew had not been ordered
till one.  Determined not to quit Marianne, though hopeless of
contributing, at present, to her ease, she hurried away to excuse
herself from attending Mrs. Jennings, on account of her sister being
indisposed.  Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly goodhumoured concern for
its cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor, after seeing
her safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she found attempting to rise
from the bed, and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from
falling on the floor, faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest
and food for it was many days since she had any appetite, and many
nights since she had really slept and now, when her mind was no longer
supported by the fever of suspense, the consequence of all this was
felt in an aching head, a weakened stomach, and a general nervous
faintness.  A glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her directly,
made her more comfortable, and she was at last able to express some
sense of her kindness, by saying,
 
"Poor Elinor! how unhappy I make you!"
 
"I only wish," replied her sister, "there were any thing I COULD do,
which might be of comfort to you."
 
This, as every thing else would have been, was too much for Marianne,
who could only exclaim, in the anguish of her heart, "Oh! Elinor, I am
miserable, indeed," before her voice was entirely lost in sobs.
 
Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in
silence.
 
"Exert yourself, dear Marianne," she cried, "if you would not kill
yourself and all who love you.  Think of your mother think of her
misery while YOU suffer for her sake you must exert yourself."
 
"I cannot, I cannot," cried Marianne "leave me, leave me, if I
distress you leave me, hate me, forget me!  but do not torture me so.
Oh! how easy for those, who have no sorrow of their own to talk of
exertion!  Happy, happy Elinor, YOU cannot have an idea of what I
suffer."
 
"Do you call ME happy, Marianne?  Ah! if you knew!And can you believe
me to be so, while I see you so wretched!"
 
"Forgive me, forgive me," throwing her arms round her sisters neck "I
know you feel for me I know what a heart you have but yet you
areyou must be happy Edward loves youwhat, oh what, can do away
such happiness as that?"
 
"Many, many circumstances," said Elinor, solemnly.
 
"No, no, no," cried Marianne wildly, "he loves you, and only you.  You
CAN have no grief."
 
"I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state."
 
"And you will never see me otherwise.  Mine is a misery which nothing
can do away."
 
"You must not talk so, Marianne.  Have you no comforts? no friends?  Is
your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation?  Much as you
suffer now, think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of
his character had been delayed to a later periodif your engagement
had been carried on for months and months, as it might have been,
before he chose to put an end to it.  Every additional day of unhappy
confidence, on your side, would have made the blow more dreadful."
 
"Engagement!" cried Marianne, "there has been no engagement."
 
"No engagement!"
 
"No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him.  He has broken no faith
with me."
 
"But he told you that he loved you."
 
"Yesnonever absolutely.  It was every day implied, but never
professedly declared.  Sometimes I thought it had beenbut it never
was."
 
"Yet you wrote to him?"
 
"Yescould that be wrong after all that had passed? But I cannot
talk."
 
Elinor said no more, and turning again to the three letters which now
raised a much stronger curiosity than before, directly ran over the
contents of all.  The first, which was what her sister had sent him on
their arrival in town, was to this effect.
 
                         Berkeley Street, January.
 
     "How surprised you will be, Willoughby, on
     receiving this and I think you will feel something
     more than surprise, when you know that I am in town.
     An opportunity of coming hither, though with Mrs.
     Jennings, was a temptation we could not resist.
     I wish you may receive this in time to come here
     tonight, but I will not depend on it.  At any rate
     I shall expect you tomorrow. For the present, adieu.
 
                                             "M.D."
 
Her second note, which had been written on the morning after the dance
at the Middletons, was in these words
 
     "I cannot express my disappointment in having
     missed you the day before yesterday, nor my astonishment
     at not having received any answer to a note which
     I sent you above a week ago.  I have been expecting
     to hear from you, and still more to see you, every
     hour of the day.  Pray call again as soon as possible,
     and explain the reason of my having expected this
     in vain.  You had better come earlier another time,
     because we are generally out by one.  We were last
     night at Lady Middletons, where there was a dance.
     I have been told that you were asked to be of the
     party.  But could it be so?  You must be very much
     altered indeed since we parted, if that could be
     the case, and you not there.  But I will not suppose
     this possible, and I hope very soon to receive your
     personal assurance of its being otherwise.
 
                                            "M.D."
 
The contents of her last note to him were these
 
     "What am I to imagine, Willoughby, by your
     behaviour last night?  Again I demand an explanation
     of it.  I was prepared to meet you with the pleasure
     which our separation naturally produced, with the
     familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared
     to me to justify.  I was repulsed indeed! I have
     passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse
     a conduct which can scarcely be called less than
     insulting but though I have not yet been able to
     form any reasonable apology for your behaviour,
     I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of
     it.  You have perhaps been misinformed, or purposely
     deceived, in something concerning me, which may have
     lowered me in your opinion.  Tell me what it is,
     explain the grounds on which you acted, and I shall
     be satisfied, in being able to satisfy you.  It
     would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill
     of you but if I am to do it, if I am to learn that
     you are not what we have hitherto believed you, that
     your regard for us all was insincere, that your
     behaviour to me was intended only to deceive, let
     it be told as soon as possible.  My feelings are at
     present in a state of dreadful indecision I wish
     to acquit you, but certainty on either side will be
     ease to what I now suffer.  If your sentiments are
     no longer what they were, you will return my notes,
     and the lock of my hair which is in your possession.
 
                                             "M.D."
 
That such letters, so full of affection and confidence, could have been
so answered, Elinor, for Willoughbys sake, would have been unwilling
to believe.  But her condemnation of him did not blind her to the
impropriety of their having been written at all and she was silently
grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs
of tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding, and most severely
condemned by the event, when Marianne, perceiving that she had finished
the letters, observed to her that they contained nothing but what any
one would have written in the same situation.
 
"I felt myself," she added, "to be as solemnly engaged to him, as if
the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other."
 
"I can believe it," said Elinor "but unfortunately he did not feel the
same."
 
"He DID feel the same, Elinorfor weeks and weeks he felt it.  I know
he did.  Whatever may have changed him now, and nothing but the
blackest art employed against me can have done it, I was once as dear
to him as my own soul could wish.  This lock of hair, which now he can
so readily give up, was begged of me with the most earnest
supplication.  Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his
voice at that moment!  Have you forgot the last evening of our being
together at Barton?  The morning that we parted too!  When he told me
that it might be many weeks before we met againhis distresscan I
ever forget his distress?"
 
For a moment or two she could say no more but when this emotion had
passed away, she added, in a firmer tone,
 
"Elinor, I have been cruelly used but not by Willoughby."
 
"Dearest Marianne, who but himself?  By whom can he have been
instigated?"
 
"By all the world, rather than by his own heart.  I could rather
believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me
in his opinion, than believe his nature capable of such cruelty.  This
woman of whom he writeswhoever she beor any one, in short, but your
own dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous to bely me.
Beyond you three, is there a creature in the world whom I would not
rather suspect of evil than Willoughby, whose heart I know so well?"
 
Elinor would not contend, and only replied, "Whoever may have been so
detestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph,
my dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own
innocence and good intentions supports your spirits.  It is a
reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence."
 
"No, no," cried Marianne, "misery such as mine has no pride.  I care
not who knows that I am wretched.  The triumph of seeing me so may be
open to all the world.  Elinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may be
proud and independent as they likemay resist insult, or return
mortificationbut I cannot.  I must feelI must be wretchedand they
are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can."
 
"But for my mothers sake and mine"
 
"I would do more than for my own.  But to appear happy when I am so
miserableOh! who can require it?"
 
Again they were both silent.  Elinor was employed in walking
thoughtfully from the fire to the window, from the window to the fire,
without knowing that she received warmth from one, or discerning
objects through the other and Marianne, seated at the foot of the bed,
with her head leaning against one of its posts, again took up
Willoughbys letter, and, after shuddering over every sentence,
exclaimed
 
"It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this be yours!
Cruel, cruelnothing can acquit you.  Elinor, nothing can.  Whatever
he might have heard against meought he not to have suspended his
belief? ought he not to have told me of it, to have given me the power
of clearing myself? The lock of hair, repeating it from the letter,
which you so obligingly bestowed on meThat is unpardonable.
Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?  Oh,
barbarously insolent!Elinor, can he be justified?"
 
"No, Marianne, in no possible way."
 
"And yet this womanwho knows what her art may have been?how long it
may have been premeditated, and how deeply contrived by her!Who is
she?Who can she be?Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and
attractive among his female acquaintance?Oh! no one, no onehe
talked to me only of myself."
 
Another pause ensued Marianne was greatly agitated, and it ended thus.
 
"Elinor, I must go home.  I must go and comfort mama.  Can not we be
gone tomorrow?"
 
"Tomorrow, Marianne!"
 
"Yes, why should I stay here? I came only for Willoughbys sakeand
now who cares for me? Who regards me?"
 
"It would be impossible to go tomorrow. We owe Mrs. Jennings much more
than civility and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a
hasty removal as that."
 
"Well then, another day or two, perhaps but I cannot stay here long, I
cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people.
The Middletons and Palmershow am I to bear their pity?  The pity of
such a woman as Lady Middleton!  Oh, what would HE say to that!"
 
Elinor advised her to lie down again, and for a moment she did so but
no attitude could give her ease and in restless pain of mind and body
she moved from one posture to another, till growing more and more
hysterical, her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at
all, and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for
assistance.  Some lavender drops, however, which she was at length
persuaded to take, were of use and from that time till Mrs. Jennings
returned, she continued on the bed quiet and motionless.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 30
 
 
Mrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her return, and without
waiting to have her request of admittance answered, opened the door and
walked in with a look of real concern.
 
"How do you do my dear?"said she in a voice of great compassion to
Marianne, who turned away her face without attempting to answer.
 
"How is she, Miss Dashwood?Poor thing! she looks very bad. No
wonder.  Ay, it is but too true.  He is to be married very soona
goodfornothing fellow!  I have no patience with him.  Mrs. Taylor
told me of it half an hour ago, and she was told it by a particular
friend of Miss Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed
it and I was almost ready to sink as it was.  Well, said I, all I can
say is, that if this be true, he has used a young lady of my
acquaintance abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife may
plague his heart out.  And so I shall always say, my dear, you may
depend on it.  I have no notion of mens going on in this way and if
ever I meet him again, I will give him such a dressing as he has not
had this many a day.  But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne
he is not the only young man in the world worth having and with your
pretty face you will never want admirers.  Well, poor thing!  I wont
disturb her any longer, for she had better have her cry out at once and
have done with.  The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight
you know, and that will amuse her."
 
She then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room, as if she
supposed her young friends affliction could be increased by noise.
 
Marianne, to the surprise of her sister, determined on dining with
them.  Elinor even advised her against it.  But "no, she would go down
she could bear it very well, and the bustle about her would be less."
Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive,
though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner,
said no more and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could,
while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her into
the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it.
 
When there, though looking most wretchedly, she ate more and was calmer
than her sister had expected.  Had she tried to speak, or had she been
conscious of half Mrs. Jenningss wellmeant but illjudged attentions
to her, this calmness could not have been maintained but not a
syllable escaped her lips and the abstraction of her thoughts
preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her.
 
Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jenningss kindness, though its
effusions were often distressing, and sometimes almost ridiculous, made
her those acknowledgments, and returned her those civilities, which her
sister could not make or return for herself.  Their good friend saw
that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing was due to her
which might make her at all less so.  She treated her therefore, with
all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the
last day of its holidays.  Marianne was to have the best place by the
fire, was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house, and to
be amused by the relation of all the news of the day.  Had not Elinor,
in the sad countenance of her sister, seen a check to all mirth, she
could have been entertained by Mrs. Jenningss endeavours to cure a
disappointment in love, by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a
good fire.  As soon, however, as the consciousness of all this was
forced by continual repetition on Marianne, she could stay no longer.
With a hasty exclamation of Misery, and a sign to her sister not to
follow her, she directly got up and hurried out of the room.
 
"Poor soul!" cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was gone, "how it
grieves me to see her!  And I declare if she is not gone away without
finishing her wine!  And the dried cherries too!  Lord! nothing seems
to do her any good.  I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I
would send all over the town for it.  Well, it is the oddest thing to
me, that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill!  But when there is
plenty of money on one side, and next to none on the other, Lord bless
you! they care no more about such things!"
 
"The lady thenMiss Grey I think you called heris very rich?"
 
"Fifty thousand pounds, my dear.  Did you ever see her? a smart,
stylish girl they say, but not handsome.  I remember her aunt very
well, Biddy Henshawe she married a very wealthy man.  But the family
are all rich together.  Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it
wont come before its wanted for they say he is all to pieces.  No
wonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters!  Well, it dont
signify talking but when a young man, be who he will, comes and makes
love to a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he has no business to fly
off from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer girl is
ready to have him.  Why dont he, in such a case, sell his horses, let
his house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once? I
warrant you, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters
came round.  But that wont do nowadays nothing in the way of
pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age."
 
"Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is?  Is she said to be
amiable?"
 
"I never heard any harm of her indeed I hardly ever heard her
mentioned except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning, that one day
Miss Walker hinted to her, that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would
not be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison could
never agree."
 
"And who are the Ellisons?"
 
"Her guardians, my dear.  But now she is of age and may choose for
herself and a pretty choice she has made!What now," after pausing a
moment"your poor sister is gone to her own room, I suppose, to moan
by herself.  Is there nothing one can get to comfort her?  Poor dear,
it seems quite cruel to let her be alone.  Well, byandby we shall
have a few friends, and that will amuse her a little.  What shall we
play at?  She hates whist I know but is there no round game she cares
for?"
 
"Dear maam, this kindness is quite unnecessary.  Marianne, I dare say,
will not leave her room again this evening.  I shall persuade her if I
can to go early to bed, for I am sure she wants rest."
 
"Aye, I believe that will be best for her.  Let her name her own
supper, and go to bed.  Lord! no wonder she has been looking so bad and
so cast down this last week or two, for this matter I suppose has been
hanging over her head as long as that.  And so the letter that came
today finished it!  Poor soul!  I am sure if I had had a notion of it,
I would not have joked her about it for all my money.  But then you
know, how should I guess such a thing?  I made sure of its being
nothing but a common love letter, and you know young people like to be
laughed at about them.  Lord!  how concerned Sir John and my daughters
will be when they hear it!  If I had my senses about me I might have
called in Conduit Street in my way home, and told them of it.  But I
shall see them tomorrow."
 
"It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and
Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby, or making the slightest
allusion to what has passed, before my sister.  Their own goodnature
must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing
about it when she is present and the less that may ever be said to
myself on the subject, the more my feelings will be spared, as you my
dear madam will easily believe."
 
"Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed.  It must be terrible for you to hear
it talked of and as for your sister, I am sure I would not mention a
word about it to her for the world.  You saw I did not all dinner time.
No more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are all very
thoughtful and considerate especially if I give them a hint, as I
certainly will.  For my part, I think the less that is said about such
things, the better, the sooner tis blown over and forgot.  And what
does talking ever do you know?"
 
"In this affair it can only do harm more so perhaps than in many cases
of a similar kind, for it has been attended by circumstances which, for
the sake of every one concerned in it, make it unfit to become the
public conversation.  I must do THIS justice to Mr. Willoughbyhe has
broken no positive engagement with my sister."
 
"Law, my dear!  Dont pretend to defend him.  No positive engagement
indeed! after taking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on the
very rooms they were to live in hereafter!"
 
Elinor, for her sisters sake, could not press the subject farther, and
she hoped it was not required of her for Willoughbys since, though
Marianne might lose much, he could gain very little by the enforcement
of the real truth.  After a short silence on both sides, Mrs. Jennings,
with all her natural hilarity, burst forth again.
 
"Well, my dear, tis a true saying about an illwind, for it will be
all the better for Colonel Brandon.  He will have her at last aye,
that he will.  Mind me, now, if they ant married by Midsummer.  Lord!
how hell chuckle over this news!  I hope he will come tonight.  It
will be all to one a better match for your sister.  Two thousand a year
without debt or drawbackexcept the little lovechild, indeed aye, I
had forgot her but she may be prenticed out at a small cost, and then
what does it signify?  Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you
exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts and
conveniences quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered
with the best fruittrees in the country and such a mulberry tree in
one corner!  Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were
there!  Then, there is a dovecote, some delightful stewponds, and a
very pretty canal and every thing, in short, that one could wish for
and, moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile
from the turnpikeroad, so tis never dull, for if you only go and sit
up in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the carriages
that pass along.  Oh! tis a nice place!  A butcher hard by in the
village, and the parsonagehouse within a stones throw.  To my fancy,
a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are forced to
send three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour nearer than
your mother.  Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can.
One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down.  If we CAN but
put Willoughby out of her head!"
 
"Ay, if we can do THAT, Maam," said Elinor, "we shall do very well
with or without Colonel Brandon." And then rising, she went away to
join Marianne, whom she found, as she expected, in her own room,
leaning, in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire, which,
till Elinors entrance, had been her only light.
 
"You had better leave me," was all the notice that her sister received
from her.
 
"I will leave you," said Elinor, "if you will go to bed." But this,
from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she at first
refused to do.  Her sisters earnest, though gentle persuasion,
however, soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her lay her
aching head on the pillow, and as she hoped, in a way to get some quiet
rest before she left her.
 
In the drawingroom, whither she then repaired, she was soon joined by
Mrs. Jennings, with a wineglass, full of something, in her hand.
 
"My dear," said she, entering, "I have just recollected that I have
some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was
tasted, so I have brought a glass of it for your sister.  My poor
husband! how fond he was of it!  Whenever he had a touch of his old
colicky gout, he said it did him more good than any thing else in the
world.  Do take it to your sister."
 
"Dear Maam," replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of the
complaints for which it was recommended, "how good you are!  But I have
just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep and as I think
nothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give me
leave, I will drink the wine myself."
 
Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been five minutes
earlier, was satisfied with the compromise and Elinor, as she
swallowed the chief of it, reflected, that though its effects on a
colicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her, its healing
powers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself
as on her sister.
 
Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea, and by his manner
of looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied that
he neither expected nor wished to see her there, and, in short, that he
was already aware of what occasioned her absence.  Mrs. Jennings was
not struck by the same thought for soon after his entrance, she walked
across the room to the teatable where Elinor presided, and whispered
"The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.  He knows nothing of it
do tell him, my dear."
 
He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers, and, with a look
which perfectly assured her of his good information, inquired after her
sister.
 
"Marianne is not well," said she.  "She has been indisposed all day,
and we have persuaded her to go to bed."
 
"Perhaps, then," he hesitatingly replied, "what I heard this morning
may bethere may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at
first."
 
"What did you hear?"
 
"That a gentleman, whom I had reason to thinkin short, that a man,
whom I KNEW to be engagedbut how shall I tell you?  If you know it
already, as surely you must, I may be spared."
 
"You mean," answered Elinor, with forced calmness, "Mr. Willoughbys
marriage with Miss Grey.  Yes, we DO know it all.  This seems to have
been a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded
it to us.  Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable!  Where did you hear it?"
 
"In a stationers shop in Pall Mall, where I had business.  Two ladies
were waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the other
an account of the intended match, in a voice so little attempting
concealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all.  The name
of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught my
attention and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing
was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Greyit was
no longer to be a secretit would take place even within a few weeks,
with many particulars of preparations and other matters.  One thing,
especially, I remember, because it served to identify the man still
moreas soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to Combe
Magna, his seat in Somersetshire.  My astonishment!but it would be
impossible to describe what I felt.  The communicative lady I learnt,
on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop till they were gone, was a Mrs.
Ellison, and that, as I have been since informed, is the name of Miss
Greys guardian."
 
"It is.  But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand
pounds?  In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation."
 
"It may be so but Willoughby is capableat least I think"he stopped
a moment then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself, "And
your sisterhow did she"
 
"Her sufferings have been very severe.  I have only to hope that they
may be proportionately short.  It has been, it is a most cruel
affliction.  Till yesterday, I believe, she never doubted his regard
and even now, perhapsbut I am almost convinced that he never was
really attached to her.  He has been very deceitful! and, in some
points, there seems a hardness of heart about him."
 
"Ah!" said Colonel Brandon, "there is, indeed!  But your sister does
notI think you said soshe does not consider quite as you do?"
 
"You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly she would still
justify him if she could."
 
He made no answer and soon afterwards, by the removal of the
teathings, and the arrangement of the card parties, the subject was
necessarily dropped.  Mrs. Jennings, who had watched them with pleasure
while they were talking, and who expected to see the effect of Miss
Dashwoods communication, in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel
Brandons side, as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of
hope and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole evening
more serious and thoughtful than usual.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 31
 
 
From a night of more sleep than she had expected, Marianne awoke the
next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had
closed her eyes.
 
Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt and
before breakfast was ready, they had gone through the subject again and
again and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on
Elinors side, the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on
Mariannes, as before.  Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to be as
unfortunate and as innocent as herself, and at others, lost every
consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him.  At one moment she
was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world, at
another she would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third
could resist it with energy.  In one thing, however, she was uniform,
when it came to the point, in avoiding, where it was possible, the
presence of Mrs. Jennings, and in a determined silence when obliged to
endure it.  Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs.
Jenningss entering into her sorrows with any compassion.
 
"No, no, no, it cannot be," she cried "she cannot feel.  Her kindness
is not sympathy her goodnature is not tenderness.  All that she wants
is gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it."
 
Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her
sister was often led in her opinion of others, by the irritable
refinement of her own mind, and the too great importance placed by her
on the delicacies of a strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished
manner.  Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there be
that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent abilities and an
excellent disposition, was neither reasonable nor candid.  She expected
from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own, and she
judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on
herself.  Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters were together
in their own room after breakfast, which sunk the heart of Mrs.
Jennings still lower in her estimation because, through her own
weakness, it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself, though
Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill.
 
With a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance gaily smiling,
from the persuasion of bringing comfort, she entered their room, saying,
 
"Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure will do you good."
 
Marianne heard enough.  In one moment her imagination placed before her
a letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness and contrition,
explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory, convincing and
instantly followed by Willoughby himself, rushing eagerly into the room
to inforce, at her feet, by the eloquence of his eyes, the assurances
of his letter.  The work of one moment was destroyed by the next.  The
hand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome, was before her
and, in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an
ecstasy of more than hope, she felt as if, till that instant, she had
never suffered.
 
The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within her reach in her
moments of happiest eloquence, could have expressed and now she could
reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with
passionate violencea reproach, however, so entirely lost on its
object, that after many expressions of pity, she withdrew, still
referring her to the letter of comfort.  But the letter, when she was
calm enough to read it, brought little comfort.  Willoughby filled
every page.  Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and
relying as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused by
Elinors application, to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards
them both and this, with such tenderness towards her, such affection
for Willoughby, and such a conviction of their future happiness in each
other, that she wept with agony through the whole of it.
 
All her impatience to be at home again now returned her mother was
dearer to her than ever dearer through the very excess of her mistaken
confidence in Willoughby, and she was wildly urgent to be gone.
Elinor, unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne
to be in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own except of
patience till their mothers wishes could be known and at length she
obtained her sisters consent to wait for that knowledge.
 
Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual for she could not be easy
till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself
and positively refusing Elinors offered attendance, went out alone for
the rest of the morning.  Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of the
pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving, by Mariannes
letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it, then
sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed, and entreat
her directions for the future while Marianne, who came into the
drawingroom on Mrs. Jenningss going away, remained fixed at the table
where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen, grieving over
her for the hardship of such a task, and grieving still more fondly
over its effect on her mother.
 
In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour, when
Marianne, whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise, was
startled by a rap at the door.
 
"Who can this be?" cried Elinor.  "So early too! I thought we HAD been
safe."
 
Marianne moved to the window
 
"It is Colonel Brandon!" said she, with vexation.  "We are never safe
from HIM."
 
"He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home."
 
"I will not trust to THAT," retreating to her own room.  "A man who has
nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on
that of others."
 
The event proved her conjecture right, though it was founded on
injustice and error for Colonel Brandon DID come in and Elinor, who
was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither, and who
saw THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look, and in his
anxious though brief inquiry after her, could not forgive her sister
for esteeming him so lightly.
 
"I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street," said he, after the first
salutation, "and she encouraged me to come on and I was the more
easily encouraged, because I thought it probable that I might find you
alone, which I was very desirous of doing.  My objectmy wishmy sole
wish in desiring itI hope, I believe it isis to be a means of
giving comfortno, I must not say comfortnot present comfortbut
conviction, lasting conviction to your sisters mind.  My regard for
her, for yourself, for your motherwill you allow me to prove it, by
relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY sincere
regardnothing but an earnest desire of being usefulI think I am
justifiedthough where so many hours have been spent in convincing
myself that I am right, is there not some reason to fear I may be
wrong?" He stopped.
 
"I understand you," said Elinor.  "You have something to tell me of Mr.
Willoughby, that will open his character farther.  Your telling it will
be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn Marianne.  MY
gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to
that end, and HERS must be gained by it in time.  Pray, pray let me
hear it."
 
"You shall and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton last October,but
this will give you no ideaI must go farther back.  You will find me a
very awkward narrator, Miss Dashwood I hardly know where to begin.  A
short account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it SHALL be
a short one.  On such a subject," sighing heavily, "can I have little
temptation to be diffuse."
 
He stopt a moment for recollection, and then, with another sigh, went
on.
 
"You have probably entirely forgotten a conversationit is not to be
supposed that it could make any impression on youa conversation
between us one evening at Barton Parkit was the evening of a
dancein which I alluded to a lady I had once known, as resembling, in
some measure, your sister Marianne."
 
"Indeed," answered Elinor, "I have NOT forgotten it." He looked pleased
by this remembrance, and added,
 
"If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender
recollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well
in mind as person.  The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of
fancy and spirits.  This lady was one of my nearest relations, an
orphan from her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father.  Our
ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were
playfellows and friends.  I cannot remember the time when I did not
love Eliza and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as
perhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you
might think me incapable of having ever felt.  Hers, for me, was, I
believe, fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and
it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate.  At
seventeen she was lost to me for ever.  She was marriedmarried
against her inclination to my brother.  Her fortune was large, and our
family estate much encumbered.  And this, I fear, is all that can be
said for the conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian.
My brother did not deserve her he did not even love her.  I had hoped
that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty, and for
some time it did but at last the misery of her situation, for she
experienced great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though
she had promised me that nothingbut how blindly I relate!  I have
never told you how this was brought on.  We were within a few hours of
eloping together for Scotland.  The treachery, or the folly, of my
cousins maid betrayed us.  I was banished to the house of a relation
far distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,
till my fathers point was gained.  I had depended on her fortitude too
far, and the blow was a severe onebut had her marriage been happy, so
young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at
least I should not have now to lament it.  This however was not the
case.  My brother had no regard for her his pleasures were not what
they ought to have been, and from the first he treated her unkindly.
The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so
inexperienced as Mrs. Brandons, was but too natural.  She resigned
herself at first to all the misery of her situation and happy had it
been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the
remembrance of me occasioned.  But can we wonder that, with such a
husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or
restrain her for my father lived only a few months after their
marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies she should
fall?  Had I remained in England, perhapsbut I meant to promote the
happiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that purpose
had procured my exchange.  The shock which her marriage had given me,"
he continued, in a voice of great agitation, "was of trifling
weightwas nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two years
afterwards, of her divorce.  It was THAT which threw this gloom,even
now the recollection of what I suffered"
 
He could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about
the room.  Elinor, affected by his relation, and still more by his
distress, could not speak.  He saw her concern, and coming to her, took
her hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect.  A few
minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.
 
"It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned
to England.  My first care, when I DID arrive, was of course to seek
for her but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy.  I could
not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason to
fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of
sin.  Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune, nor
sufficient for her comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my
brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months
before to another person.  He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it,
that her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her to
dispose of it for some immediate relief.  At last, however, and after I
had been six months in England, I DID find her.  Regard for a former
servant of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to
visit him in a spunginghouse, where he was confined for debt and
there, in the same house, under a similar confinement, was my unfortunate
sister.  So alteredso fadedworn down by acute suffering of every
kind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before
me, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl, on whom
I had once doted.  What I endured in so beholding herbut I have no
right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe itI have
pained you too much already.  That she was, to all appearance, in the
last stage of a consumption, wasyes, in such a situation it was my
greatest comfort.  Life could do nothing for her, beyond giving time
for a better preparation for death and that was given.  I saw her
placed in comfortable lodgings, and under proper attendants I visited
her every day during the rest of her short life I was with her in her
last moments."
 
Again he stopped to recover himself and Elinor spoke her feelings in
an exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his unfortunate friend.
 
"Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended," said he, "by the resemblance
I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation.  Their
fates, their fortunes, cannot be the same and had the natural sweet
disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a happier
marriage, she might have been all that you will live to see the other
be.  But to what does all this lead?  I seem to have been distressing
you for nothing.  Ah! Miss Dashwooda subject such as thisuntouched
for fourteen yearsit is dangerous to handle it at all!  I WILL be
more collectedmore concise.  She left to my care her only child, a
little girl, the offspring of her first guilty connection, who was then
about three years old.  She loved the child, and had always kept it
with her.  It was a valued, a precious trust to me and gladly would I
have discharged it in the strictest sense, by watching over her
education myself, had the nature of our situations allowed it but I
had no family, no home and my little Eliza was therefore placed at
school.  I saw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my
brother, which happened about five years ago, and which left to me the
possession of the family property, she visited me at Delaford.  I
called her a distant relation but I am well aware that I have in
general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her.  It is now
three years ago she had just reached her fourteenth year, that I
removed her from school, to place her under the care of a very
respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the charge of four
or five other girls of about the same time of life and for two years I
had every reason to be pleased with her situation.  But last February,
almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared.  I had allowed
her, imprudently, as it has since turned out, at her earnest desire,
to go to Bath with one of her young friends, who was attending her
father there for his health.  I knew him to be a very good sort of man,
and I thought well of his daughterbetter than she deserved, for, with
a most obstinate and illjudged secrecy, she would tell nothing, would
give no clue, though she certainly knew all.  He, her father, a
wellmeaning, but not a quicksighted man, could really, I believe,
give no information for he had been generally confined to the house,
while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance
they chose and he tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was
convinced himself, of his daughters being entirely unconcerned in the
business.  In short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone all
the rest, for eight long months, was left to conjecture.  What I
thought, what I feared, may be imagined and what I suffered too."
 
"Good heavens!" cried Elinor, "could it becould Willoughby!"
 
"The first news that reached me of her," he continued, "came in a
letter from herself, last October.  It was forwarded to me from
Delaford, and I received it on the very morning of our intended party
to Whitwell and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,
which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body,
and which I believe gave offence to some.  Little did Mr. Willoughby
imagine, I suppose, when his looks censured me for incivility in
breaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one whom
he had made poor and miserable but HAD he known it, what would it have
availed?  Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of
your sister?  No, he had already done that, which no man who CAN feel
for another would do.  He had left the girl whose youth and innocence
he had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with no
creditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his address!  He had
left her, promising to return he neither returned, nor wrote, nor
relieved her."
 
"This is beyond every thing!" exclaimed Elinor.
 
"His character is now before you expensive, dissipated, and worse than
both.  Knowing all this, as I have now known it many weeks, guess what
I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever, and on
being assured that she was to marry him guess what I must have felt
for all your sakes.  When I came to you last week and found you alone,
I came determined to know the truth though irresolute what to do when
it WAS known.  My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then but
now you will comprehend it.  To suffer you all to be so deceived to
see your sisterbut what could I do?  I had no hope of interfering
with success and sometimes I thought your sisters influence might yet
reclaim him.  But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what
were his designs on her.  Whatever they may have been, however, she may
now, and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own
condition, when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she
considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl, and
pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong, still as
strong as her own, and with a mind tormented by selfreproach, which
must attend her through life.  Surely this comparison must have its use
with her.  She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing.  They
proceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace.  On the
contrary, every friend must be made still more her friend by them.
Concern for her unhappiness, and respect for her fortitude under it,
must strengthen every attachment.  Use your own discretion, however, in
communicating to her what I have told you.  You must know best what
will be its effect but had I not seriously, and from my heart believed
it might be of service, might lessen her regrets, I would not have
suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family
afflictions, with a recital which may seem to have been intended to
raise myself at the expense of others."
 
Elinors thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness
attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to
Marianne, from the communication of what had passed.
 
"I have been more pained," said she, "by her endeavors to acquit him
than by all the rest for it irritates her mind more than the most
perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do.  Now, though at first
she will suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier.  Have
you," she continued, after a short silence, "ever seen Mr. Willoughby
since you left him at Barton?"
 
"Yes," he replied gravely, "once I have.  One meeting was unavoidable."
 
Elinor, startled by his manner, looked at him anxiously, saying,
 
"What? have you met him to"
 
"I could meet him no other way.  Eliza had confessed to me, though most
reluctantly, the name of her lover and when he returned to town, which
was within a fortnight after myself, we met by appointment, he to
defend, I to punish his conduct.  We returned unwounded, and the
meeting, therefore, never got abroad."
 
Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this but to a man and a
soldier she presumed not to censure it.
 
"Such," said Colonel Brandon, after a pause, "has been the unhappy
resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter! and so imperfectly
have I discharged my trust!"
 
"Is she still in town?"
 
"No as soon as she recovered from her lyingin, for I found her near
her delivery, I removed her and her child into the country, and there
she remains."
 
Recollecting, soon afterwards, that he was probably dividing Elinor
from her sister, he put an end to his visit, receiving from her again
the same grateful acknowledgments, and leaving her full of compassion
and esteem for him.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 32
 
 
When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss
Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her was
not entirely such as the former had hoped to see.  Not that Marianne
appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened to
it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither
objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and
seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible.  But
though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt
WAS carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the
effect of it, in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called,
in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, with a kind of
compassionate respect, and though she saw her spirits less violently
irritated than before, she did not see her less wretched.  Her mind did
become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection.  She felt the
loss of Willoughbys character yet more heavily than she had felt the
loss of his heart his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, the
misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE
have been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits, that
she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor
and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave more pain to her sister
than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent
confession of them.
 
To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and
answering Elinors letter would be only to give a repetition of what
her daughters had already felt and said of a disappointment hardly
less painful than Mariannes, and an indignation even greater than
Elinors.  Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,
arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought to express her
anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she would bear up with
fortitude under this misfortune.  Bad indeed must the nature of
Mariannes affliction be, when her mother could talk of fortitude!
mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which
SHE could wish her not to indulge!
 
Against the interest of her own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had
determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, at
that time, than at Barton, where every thing within her view would be
bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by
constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as she had always seen
him there.  She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all
means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings the length of which,
though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at
least five or six weeks.  A variety of occupations, of objects, and of
company, which could not be procured at Barton, would be inevitable
there, and might yet, she hoped, cheat Marianne, at times, into some
interest beyond herself, and even into some amusement, much as the
ideas of both might now be spurned by her.
 
From all danger of seeing Willoughby again, her mother considered her
to be at least equally safe in town as in the country, since his
acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her
friends.  Design could never bring them in each others way negligence
could never leave them exposed to a surprise and chance had less in
its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of
Barton, where it might force him before her while paying that visit at
Allenham on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at first
as a probable event, had brought herself to expect as a certain one.
 
She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where
they were a letter from her soninlaw had told her that he and his
wife were to be in town before the middle of February, and she judged
it right that they should sometimes see their brother.
 
Marianne had promised to be guided by her mothers opinion, and she
submitted to it therefore without opposition, though it proved
perfectly different from what she wished and expected, though she felt
it to be entirely wrong, formed on mistaken grounds, and that by
requiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only
possible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal sympathy of her
mother, and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent
her ever knowing a moments rest.
 
But it was a matter of great consolation to her, that what brought evil
to herself would bring good to her sister and Elinor, on the other
hand, suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid Edward
entirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer stay
would therefore militate against her own happiness, it would be better
for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.
 
Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughbys
name mentioned, was not thrown away.  Marianne, though without knowing
it herself, reaped all its advantage for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor
Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her.
Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards
herself, but that was impossible, and she was obliged to listen day
after day to the indignation of them all.
 
Sir John, could not have thought it possible.  "A man of whom he had
always had such reason to think well!  Such a goodnatured fellow!  He
did not believe there was a bolder rider in England!  It was an
unaccountable business.  He wished him at the devil with all his heart.
He would not speak another word to him, meet him where he might, for
all the world!  No, not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert,
and they were kept watching for two hours together.  Such a scoundrel
of a fellow! such a deceitful dog!  It was only the last time they met
that he had offered him one of Follys puppies! and this was the end of
it!"
 
Mrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry.  "She was determined to
drop his acquaintance immediately, and she was very thankful that she
had never been acquainted with him at all.  She wished with all her
heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland but it did not signify,
for it was a great deal too far off to visit she hated him so much
that she was resolved never to mention his name again, and she should
tell everybody she saw, how goodfornothing he was."
 
The rest of Mrs. Palmers sympathy was shewn in procuring all the
particulars in her power of the approaching marriage, and communicating
them to Elinor.  She could soon tell at what coachmakers the new
carriage was building, by what painter Mr. Willoughbys portrait was
drawn, and at what warehouse Miss Greys clothes might be seen.
 
The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a
happy relief to Elinors spirits, oppressed as they often were by the
clamorous kindness of the others.  It was a great comfort to her to be
sure of exciting no interest in ONE person at least among their circle
of friends a great comfort to know that there was ONE who would meet
her without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any anxiety for
her sisters health.
 
Every qualification is raised at times, by the circumstances of the
moment, to more than its real value and she was sometimes worried down
by officious condolence to rate goodbreeding as more indispensable to
comfort than goodnature.
 
Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day,
or twice, if the subject occurred very often, by saying, "It is very
shocking, indeed!" and by the means of this continual though gentle
vent, was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first
without the smallest emotion, but very soon to see them without
recollecting a word of the matter and having thus supported the
dignity of her own sex, and spoken her decided censure of what was
wrong in the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend to the
interest of her own assemblies, and therefore determined though rather
against the opinion of Sir John that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once
be a woman of elegance and fortune, to leave her card with her as soon
as she married.
 
Colonel Brandons delicate, unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome
to Miss Dashwood.  He had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate
discussion of her sisters disappointment, by the friendly zeal with
which he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with
confidence.  His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing
past sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye
with which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of her
voice whenever though it did not often happen she was obliged, or
could oblige herself to speak to him.  THESE assured him that his
exertion had produced an increase of goodwill towards himself, and
THESE gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter but
Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that the
Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that she could neither prevail
on him to make the offer himself, nor commission her to make it for
him, began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of
Midsummer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the end of
a week that it would not be a match at all.  The good understanding
between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the
honours of the mulberrytree, the canal, and the yew arbour, would all
be made over to HER and Mrs. Jennings had, for some time ceased to
think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.
 
Early in February, within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughbys
letter, Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he
was married.  She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to
herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she was
desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from
the public papers, which she saw her eagerly examining every morning.
 
She received the news with resolute composure made no observation on
it, and at first shed no tears but after a short time they would burst
out, and for the rest of the day, she was in a state hardly less
pitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event.
 
The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married and Elinor now
hoped, as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them, to
prevail on her sister, who had never yet left the house since the blow
first fell, to go out again by degrees as she had done before.
 
About this time the two Miss Steeles, lately arrived at their cousins
house in Bartletts Buildings, Holburn, presented themselves again
before their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets and
were welcomed by them all with great cordiality.
 
Elinor only was sorry to see them.  Their presence always gave her
pain, and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the
overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her STILL in town.
 
"I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here
STILL," said she repeatedly, with a strong emphasis on the word.  "But
I always thought I SHOULD.  I was almost sure you would not leave
London yet awhile though you TOLD me, you know, at Barton, that you
should not stay above a MONTH.  But I thought, at the time, that you
would most likely change your mind when it came to the point.  It would
have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and
sister came.  And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone.  I
am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD."
 
Elinor perfectly understood her, and was forced to use all her
selfcommand to make it appear that she did NOT.
 
"Well, my dear," said Mrs. Jennings, "and how did you travel?"
 
"Not in the stage, I assure you," replied Miss Steele, with quick
exultation "we came post all the way, and had a very smart beau to
attend us.  Dr. Davies was coming to town, and so we thought wed join
him in a postchaise and he behaved very genteelly, and paid ten or
twelve shillings more than we did."
 
"Oh, oh!" cried Mrs. Jennings "very pretty, indeed! and the Doctor is
a single man, I warrant you."
 
"There now," said Miss Steele, affectedly simpering, "everybody laughs
at me so about the Doctor, and I cannot think why.  My cousins say they
are sure I have made a conquest but for my part I declare I never
think about him from one hours end to another.  Lord! here comes your
beau, Nancy, my cousin said tother day, when she saw him crossing the
street to the house.  My beau, indeed! said II cannot think who you
mean.  The Doctor is no beau of mine."
 
"Aye, aye, that is very pretty talkingbut it wont dothe Doctor is
the man, I see."
 
"No, indeed!" replied her cousin, with affected earnestness, "and I beg
you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked of."
 
Mrs. Jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she
certainly would NOT, and Miss Steele was made completely happy.
 
"I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister, Miss
Dashwood, when they come to town," said Lucy, returning, after a
cessation of hostile hints, to the charge.
 
"No, I do not think we shall."
 
"Oh, yes, I dare say you will."
 
Elinor would not humour her by farther opposition.
 
"What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for
so long a time together!"
 
"Long a time, indeed!" interposed Mrs. Jennings.  "Why, their visit is
but just begun!"
 
Lucy was silenced.
 
"I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood," said Miss
Steele.  "I am sorry she is not well" for Marianne had left the room
on their arrival.
 
"You are very good.  My sister will be equally sorry to miss the
pleasure of seeing you but she has been very much plagued lately with
nervous headaches, which make her unfit for company or conversation."
 
"Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old friends as Lucy and
me!I think she might see US and I am sure we would not speak a word."
 
Elinor, with great civility, declined the proposal.  Her sister was
perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her dressing gown, and therefore
not able to come to them.
 
"Oh, if thats all," cried Miss Steele, "we can just as well go and see
HER."
 
Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper but she
was saved the trouble of checking it, by Lucys sharp reprimand, which
now, as on many occasions, though it did not give much sweetness to the
manners of one sister, was of advantage in governing those of the other.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 33
 
 
After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sisters entreaties, and
consented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an
hour. She expressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits, and
would do no more than accompany them to Grays in Sackville Street,
where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few
oldfashioned jewels of her mother.
 
When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there was
a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call and as
she had no business at Grays, it was resolved, that while her young
friends transacted theirs, she should pay her visit and return for
them.
 
On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people before
them in the room, that there was not a person at liberty to tend to
their orders and they were obliged to wait.  All that could be done
was, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the
quickest succession one gentleman only was standing there, and it is
probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to
a quicker despatch.  But the correctness of his eye, and the delicacy
of his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness.  He was giving orders
for a toothpickcase for himself, and till its size, shape, and
ornaments were determined, all of which, after examining and debating
for a quarter of an hour over every toothpickcase in the shop, were
finally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had no leisure to
bestow any other attention on the two ladies, than what was comprised
in three or four very broad stares a kind of notice which served to
imprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face, of strong,
natural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in the first style of
fashion.
 
Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and
resentment, on this impertinent examination of their features, and on
the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of
the different toothpickcases presented to his inspection, by remaining
unconscious of it all for she was as well able to collect her thoughts
within herself, and be as ignorant of what was passing around her, in
Mr. Grays shop, as in her own bedroom.
 
At last the affair was decided.  The ivory, the gold, and the pearls,
all received their appointment, and the gentleman having named the last
day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of
the toothpickcase, drew on his gloves with leisurely care, and
bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such a one as
seemed rather to demand than express admiration, walked off with a
happy air of real conceit and affected indifference.
 
Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward, was on the point
of concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her side.
She turned her eyes towards his face, and found him with some surprise
to be her brother.
 
Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very
creditable appearance in Mr. Grays shop.  John Dashwood was really far
from being sorry to see his sisters again it rather gave them
satisfaction and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and
attentive.
 
Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days.
 
"I wished very much to call upon you yesterday," said he, "but it was
impossible, for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at
Exeter Exchange and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars.
Harry was vastly pleased.  THIS morning I had fully intended to call on
you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one has always so
much to do on first coming to town.  I am come here to bespeak Fanny a
seal.  But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in
Berkeley Street, and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings.  I
understand she is a woman of very good fortune.  And the Middletons
too, you must introduce me to THEM.  As my motherinlaws relations, I
shall be happy to show them every respect.  They are excellent
neighbours to you in the country, I understand."
 
"Excellent indeed.  Their attention to our comfort, their friendliness
in every particular, is more than I can express."
 
"I am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word extremely glad indeed.
But so it ought to be they are people of large fortune, they are
related to you, and every civility and accommodation that can serve to
make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected.  And so you
are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for
nothing!  Edward brought us a most charming account of the place the
most complete thing of its kind, he said, that ever was, and you all
seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing.  It was a great satisfaction to us
to hear it, I assure you."
 
Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother and was not sorry to
be spared the necessity of answering him, by the arrival of Mrs.
Jenningss servant, who came to tell her that his mistress waited for
them at the door.
 
Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was introduced to Mrs. Jennings
at the door of her carriage, and repeating his hope of being able to
call on them the next day, took leave.
 
His visit was duly paid.  He came with a pretence at an apology from
their sisterinlaw, for not coming too "but she was so much engaged
with her mother, that really she had no leisure for going any where."
Mrs. Jennings, however, assured him directly, that she should not stand
upon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something like it, and she
should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and bring her
sisters to see her.  His manners to THEM, though calm, were perfectly
kind to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil and on Colonel
Brandons coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a curiosity
which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know him to be rich, to be
equally civil to HIM.
 
After staying with them half an hour, he asked Elinor to walk with him
to Conduit Street, and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.
The weather was remarkably fine, and she readily consented.  As soon as
they were out of the house, his enquiries began.
 
"Who is Colonel Brandon?  Is he a man of fortune?"
 
"Yes he has very good property in Dorsetshire."
 
"I am glad of it.  He seems a most gentlemanlike man and I think,
Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable
establishment in life."
 
"Me, brother! what do you mean?"
 
"He likes you.  I observed him narrowly, and am convinced of it.  What
is the amount of his fortune?"
 
"I believe about two thousand a year."
 
"Two thousand ayear" and then working himself up to a pitch of
enthusiastic generosity, he added, "Elinor, I wish with all my heart it
were TWICE as much, for your sake."
 
"Indeed I believe you," replied Elinor "but I am very sure that
Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME."
 
"You are mistaken, Elinor you are very much mistaken.  A very little
trouble on your side secures him.  Perhaps just at present he may be
undecided the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back his
friends may all advise him against it.  But some of those little
attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix
him, in spite of himself.  And there can be no reason why you should
not try for him.  It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on
your sidein short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is
quite out of the question, the objections are insurmountableyou have
too much sense not to see all that.  Colonel Brandon must be the man
and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with
you and your family.  It is a match that must give universal
satisfaction.  In short, it is a kind of thing that"lowering his
voice to an important whisper"will be exceedingly welcome to ALL
PARTIES." Recollecting himself, however, he added, "That is, I mean to
sayyour friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled Fanny
particularly, for she has your interest very much at heart, I assure
you.  And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very goodnatured woman, I am
sure it would give her great pleasure she said as much the other day."
 
Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer.
 
"It would be something remarkable, now," he continued, "something
droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the
same time.  And yet it is not very unlikely."
 
"Is Mr. Edward Ferrars," said Elinor, with resolution, "going to be
married?"
 
"It is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in agitation.
He has a most excellent mother.  Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost
liberality, will come forward, and settle on him a thousand a year, if
the match takes place.  The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter
of the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds.  A very desirable
connection on both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place in
time.  A thousand ayear is a great deal for a mother to give away, to
make over for ever but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit.  To give you
another instance of her liberalityThe other day, as soon as we came
to town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now,
she put banknotes into Fannys hands to the amount of two hundred
pounds.  And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great
expense while we are here."
 
He paused for her assent and compassion and she forced herself to say,
 
"Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable
but your income is a large one."
 
"Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose.  I do not mean to
complain, however it is undoubtedly a comfortable one, and I hope will
in time be better.  The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on,
is a most serious drain.  And then I have made a little purchase within
this half year East Kingham Farm, you must remember the place, where
old Gibson used to live.  The land was so very desirable for me in
every respect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it
my duty to buy it.  I could not have answered it to my conscience to
let it fall into any other hands.  A man must pay for his convenience
and it HAS cost me a vast deal of money."
 
"More than you think it really and intrinsically worth."
 
"Why, I hope not that.  I might have sold it again, the next day, for
more than I gave but, with regard to the purchasemoney, I might have
been very unfortunate indeed for the stocks were at that time so low,
that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my bankers
hands, I must have sold out to very great loss."
 
Elinor could only smile.
 
"Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to
Norland.  Our respected father, as you well know, bequeathed all the
Stanhill effects that remained at Norland and very valuable they were
to your mother.  Far be it from me to repine at his doing so he had an
undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose, but, in
consequence of it, we have been obliged to make large purchases of
linen, china, c. to supply the place of what was taken away.  You may
guess, after all these expenses, how very far we must be from being
rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrarss kindness is."
 
"Certainly," said Elinor "and assisted by her liberality, I hope you
may yet live to be in easy circumstances."
 
"Another year or two may do much towards it," he gravely replied "but
however there is still a great deal to be done.  There is not a stone
laid of Fannys greenhouse, and nothing but the plan of the
flowergarden marked out."
 
"Where is the greenhouse to be?"
 
"Upon the knoll behind the house.  The old walnut trees are all come
down to make room for it.  It will be a very fine object from many
parts of the park, and the flowergarden will slope down just before
it, and be exceedingly pretty.  We have cleared away all the old thorns
that grew in patches over the brow."
 
Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself and was very
thankful that Marianne was not present, to share the provocation.
 
Having now said enough to make his poverty clear, and to do away the
necessity of buying a pair of earrings for each of his sisters, in his
next visit at Grays his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he began
to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.
 
"She seems a most valuable woman indeedHer house, her style of
living, all bespeak an exceeding good income and it is an acquaintance
that has not only been of great use to you hitherto, but in the end may
prove materially advantageous.Her inviting you to town is certainly a
vast thing in your favour and indeed, it speaks altogether so great a
regard for you, that in all probability when she dies you will not be
forgotten. She must have a great deal to leave."
 
"Nothing at all, I should rather suppose for she has only her
jointure, which will descend to her children."
 
"But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income.  Few
people of common prudence will do THAT and whatever she saves, she
will be able to dispose of."
 
"And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her
daughters, than to us?"
 
"Her daughters are both exceedingly well married, and therefore I
cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther.
Whereas, in my opinion, by her taking so much notice of you, and
treating you in this kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on
her future consideration, which a conscientious woman would not
disregard.  Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour and she can
hardly do all this, without being aware of the expectation it raises."
 
"But she raises none in those most concerned.  Indeed, brother, your
anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far."
 
"Why, to be sure," said he, seeming to recollect himself, "people have
little, have very little in their power.  But, my dear Elinor, what is
the matter with Marianne? she looks very unwell, has lost her colour,
and is grown quite thin.  Is she ill?"
 
"She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint on her for several
weeks."
 
"I am sorry for that.  At her time of life, any thing of an illness
destroys the bloom for ever!  Hers has been a very short one!  She was
as handsome a girl last September, as I ever saw and as likely to
attract the man.  There was something in her style of beauty, to please
them particularly.  I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry
sooner and better than you did not but what she is exceedingly fond of
YOU, but so it happened to strike her.  She will be mistaken, however.
I question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth more than five
or six hundred ayear, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if
YOU do not do better.  Dorsetshire!  I know very little of Dorsetshire
but, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it
and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the
earliest and best pleased of your visitors."
 
Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no
likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon but it was an expectation
of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he was really
resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the
marriage by every possible attention.  He had just compunction enough
for having done nothing for his sisters himself, to be exceedingly
anxious that everybody else should do a great deal and an offer from
Colonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means
of atoning for his own neglect.
 
They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John
came in before their visit ended.  Abundance of civilities passed on
all sides.  Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood
did not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him down as a very
goodnatured fellow while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his
appearance to think his acquaintance worth having and Mr. Dashwood
went away delighted with both.
 
"I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny," said he, as he
walked back with his sister.  "Lady Middleton is really a most elegant
woman!  Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know.  And Mrs.
Jennings too, an exceedingly wellbehaved woman, though not so elegant
as her daughter.  Your sister need not have any scruple even of
visiting HER, which, to say the truth, has been a little the case, and
very naturally for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a
man who had got all his money in a low way and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars
were both strongly prepossessed, that neither she nor her daughters
were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with.  But now
I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both."
 
 
 
CHAPTER 34
 
 
Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husbands judgment,
that she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her
daughter and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former,
even the woman with whom her sisters were staying, by no means unworthy
her notice and as for Lady Middleton, she found her one of the most
charming women in the world!
 
Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood.  There was a
kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually
attracted them and they sympathised with each other in an insipid
propriety of demeanor, and a general want of understanding.
 
The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the
good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings,
and to HER she appeared nothing more than a little proudlooking woman
of uncordial address, who met her husbands sisters without any
affection, and almost without having anything to say to them for of
the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street, she sat at least
seven minutes and a half in silence.
 
Elinor wanted very much to know, though she did not chuse to ask,
whether Edward was then in town but nothing would have induced Fanny
voluntarily to mention his name before her, till able to tell her that
his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her husbands
expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered because she believed
them still so very much attached to each other, that they could not be
too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion.  The
intelligence however, which SHE would not give, soon flowed from
another quarter.  Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinors compassion
on being unable to see Edward, though he had arrived in town with Mr.
and Mrs. Dashwood.  He dared not come to Bartletts Buildings for fear
of detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not to be
told, they could do nothing at present but write.
 
Edward assured them himself of his being in town, within a very short
time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street.  Twice was his card found on
the table, when they returned from their mornings engagements.  Elinor
was pleased that he had called and still more pleased that she had
missed him.
 
The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons, that,
though not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined to
give thema dinner and soon after their acquaintance began, invited
them to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very good house
for three months.  Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invited
likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who,
always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager
civilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure.  They were to
meet Mrs. Ferrars but Elinor could not learn whether her sons were to
be of the party.  The expectation of seeing HER, however, was enough to
make her interested in the engagement for though she could now meet
Edwards mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to
attend such an introduction, though she could now see her with perfect
indifference as to her opinion of herself, her desire of being in
company with Mrs. Ferrars, her curiosity to know what she was like, was
as lively as ever.
 
The interest with which she thus anticipated the party, was soon
afterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her hearing
that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it.
 
So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so agreeable
had their assiduities made them to her, that though Lucy was certainly
not so elegant, and her sister not even genteel, she was as ready as
Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street and it
happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles, as soon as
the Dashwoods invitation was known, that their visit should begin a
few days before the party took place.
 
Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the nieces of the
gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother, might not
have done much, however, towards procuring them seats at her table but
as Lady Middletons guests they must be welcome and Lucy, who had long
wanted to be personally known to the family, to have a nearer view of
their characters and her own difficulties, and to have an opportunity
of endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier in her life,
than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwoods card.
 
On Elinor its effect was very different.  She began immediately to
determine, that Edward who lived with his mother, must be asked as his
mother was, to a party given by his sister and to see him for the
first time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!she hardly
knew how she could bear it!
 
These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, and
certainly not at all on truth.  They were relieved however, not by her
own recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to
be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward
certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to
be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept
away by the extreme affection for herself, which he could not conceal
when they were together.
 
The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies
to this formidable motherinlaw.
 
"Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!" said Lucy, as they walked up the stairs
togetherfor the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings,
that they all followed the servant at the same time"There is nobody
here but you, that can feel for me.I declare I can hardly stand.
Good gracious!In a moment I shall see the person that all my
happiness depends onthat is to be my mother!"
 
Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the
possibility of its being Miss Mortons mother, rather than her own,
whom they were about to behold but instead of doing that, she assured
her, and with great sincerity, that she did pity herto the utter
amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at
least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.
 
Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright, even to formality, in
her figure, and serious, even to sourness, in her aspect.  Her
complexion was sallow and her features small, without beauty, and
naturally without expression but a lucky contraction of the brow had
rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity, by giving it
the strong characters of pride and ill nature.  She was not a woman of
many words for, unlike people in general, she proportioned them to the
number of her ideas and of the few syllables that did escape her, not
one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed with the spirited
determination of disliking her at all events.
 
Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour. A few months
ago it would have hurt her exceedingly but it was not in Mrs. Ferrars
power to distress her by it nowand the difference of her manners to
the Miss Steeles, a difference which seemed purposely made to humble
her more, only amused her.  She could not but smile to see the
graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person for
Lucy was particularly distinguishedwhom of all others, had they known
as much as she did, they would have been most anxious to mortify while
she herself, who had comparatively no power to wound them, sat
pointedly slighted by both.  But while she smiled at a graciousness so
misapplied, she could not reflect on the meanspirited folly from which
it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss
Steeles courted its continuance, without thoroughly despising them all
four.
 
Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished and Miss
Steele wanted only to be teazed about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy.
 
The dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous, and every thing
bespoke the Mistresss inclination for show, and the Masters ability
to support it.  In spite of the improvements and additions which were
making to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner having once
been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a
loss, nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to
infer from itno poverty of any kind, except of conversation,
appearedbut there, the deficiency was considerable.  John Dashwood
had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing, and his wife
had still less.  But there was no peculiar disgrace in this for it was
very much the case with the chief of their visitors, who almost all
laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being
agreeableWant of sense, either natural or improvedwant of
elegancewant of spiritsor want of temper.
 
When the ladies withdrew to the drawingroom after dinner, this poverty
was particularly evident, for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse
with some varietythe variety of politics, inclosing land, and
breaking horsesbut then it was all over and one subject only engaged
the ladies till coffee came in, which was the comparative heights of
Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middletons second son William, who were
nearly of the same age.
 
Had both the children been there, the affair might have been determined
too easily by measuring them at once but as Harry only was present, it
was all conjectural assertion on both sides and every body had a right
to be equally positive in their opinion, and to repeat it over and over
again as often as they liked.
 
The parties stood thus
 
The two mothers, though each really convinced that her own son was the
tallest, politely decided in favour of the other.
 
The two grandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity,
were equally earnest in support of their own descendant.
 
Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other,
thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age, and could not
conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world
between them and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it, as
fast as she could, in favour of each.
 
Elinor, having once delivered her opinion on Williams side, by which
she offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, did not see the
necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion and Marianne, when
called on for hers, offended them all, by declaring that she had no
opinion to give, as she had never thought about it.
 
Before her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty pair
of screens for her sisterinlaw, which being now just mounted and
brought home, ornamented her present drawing room and these screens,
catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other gentlemen
into the room, were officiously handed by him to Colonel Brandon for
his admiration.
 
"These are done by my eldest sister," said he "and you, as a man of
taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them.  I do not know whether
you have ever happened to see any of her performances before, but she
is in general reckoned to draw extremely well."
 
The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship,
warmly admired the screens, as he would have done any thing painted by
Miss Dashwood and on the curiosity of the others being of course
excited, they were handed round for general inspection.  Mrs. Ferrars,
not aware of their being Elinors work, particularly requested to look
at them and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady
Middletonss approbation, Fanny presented them to her mother,
considerately informing her, at the same time, that they were done by
Miss Dashwood.
 
"Hum"said Mrs. Ferrars"very pretty,"and without regarding them at
all, returned them to her daughter.
 
Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude
enough,for, colouring a little, she immediately said,
 
"They are very pretty, maamant they?" But then again, the dread of
having been too civil, too encouraging herself, probably came over her,
for she presently added,
 
"Do you not think they are something in Miss Mortons style of
painting, Maam?She DOES paint most delightfully!How beautifully
her last landscape is done!"
 
"Beautifully indeed!  But SHE does every thing well."
 
Marianne could not bear this.She was already greatly displeased with
Mrs. Ferrars and such illtimed praise of another, at Elinors
expense, though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by
it, provoked her immediately to say with warmth,
 
"This is admiration of a very particular kind!what is Miss Morton to
us?who knows, or who cares, for her?it is Elinor of whom WE think
and speak."
 
And so saying, she took the screens out of her sisterinlaws hands,
to admire them herself as they ought to be admired.
 
Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself up more
stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, "Miss
Morton is Lord Mortons daughter."
 
Fanny looked very angry too, and her husband was all in a fright at his
sisters audacity.  Elinor was much more hurt by Mariannes warmth than
she had been by what produced it but Colonel Brandons eyes, as they
were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was amiable
in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister
slighted in the smallest point.
 
Mariannes feelings did not stop here.  The cold insolence of Mrs.
Ferrarss general behaviour to her sister, seemed, to her, to foretell
such difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded heart
taught her to think of with horror and urged by a strong impulse of
affectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment, to her sisters
chair, and putting one arm round her neck, and one cheek close to hers,
said in a low, but eager, voice,
 
"Dear, dear Elinor, dont mind them.  Dont let them make YOU unhappy."
 
She could say no more her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her
face on Elinors shoulder, she burst into tears.  Every bodys
attention was called, and almost every body was concerned.Colonel
Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did.Mrs.
Jennings, with a very intelligent "Ah! poor dear," immediately gave her
her salts and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author
of this nervous distress, that he instantly changed his seat to one
close by Lucy Steele, and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account of
the whole shocking affair.
 
In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end
to the bustle, and sit down among the rest though her spirits retained
the impression of what had passed, the whole evening.
 
"Poor Marianne!" said her brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice,
as soon as he could secure his attention, "She has not such good
health as her sister,she is very nervous,she has not Elinors
constitutionand one must allow that there is something very trying
to a young woman who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal
attractions.  You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne WAS
remarkably handsome a few months ago quite as handsome as Elinor.
Now you see it is all gone."
 
 
 
CHAPTER 35
 
 
Elinors curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied. She had found
in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between
the families undesirable. She had seen enough of her pride, her
meanness, and her determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend
all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and
retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been otherwise
freeand she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake,
that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other
of Mrs. Ferrarss creation, preserved her from all dependence upon her
caprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion.  Or at least, if she
did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edwards being fettered to
Lucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she OUGHT to
have rejoiced.
 
She wondered that Lucys spirits could be so very much elevated by the
civility of Mrs. Ferrarsthat her interest and her vanity should so
very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her
because she was NOT ELINOR, appear a compliment to herselfor to allow
her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her, because
her real situation was unknown.  But that it was so, had not only been
declared by Lucys eyes at the time, but was declared over again the
next morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lady Middleton
set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone,
to tell her how happy she was.
 
The chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon
after she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.
 
"My dear friend," cried Lucy, as soon as they were by themselves, "I
come to talk to you of my happiness.  Could anything be so flattering
as Mrs. Ferrarss way of treating me yesterday?  So exceeding affable
as she was!You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing herbut
the very moment I was introduced, there was such an affability in her
behaviour as really should seem to say, she had quite took a fancy to
me.  Now was not it so? You saw it all and was not you quite struck
with it?"
 
"She was certainly very civil to you."
 
"Civil!Did you see nothing but only civility? I saw a vast deal
more.  Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!No pride,
no hauteur, and your sister just the sameall sweetness and
affability!"
 
Elinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still pressed her to
own that she had reason for her happiness and Elinor was obliged to go
on.
 
"Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement," said she, "nothing
could be more flattering than their treatment of youbut as that was
not the case"
 
"I guessed you would say so,"replied Lucy quickly"but there was no
reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she did
not, and her liking me is every thing.  You shant talk me out of my
satisfaction.  I am sure it will all end well, and there will be no
difficulties at all, to what I used to think.  Mrs. Ferrars is a
charming woman, and so is your sister.  They are both delightful women,
indeed!I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs.
Dashwood was!"
 
To this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not attempt any.
 
"Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?you seem lowyou dont speaksure you
ant well."
 
"I never was in better health."
 
"I am glad of it with all my heart but really you did not look it.  I
should be sorry to have YOU ill you, that have been the greatest
comfort to me in the world!Heaven knows what I should have done
without your friendship."
 
Elinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting her own success.
But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she directly replied,
 
"Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me, and next to
Edwards love, it is the greatest comfort I have.Poor Edward!But
now there is one good thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty
often, for Lady Middletons delighted with Mrs. Dashwood, so we shall
be a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say, and Edward spends half his
time with his sisterbesides, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will
visit nowand Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say
more than once, they should always be glad to see me. They are such
charming women!I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of
her, you cannot speak too high."
 
But Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she SHOULD
tell her sister.  Lucy continued.
 
"I am sure I should have seen it in a moment, if Mrs. Ferrars had took
a dislike to me.  If she had only made me a formal courtesy, for
instance, without saying a word, and never after had took any notice of
me, and never looked at me in a pleasant wayyou know what I meanif
I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way, I should have gave
it all up in despair.  I could not have stood it.  For where she DOES
dislike, I know it is most violent."
 
Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph, by
the doors being thrown open, the servants announcing Mr. Ferrars, and
Edwards immediately walking in.
 
It was a very awkward moment and the countenance of each shewed that
it was so.  They all looked exceedingly foolish and Edward seemed to
have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again, as to
advance farther into it.  The very circumstance, in its unpleasantest
form, which they would each have been most anxious to avoid, had fallen
on them.They were not only all three together, but were together
without the relief of any other person.  The ladies recovered
themselves first.  It was not Lucys business to put herself forward,
and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up.  She could
therefore only LOOK her tenderness, and after slightly addressing him,
said no more.
 
But Elinor had more to do and so anxious was she, for his sake and her
own, to do it well, that she forced herself, after a moments
recollection, to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost
easy, and almost open and another struggle, another effort still
improved them.  She would not allow the presence of Lucy, nor the
consciousness of some injustice towards herself, to deter her from
saying that she was happy to see him, and that she had very much
regretted being from home, when he called before in Berkeley Street.
She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which, as
a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the observant eyes of
Lucy, though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her.
 
Her manners gave some reassurance to Edward, and he had courage enough
to sit down but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in
a proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his sex might
make it rare for his heart had not the indifference of Lucys, nor
could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinors.
 
Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make no
contribution to the comfort of the others, and would not say a word
and almost every thing that WAS said, proceeded from Elinor, who was
obliged to volunteer all the information about her mothers health,
their coming to town, c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,
but never did.
 
Her exertions did not stop here for she soon afterwards felt herself
so heroically disposed as to determine, under pretence of fetching
Marianne, to leave the others by themselves and she really did it, and
THAT in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away several minutes on
the landingplace, with the most highminded fortitude, before she went
to her sister.  When that was once done, however, it was time for the
raptures of Edward to cease for Mariannes joy hurried her into the
drawingroom immediately.  Her pleasure in seeing him was like every
other of her feelings, strong in itself, and strongly spoken.  She met
him with a hand that would be taken, and a voice that expressed the
affection of a sister.
 
"Dear Edward!" she cried, "this is a moment of great happiness!This
would almost make amends for every thing?"
 
Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved, but before such
witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt.  Again they all
sat down, and for a moment or two all were silent while Marianne was
looking with the most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and
sometimes at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each other
should be checked by Lucys unwelcome presence.  Edward was the first
to speak, and it was to notice Mariannes altered looks, and express
his fear of her not finding London agree with her.
 
"Oh, dont think of me!" she replied with spirited earnestness, though
her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke, "dont think of MY
health.  Elinor is well, you see.  That must be enough for us both."
 
This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy, nor
to conciliate the good will of Lucy, who looked up at Marianne with no
very benignant expression.
 
"Do you like London?" said Edward, willing to say any thing that might
introduce another subject.
 
"Not at all.  I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none.
The sight of you, Edward, is the only comfort it has afforded and
thank Heaven! you are what you always were!"
 
She pausedno one spoke.
 
"I think, Elinor," she presently added, "we must employ Edward to take
care of us in our return to Barton.  In a week or two, I suppose, we
shall be going and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to
accept the charge."
 
Poor Edward muttered something, but what it was, nobody knew, not even
himself.  But Marianne, who saw his agitation, and could easily trace
it to whatever cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied, and
soon talked of something else.
 
"We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday!  So dull, so
wretchedly dull!But I have much to say to you on that head, which
cannot be said now."
 
And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her
finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever, and of her
being particularly disgusted with his mother, till they were more in
private.
 
"But why were you not there, Edward?Why did you not come?"
 
"I was engaged elsewhere."
 
"Engaged!  But what was that, when such friends were to be met?"
 
"Perhaps, Miss Marianne," cried Lucy, eager to take some revenge on
her, "you think young men never stand upon engagements, if they have no
mind to keep them, little as well as great."
 
Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the
sting for she calmly replied,
 
"Not so, indeed for, seriously speaking, I am very sure that
conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street.  And I really believe
he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world the most scrupulous
in performing every engagement, however minute, and however it may make
against his interest or pleasure.  He is the most fearful of giving
pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish,
of any body I ever saw.  Edward, it is so, and I will say it.  What!
are you never to hear yourself praised!Then you must be no friend of
mine for those who will accept of my love and esteem, must submit to
my open commendation."
 
The nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happened
to be particularly illsuited to the feelings of two thirds of her
auditors, and was so very unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon
got up to go away.
 
"Going so soon!" said Marianne "my dear Edward, this must not be."
 
And drawing him a little aside, she whispered her persuasion that Lucy
could not stay much longer.  But even this encouragement failed, for he
would go and Lucy, who would have outstaid him, had his visit lasted
two hours, soon afterwards went away.
 
"What can bring her here so often?" said Marianne, on her leaving them.
"Could not she see that we wanted her gone!how teazing to Edward!"
 
"Why so?we were all his friends, and Lucy has been the longest known
to him of any.  It is but natural that he should like to see her as
well as ourselves."
 
Marianne looked at her steadily, and said, "You know, Elinor, that this
is a kind of talking which I cannot bear.  If you only hope to have
your assertion contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case, you
ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it.  I
cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are not really
wanted."
 
She then left the room and Elinor dared not follow her to say more,
for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy, she could give
no information that would convince Marianne and painful as the
consequences of her still continuing in an error might be, she was
obliged to submit to it.  All that she could hope, was that Edward
would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing
Mariannes mistaken warmth, nor to the repetition of any other part of
the pain that had attended their recent meetingand this she had every
reason to expect.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 36
 
 
Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the
world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. was safely delivered of a
son and heir a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least
to all those intimate connections who knew it before.
 
This event, highly important to Mrs. Jenningss happiness, produced a
temporary alteration in the disposal of her time, and influenced, in a
like degree, the engagements of her young friends for as she wished to
be as much as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every morning as
soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late in the evening
and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the Middletons,
spent the whole of every day in Conduit Street. For their own comfort
they would much rather have remained, at least all the morning, in Mrs.
Jenningss house but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes
of everybody. Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton and
the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in fact was as little
valued, as it was professedly sought.
 
They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former and
by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on
THEIR ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize.
Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middletons behaviour to
Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.  Because they
neither flattered herself nor her children, she could not believe them
goodnatured and because they were fond of reading, she fancied them
satirical perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical
but THAT did not signify.  It was censure in common use, and easily
given.
 
Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy.  It checked the
idleness of one, and the business of the other.  Lady Middleton was
ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was
proud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they would
despise her for offering.  Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the
three, by their presence and it was in their power to reconcile her to
it entirely.  Would either of them only have given her a full and
minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby,
she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the
best place by the fire after dinner, which their arrival occasioned.
But this conciliation was not granted for though she often threw out
expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt
a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect was
produced, but a look of indifference from the former, or of disgust in
the latter.  An effort even yet lighter might have made her their
friend.  Would they only have laughed at her about the Doctor!  But so
little were they, anymore than the others, inclined to oblige her, that
if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a whole day without
hearing any other raillery on the subject, than what she was kind
enough to bestow on herself.
 
All these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totally
unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought it a delightful thing
for the girls to be together and generally congratulated her young
friends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid old
woman so long.  She joined them sometimes at Sir Johns, sometimes at
her own house but wherever it was, she always came in excellent
spirits, full of delight and importance, attributing Charlottes well
doing to her own care, and ready to give so exact, so minute a detail
of her situation, as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.
One thing DID disturb her and of that she made her daily complaint.
Mr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his sex,
of all infants being alike and though she could plainly perceive, at
different times, the most striking resemblance between this baby and
every one of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing his
father of it no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like
every other baby of the same age nor could he even be brought to
acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the
world.
 
I come now to the relation of a misfortune, which about this time
befell Mrs. John Dashwood.  It so happened that while her two sisters
with Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street, another
of her acquaintance had dropt ina circumstance in itself not
apparently likely to produce evil to her.  But while the imaginations
of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our
conduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, ones happiness
must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance.  In the present
instance, this lastarrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun
truth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss
Dashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwoods sisters, she
immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street and this
misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of
invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a small
musical party at her house.  The consequence of which was, that Mrs.
John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great
inconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what
was still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing
to treat them with attention and who could tell that they might not
expect to go out with her a second time?  The power of disappointing
them, it was true, must always be hers.  But that was not enough for
when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be
wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from
them.
 
Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of
going out every day, that it was become a matter of indifference to
her, whether she went or not and she prepared quietly and mechanically
for every evenings engagement, though without expecting the smallest
amusement from any, and very often without knowing, till the last
moment, where it was to take her.
 
To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent, as
not to bestow half the consideration on it, during the whole of her
toilet, which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes of
their being together, when it was finished.  Nothing escaped HER minute
observation and general curiosity she saw every thing, and asked every
thing was never easy till she knew the price of every part of
Mariannes dress could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether
with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not without hopes
of finding out before they parted, how much her washing cost per week,
and how much she had every year to spend upon herself.  The
impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generally
concluded with a compliment, which though meant as its douceur, was
considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all for after
undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown, the
colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair, she was almost
sure of being told that upon "her word she looked vastly smart, and she
dared to say she would make a great many conquests."
 
With such encouragement as this, was she dismissed on the present
occasion, to her brothers carriage which they were ready to enter
five minutes after it stopped at the door, a punctuality not very
agreeable to their sisterinlaw, who had preceded them to the house of
her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay on their part
that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman.
 
The events of this evening were not very remarkable.  The party, like
other musical parties, comprehended a great many people who had real
taste for the performance, and a great many more who had none at all
and the performers themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,
and that of their immediate friends, the first private performers in
England.
 
As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so, she made no
scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte, whenever it
suited her, and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp, and
violoncello, would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the
room.  In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of
young men, the very he, who had given them a lecture on toothpickcases
at Grays.  She perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself, and
speaking familiarly to her brother and had just determined to find out
his name from the latter, when they both came towards her, and Mr.
Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert Ferrars.
 
He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted his head into a bow
which assured her as plainly as words could have done, that he was
exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy.  Happy
had it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended less on his
own merit, than on the merit of his nearest relations!  For then his
brothers bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the
illhumour of his mother and sister would have begun.  But while she
wondered at the difference of the two young men, she did not find that
the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out of all charity with
the modesty and worth of the other.  Why they WERE different, Robert
exclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hours
conversation for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme
GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper
society, he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any
natural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education
while he himself, though probably without any particular, any material
superiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,
was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.
 
"Upon my soul," he added, "I believe it is nothing more and so I often
tell my mother, when she is grieving about it.  My dear Madam, I
always say to her, you must make yourself easy.  The evil is now
irremediable, and it has been entirely your own doing.  Why would you
be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your own judgment, to
place Edward under private tuition, at the most critical time of his
life?  If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself,
instead of sending him to Mr. Pratts, all this would have been
prevented. This is the way in which I always consider the matter, and
my mother is perfectly convinced of her error."
 
Elinor would not oppose his opinion, because, whatever might be her
general estimation of the advantage of a public school, she could not
think of Edwards abode in Mr. Pratts family, with any satisfaction.
 
"You reside in Devonshire, I think,"was his next observation, "in a
cottage near Dawlish."
 
Elinor set him right as to its situation and it seemed rather
surprising to him that anybody could live in Devonshire, without living
near Dawlish.  He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their
species of house.
 
"For my own part," said he, "I am excessively fond of a cottage there
is always so much comfort, so much elegance about them.  And I protest,
if I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build one
myself, within a short distance of London, where I might drive myself
down at any time, and collect a few friends about me, and be happy.  I
advise every body who is going to build, to build a cottage.  My friend
Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,
and laid before me three different plans of Bonomis.  I was to decide
on the best of them.  My dear Courtland, said I, immediately throwing
them all into the fire, do not adopt either of them, but by all means
build a cottage. And that I fancy, will be the end of it.
 
"Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations, no space in a
cottage but this is all a mistake.  I was last month at my friend
Elliotts, near Dartford.  Lady Elliott wished to give a dance.  But
how can it be done? said she my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it is
to be managed.  There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten
couple, and where can the supper be? I immediately saw that there
could be no difficulty in it, so I said, My dear Lady Elliott, do not
be uneasy.  The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease
cardtables may be placed in the drawingroom the library may be open
for tea and other refreshments and let the supper be set out in the
saloon.  Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought.  We measured the
diningroom, and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the
affair was arranged precisely after my plan.  So that, in fact, you
see, if people do but know how to set about it, every comfort may be as
well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling."
 
Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the
compliment of rational opposition.
 
As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister,
his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else and a thought
struck him during the evening, which he communicated to his wife, for
her approbation, when they got home.  The consideration of Mrs.
Dennisons mistake, in supposing his sisters their guests, had
suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such,
while Mrs. Jenningss engagements kept her from home.  The expense would
be nothing, the inconvenience not more and it was altogether an
attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be
requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his
father.  Fanny was startled at the proposal.
 
"I do not see how it can be done," said she, "without affronting Lady
Middleton, for they spend every day with her otherwise I should be
exceedingly glad to do it.  You know I am always ready to pay them any
attention in my power, as my taking them out this evening shews.  But
they are Lady Middletons visitors.  How can I ask them away from her?"
 
Her husband, but with great humility, did not see the force of her
objection.  "They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit
Street, and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the
same number of days to such near relations."
 
Fanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said,
 
"My love I would ask them with all my heart, if it was in my power.
But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a
few days with us.  They are very well behaved, good kind of girls and
I think the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very well
by Edward.  We can ask your sisters some other year, you know but the
Miss Steeles may not be in town any more.  I am sure you will like
them indeed, you DO like them, you know, very much already, and so
does my mother and they are such favourites with Harry!"
 
Mr. Dashwood was convinced.  He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss
Steeles immediately, and his conscience was pacified by the resolution
of inviting his sisters another year at the same time, however, slyly
suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless, by
bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandons wife, and Marianne as
THEIR visitor.
 
Fanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready wit that had
procured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy, to request her company and
her sisters, for some days, in Harley Street, as soon as Lady
Middleton could spare them.  This was enough to make Lucy really and
reasonably happy.  Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her,
herself cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views!  Such
an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was, above all
things, the most material to her interest, and such an invitation the
most gratifying to her feelings!  It was an advantage that could not be
too gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of and the
visit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had any precise limits,
was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days
time.
 
When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten minutes after
its arrival, it gave her, for the first time, some share in the
expectations of Lucy for such a mark of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed
on so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the goodwill
towards her arose from something more than merely malice against
herself and might be brought, by time and address, to do every thing
that Lucy wished.  Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady
Middleton, and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John
Dashwood and these were effects that laid open the probability of
greater.
 
The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all that reached Elinor
of their influence there, strengthened her expectation of the event.
Sir John, who called on them more than once, brought home such accounts
of the favour they were in, as must be universally striking.  Mrs.
Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her
life, as she was with them had given each of them a needle book made
by some emigrant called Lucy by her Christian name and did not know
whether she should ever be able to part with them.
 
 
 
 
 
At this point in the first and second editions, Volume II ended.
 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 37
 
 
Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight, that her mother felt
it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her and,
contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day, returned from
that period to her own home, and her own habits, in which she found the
Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share.
 
About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in
Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings, on returning from her ordinary visit to
Mrs. Palmer, entered the drawingroom, where Elinor was sitting by
herself, with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to
hear something wonderful and giving her time only to form that idea,
began directly to justify it, by saying,
 
"Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?"
 
"No, maam.  What is it?"
 
"Something so strange!  But you shall hear it all. When I got to Mr.
Palmers, I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child.  She was
sure it was very illit cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.
So I looked at it directly, and, Lord! my dear, says I, it is
nothing in the world, but the red gum and nurse said just the same.
But Charlotte, she would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for
and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he
stepped over directly, and as soon as ever Mama, he said
just as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, and
then Charlotte was easy.  And so, just as he was going away again, it
came into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of
it, but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news.  So upon
that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to know
something or other, and at last he said in a whisper, For fear any
unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to
their sisters indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that I
believe there is no great reason for alarm I hope Mrs. Dashwood will
do very well."
 
"What! is Fanny ill?"
 
"That is exactly what I said, my dear.  Lord! says I, is Mrs.
Dashwood ill? So then it all came out and the long and the short of
the matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this.  Mr. Edward Ferrars,
the very young man I used to joke with you about but however, as it
turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it, Mr.
Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my
cousin Lucy!Theres for you, my dear!And not a creature knowing a
syllable of the matter, except Nancy!Could you have believed such a
thing possible? There is no great wonder in their liking one another
but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody
suspect it!THAT is strange!I never happened to see them together,
or I am sure I should have found it out directly.  Well, and so this
was kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor
your brother or sister suspected a word of the mattertill this very
morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a wellmeaning creature, but no
conjurer, popt it all out.  Lord! thinks she to herself, they are
all so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it
and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone at her
carpetwork, little suspecting what was to comefor she had just been
saying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she thought to
make a match between Edward and some Lords daughter or other, I forget
who.  So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride.
She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with such screams as
reached your brothers ears, as he was sitting in his own dressingroom
down stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the
country.  So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, for
Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming what was going on.
Poor soul!  I pity HER.  And I must say, I think she was used very
hardly for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon drove her into
a fainting fit.  Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly
and your brother, he walked about the room, and said he did not know
what to do.  Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute
longer in the house, and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS
knees too, to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up
their clothes.  THEN she fell into hysterics again, and he was so
frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan found
the house in all this uproar.  The carriage was at the door ready to
take my poor cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he came
off poor Lucy in such a condition, he says, she could hardly walk and
Nancy, she was almost as bad.  I declare, I have no patience with your
sister and I hope, with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of
her.  Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of
it!  To have his love used so scornfully! for they say he is monstrous
fond of her, as well he may.  I should not wonder, if he was to be in
the greatest passion!and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same.  He and I
had a great deal of talk about it and the best of all is, that he is
gone back again to Harley Street, that he may be within call when Mrs.
Ferrars is told of it, for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins
left the house, for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too
and so she may, for what I care.  I have no pity for either of them.  I
have no notion of peoples making such a todo about money and
greatness.  There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should
not marry for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her
son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself, she knows better than
any body how to make the most of every thing I dare say, if Mrs.
Ferrars would only allow him five hundred ayear, she would make as
good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight.  Lord!
how snug they might live in such another cottage as yoursor a little
biggerwith two maids, and two men and I believe I could help them to
a housemaid, for my Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit
them exactly."
 
Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had time enough to collect
her thoughts, she was able to give such an answer, and make such
observations, as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce.
Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest
in it that Mrs. Jennings as she had of late often hoped might be the
case had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward and happy
above all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she felt very well able
to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to give her judgment,
as she believed, with impartiality on the conduct of every one
concerned in it.
 
She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really
was though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being
possible to end otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and
Lucy.  What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could not be a
doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear and still more anxious to
know how Edward would conduct himself.  For HIM she felt much
compassionfor Lucy very littleand it cost her some pains to
procure that littlefor the rest of the party none at all.
 
As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject, Elinor soon saw the
necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion.  No time was to be
lost in undeceiving her, in making her acquainted with the real truth,
and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others,
without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister, or any
resentment against Edward.
 
Elinors office was a painful one.She was going to remove what she
really believed to be her sisters chief consolation,to give such
particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good
opinion,and to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,
which to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her own disappointment
over again.  But unwelcome as such a task must be, it was necessary to
be done, and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it.
 
She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings, or to
represent herself as suffering much, any otherwise than as the
selfcommand she had practised since her first knowledge of Edwards
engagement, might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.
Her narration was clear and simple and though it could not be given
without emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, nor
impetuous grief.THAT belonged rather to the hearer, for Marianne
listened with horror, and cried excessively.  Elinor was to be the
comforter of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs and
all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure
of mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but
of imprudence, was readily offered.
 
But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither.  Edward seemed
a second Willoughby and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she HAD
loved him most sincerely, could she feel less than herself!  As for
Lucy Steele, she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely
incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could not be persuaded
at first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection of
Edward for her.  She would not even admit it to have been natural and
Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so, by that which only
could convince her, a better knowledge of mankind.
 
Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact
of the engagement, and the length of time it had existed.Mariannes
feelings had then broken in, and put an end to all regularity of
detail and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her
distress, lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment.  The first
question on her side, which led to farther particulars, was,
 
"How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has he written to you?"
 
"I have known it these four months.  When Lucy first came to Barton
Park last November, she told me in confidence of her engagement."
 
At these words, Mariannes eyes expressed the astonishment which her
lips could not utter.  After a pause of wonder, she exclaimed
 
"Four months!Have you known of this four months?"
 
Elinor confirmed it.
 
"What!while attending me in all my misery, has this been on your
heart?And I have reproached you for being happy!"
 
"It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse!"
 
"Four months!"cried Marianne again."So calm!so cheerful!how
have you been supported?"
 
"By feeling that I was doing my duty.My promise to Lucy, obliged me
to be secret.  I owed it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of
the truth and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in
them a solicitude about me, which it could not be in my power to
satisfy."
 
Marianne seemed much struck.
 
"I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother," added
Elinor "and once or twice I have attempted itbut without betraying
my trust, I never could have convinced you."
 
"Four months!and yet you loved him!"
 
"Yes. But I did not love only himand while the comfort of others was
dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt.
Now, I can think and speak of it with little emotion.  I would not have
you suffer on my account for I assure you I no longer suffer
materially myself.  I have many things to support me.  I am not
conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my
own, I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther.
I acquit Edward of essential misconduct.  I wish him very happy and I
am so sure of his always doing his duty, that though now he may harbour
some regret, in the end he must become so.  Lucy does not want sense,
and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.And
after all, Marianne, after all that is bewitching in the idea of a
single and constant attachment, and all that can be said of ones
happiness depending entirely on any particular person, it is not
meantit is not fitit is not possible that it should be so. Edward
will marry Lucy he will marry a woman superior in person and
understanding to half her sex and time and habit will teach him to
forget that he ever thought another superior to HER."
 
"If such is your way of thinking," said Marianne, "if the loss of what
is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, your
resolution, your selfcommand, are, perhaps, a little less to be
wondered at.They are brought more within my comprehension."
 
"I understand you.You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.For
four months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without
being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature knowing that it
would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to
you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least. It was told
me,it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose
prior engagement ruined all my prospects and told me, as I thought,
with triumph. This persons suspicions, therefore, I have had to
oppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most
deeply interestedand it has not been only onceI have had her
hopes and exultation to listen to again and again. I have known
myself to be divided from Edward for ever, without hearing one
circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.Nothing
has proved him unworthy nor has anything declared him indifferent to
me. I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister, and
the insolence of his mother and have suffered the punishment of an
attachment, without enjoying its advantages. And all this has been
going on at a time, when, as you know too well, it has not been my only
unhappiness. If you can think me capable of ever feelingsurely you
may suppose that I have suffered NOW.  The composure of mind with which
I have brought myself at present to consider the matter, the
consolation that I have been willing to admit, have been the effect of
constant and painful exertionthey did not spring up of
themselvesthey did not occur to relieve my spirits at first. No,
Marianne.THEN, if I had not been bound to silence, perhaps nothing
could have kept me entirelynot even what I owed to my dearest
friendsfrom openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy."
 
Marianne was quite subdued.
 
"Oh! Elinor," she cried, "you have made me hate myself for ever.How
barbarous have I been to you!you, who have been my only comfort, who
have borne with me in all my misery, who have seemed to be only
suffering for me!Is this my gratitude?Is this the only return I can
make you?Because your merit cries out upon myself, I have been trying
to do it away."
 
The tenderest caresses followed this confession.  In such a frame of
mind as she was now in, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her
whatever promise she required and at her request, Marianne engaged
never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of
bitternessto meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of
dislike to herand even to see Edward himself, if chance should bring
them together, without any diminution of her usual cordiality. These
were great concessionsbut where Marianne felt that she had injured,
no reparation could be too much for her to make.
 
She performed her promise of being discreet, to admiration.She
attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with an
unchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heard
three times to say, "Yes, maam."She listened to her praise of Lucy
with only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jennings
talked of Edwards affection, it cost her only a spasm in her
throat.Such advances towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel
equal to any thing herself.
 
The next morning brought a farther trial of it, in a visit from their
brother, who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful
affair, and bring them news of his wife.
 
"You have heard, I suppose," said he with great solemnity, as soon as
he was seated, "of the very shocking discovery that took place under
our roof yesterday."
 
They all looked their assent it seemed too awful a moment for speech.
 
"Your sister," he continued, "has suffered dreadfully.  Mrs. Ferrars
tooin short it has been a scene of such complicated distressbut I
will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us
quite overcome.  Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday.  But I
would not alarm you too much.  Donavan says there is nothing materially
to be apprehended her constitution is a good one, and her resolution
equal to any thing.  She has borne it all, with the fortitude of an
angel!  She says she never shall think well of anybody again and one
cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!meeting with such
ingratitude, where so much kindness had been shewn, so much confidence
had been placed!  It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart,
that she had asked these young women to her house merely because she
thought they deserved some attention, were harmless, wellbehaved
girls, and would be pleasant companions for otherwise we both wished
very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us, while your
kind friend there, was attending her daughter.  And now to be so
rewarded!  I wish, with all my heart, says poor Fanny in her
affectionate way, that we had asked your sisters instead of them."
 
Here he stopped to be thanked which being done, he went on.
 
"What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny broke it to her, is
not to be described.  While she with the truest affection had been
planning a most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed that
he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!such a
suspicion could never have entered her head!  If she suspected ANY
prepossession elsewhere, it could not be in THAT quarter.  THERE, to
be sure, said she, I might have thought myself safe. She was quite
in an agony.  We consulted together, however, as to what should be
done, and at last she determined to send for Edward.  He came.  But I
am sorry to relate what ensued.  All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to
make him put an end to the engagement, assisted too as you may well
suppose by my arguments, and Fannys entreaties, was of no avail.
Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded.  I never thought Edward
so stubborn, so unfeeling before.  His mother explained to him her
liberal designs, in case of his marrying Miss Morton told him she
would settle on him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of landtax,
brings in a good thousand ayear offered even, when matters grew
desperate, to make it twelve hundred and in opposition to this, if he
still persisted in this low connection, represented to him the certain
penury that must attend the match.  His own two thousand pounds she
protested should be his all she would never see him again and so far
would she be from affording him the smallest assistance, that if he
were to enter into any profession with a view of better support, she
would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it."
 
Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation, clapped her hands
together, and cried, "Gracious God!  can this be possible!"
 
"Well may you wonder, Marianne," replied her brother, "at the obstinacy
which could resist such arguments as these.  Your exclamation is very
natural."
 
Marianne was going to retort, but she remembered her promises, and
forbore.
 
"All this, however," he continued, "was urged in vain.  Edward said
very little but what he did say, was in the most determined manner.
Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement.  He would
stand to it, cost him what it might."
 
"Then," cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity, no longer able to be
silent, "he has acted like an honest man! I beg your pardon, Mr.
Dashwood, but if he had done otherwise, I should have thought him a
rascal.  I have some little concern in the business, as well as
yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is not a
better kind of girl in the world, nor one who more deserves a good
husband."
 
John Dashwood was greatly astonished but his nature was calm, not open
to provocation, and he never wished to offend anybody, especially
anybody of good fortune.  He therefore replied, without any resentment,
 
"I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours,
madam.  Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say, a very deserving young woman,
but in the present case you know, the connection must be impossible.
And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her
uncles care, the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune
as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In
short, I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom
you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings.  We all wish her extremely happy
and Mrs. Ferrarss conduct throughout the whole, has been such as every
conscientious, good mother, in like circumstances, would adopt.  It has
been dignified and liberal.  Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear
it will be a bad one."
 
Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension and Elinors heart wrung
for the feelings of Edward, while braving his mothers threats, for a
woman who could not reward him.
 
"Well, sir," said Mrs. Jennings, "and how did it end?"
 
"I am sorry to say, maam, in a most unhappy rupture Edward is
dismissed for ever from his mothers notice.  He left her house
yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether he is still in town, I do
not know for WE of course can make no inquiry."
 
"Poor young man!and what is to become of him?"
 
"What, indeed, maam!  It is a melancholy consideration.  Born to the
prospect of such affluence!  I cannot conceive a situation more
deplorable.  The interest of two thousand poundshow can a man live on
it?and when to that is added the recollection, that he might, but for
his own folly, within three months have been in the receipt of two
thousand, five hundred ayear for Miss Morton has thirty thousand
pounds, I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition.  We must
all feel for him and the more so, because it is totally out of our
power to assist him."
 
"Poor young man!" cried Mrs. Jennings, "I am sure he should be very
welcome to bed and board at my house and so I would tell him if I
could see him.  It is not fit that he should be living about at his own
charge now, at lodgings and taverns."
 
Elinors heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward, though she
could not forbear smiling at the form of it.
 
"If he would only have done as well by himself," said John Dashwood,
"as all his friends were disposed to do by him, he might now have been
in his proper situation, and would have wanted for nothing.  But as it
is, it must be out of anybodys power to assist him.  And there is one
thing more preparing against him, which must be worse than allhis
mother has determined, with a very natural kind of spirit, to settle
THAT estate upon Robert immediately, which might have been Edwards, on
proper conditions.  I left her this morning with her lawyer, talking
over the business."
 
"Well!" said Mrs. Jennings, "that is HER revenge.  Everybody has a way
of their own.  But I dont think mine would be, to make one son
independent, because another had plagued me."
 
Marianne got up and walked about the room.
 
"Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man," continued John,
"than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might
have been his own?  Poor Edward!  I feel for him sincerely."
 
A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion, concluded his
visit and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really
believed there was no material danger in Fannys indisposition, and
that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away
leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present
occasion, as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrarss conduct, the
Dashwoods, and Edwards.
 
Mariannes indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room and
as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in
Mrs. Jennings, they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the
party.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 38
 
 
Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edwards conduct, but only
Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit.  THEY only knew how
little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient, and how small was the
consolation, beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could remain
to him in the loss of friends and fortune.  Elinor gloried in his
integrity and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for his
punishment.  But though confidence between them was, by this public
discovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on which
either of them were fond of dwelling when alone.  Elinor avoided it
upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts, by the
too warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edwards
continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away and
Mariannes courage soon failed her, in trying to converse upon a topic
which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the
comparison it necessarily produced between Elinors conduct and her own.
 
She felt all the force of that comparison but not as her sister had
hoped, to urge her to exertion now she felt it with all the pain of
continual selfreproach, regretted most bitterly that she had never
exerted herself before but it brought only the torture of penitence,
without the hope of amendment.  Her mind was so much weakened that she
still fancied present exertion impossible, and therefore it only
dispirited her more.
 
Nothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards, of affairs
in Harley Street, or Bartletts Buildings.  But though so much of the
matter was known to them already, that Mrs. Jennings might have had
enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther, without seeking after
more, she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and
inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could and nothing but the
hindrance of more visitors than usual, had prevented her going to them
within that time.
 
The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars, was so
fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens,
though it was only the second week in March.  Mrs. Jennings and Elinor
were of the number but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were
again in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them, chose rather
to stay at home, than venture into so public a place.
 
An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they
entered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing
with them, and engaging all Mrs. Jenningss conversation, she was
herself left to quiet reflection.  She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,
nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody who could by
any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her.  But at last
she found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who,
though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting
them, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of
Mrs. Jennings, left her own party for a short time, to join theirs.
Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,
 
"Get it all out of her, my dear.  She will tell you any thing if you
ask.  You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke."
 
It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jenningss curiosity and Elinors too,
that she would tell any thing WITHOUT being asked for nothing would
otherwise have been learnt.
 
"I am so glad to meet you" said Miss Steele, taking her familiarly by
the arm"for I wanted to see you of all things in the world."  And
then lowering her voice, "I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about
it.  Is she angry?"
 
"Not at all, I believe, with you."
 
"That is a good thing.  And Lady Middleton, is SHE angry?"
 
"I cannot suppose it possible that she should."
 
"I am monstrous glad of it.  Good gracious!  I have had such a time of
it!  I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life.  She vowed at first
she would never trim me up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me
again, so long as she lived but now she is quite come to, and we are
as good friends as ever.  Look, she made me this bow to my hat, and put
in the feather last night.  There now, YOU are going to laugh at me
too.  But why should not I wear pink ribbons?  I do not care if it IS
the Doctors favourite colour.  I am sure, for my part, I should never
have known he DID like it better than any other colour, if he had not
happened to say so.  My cousins have been so plaguing me!  I declare
sometimes I do not know which way to look before them."
 
She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say,
and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to
the first.
 
"Well, but Miss Dashwood," speaking triumphantly, "people may say what
they chuse about Mr. Ferrarss declaring he would not have Lucy, for it
is no such thing I can tell you and it is quite a shame for such
illnatured reports to be spread abroad.  Whatever Lucy might think
about it herself, you know, it was no business of other people to set
it down for certain."
 
"I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before, I assure you,"
said Elinor.
 
"Oh, did not you?  But it WAS said, I know, very well, and by more than
one for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses could
expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty
thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had nothing at
all and I had it from Miss Sparks myself.  And besides that, my cousin
Richard said himself, that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr.
Ferrars would be off and when Edward did not come near us for three
days, I could not tell what to think myself and I believe in my heart
Lucy gave it up all for lost for we came away from your brothers
Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday, and did not know what was become of him.  Once Lucy thought
to write to him, but then her spirits rose against that.  However this
morning he came just as we came home from church and then it all came
out, how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street, and been
talked to by his mother and all of them, and how he had declared before
them all that he loved nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he
have.  And how he had been so worried by what passed, that as soon as
he had went away from his mothers house, he had got upon his horse,
and rid into the country, some where or other and how he had stayed
about at an inn all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the better
of it.  And after thinking it all over and over again, he said, it
seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune, and no nothing at all, it
would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement, because it must
be for her loss, for he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no
hope of any thing else and if he was to go into orders, as he had some
thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how was they to live
upon that?He could not bear to think of her doing no better, and so
he begged, if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to the
matter directly, and leave him shift for himself.  I heard him say all
this as plain as could possibly be.  And it was entirely for HER sake,
and upon HER account, that he said a word about being off, and not upon
his own.  I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired
of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any thing like it.  But,
to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking so she
told him directly with a great deal about sweet and love, you know,
and all thatOh, la! one cant repeat such kind of things you
knowshe told him directly, she had not the least mind in the world
to be off, for she could live with him upon a trifle, and how little so
ever he might have, she should be very glad to have it all, you know,
or something of the kind.  So then he was monstrous happy, and talked
on some time about what they should do, and they agreed he should take
orders directly, and they must wait to be married till he got a living.
And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin called from
below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach, and would take
one of us to Kensington Gardens so I was forced to go into the room
and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but she did
not care to leave Edward so I just run up stairs and put on a pair of
silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons."
 
"I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them," said Elinor
"you were all in the same room together, were not you?"
 
"No, indeed, not us.  La! Miss Dashwood, do you think people make love
when any body else is by?  Oh, for shame!To be sure you must know
better than that.  Laughing affectedly.No, no they were shut up in
the drawingroom together, and all I heard was only by listening at the
door."
 
"How!" cried Elinor "have you been repeating to me what you only
learnt yourself by listening at the door?  I am sorry I did not know it
before for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me
particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known
yourself.  How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?"
 
"Oh, la! there is nothing in THAT.  I only stood at the door, and heard
what I could.  And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me
for a year or two back, when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets
together, she never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or behind a
chimneyboard, on purpose to hear what we said."
 
Elinor tried to talk of something else but Miss Steele could not be
kept beyond a couple of minutes, from what was uppermost in her mind.
 
"Edward talks of going to Oxford soon," said she "but now he is
lodging at No. , Pall Mall.  What an illnatured woman his mother is,
ant she? And your brother and sister were not very kind! However, I
shant say anything against them to YOU and to be sure they did send
us home in their own chariot, which was more than I looked for.  And
for my part, I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us
for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before but, however,
nothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine out of sight.
Edward have got some business at Oxford, he says so he must go there
for a time and after THAT, as soon as he can light upon a Bishop, he
will be ordained.  I wonder what curacy he will get!Good gracious!
giggling as she spoke Id lay my life I know what my cousins will
say, when they hear of it.  They will tell me I should write to the
Doctor, to get Edward the curacy of his new living.  I know they will
but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the world. La! I
shall say directly, I wonder how you could think of such a thing?  I
write to the Doctor, indeed!"
 
"Well," said Elinor, "it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst.
You have got your answer ready."
 
Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject, but the approach of
her own party made another more necessary.
 
"Oh, la! here come the Richardsons.  I had a vast deal more to say to
you, but I must not stay away from them not any longer.  I assure you
they are very genteel people.  He makes a monstrous deal of money, and
they keep their own coach.  I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings
about it myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not
in anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same and if anything
should happen to take you and your sister away, and Mrs. Jennings
should want company, I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay
with her for as long a time as she likes.  I suppose Lady Middleton
wont ask us any more this bout.  Goodby I am sorry Miss Marianne was
not here.  Remember me kindly to her.  La! if you have not got your
spotted muslin on!I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn."
 
Such was her parting concern for after this, she had time only to pay
her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings, before her company was
claimed by Mrs. Richardson and Elinor was left in possession of
knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time, though
she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and
foreplanned in her own mind.  Edwards marriage with Lucy was as firmly
determined on, and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely
uncertain, as she had concluded it would beevery thing depended,
exactly after her expectation, on his getting that preferment, of
which, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.
 
As soon as they returned to the carriage, Mrs. Jennings was eager for
information but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible
intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained, she
confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars, as
she felt assured that Lucy, for the sake of her own consequence, would
choose to have known.  The continuance of their engagement, and the
means that were able to be taken for promoting its end, was all her
communication and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the following
natural remark.
 
"Wait for his having a living!ay, we all know how THAT will
endthey will wait a twelvemonth, and finding no good comes of it,
will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds ayear, with the interest
of his two thousand pounds, and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr.
Pratt can give her.Then they will have a child every year! and Lord
help em! how poor they will be!I must see what I can give them
towards furnishing their house.  Two maids and two men, indeed!as I
talked of tother day.No, no, they must get a stout girl of all
works. Bettys sister would never do for them NOW."
 
The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the twopenny post from
Lucy herself.  It was as follows
 
                    "Bartletts Building, March.
 
     "I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the
     liberty I take of writing to her but I know your
     friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such
     a good account of myself and my dear Edward, after
     all the troubles we have went through lately,
     therefore will make no more apologies, but proceed
     to say that, thank God! though we have suffered
     dreadfully, we are both quite well now, and as happy
     as we must always be in one anothers love.  We have
     had great trials, and great persecutions, but
     however, at the same time, gratefully acknowledge
     many friends, yourself not the least among them,
     whose great kindness I shall always thankfully
     remember, as will Edward too, who I have told of
     it.  I am sure you will be glad to hear, as likewise
     dear Mrs. Jennings, I spent two happy hours with
     him yesterday afternoon, he would not hear of our
     parting, though earnestly did I, as I thought my
     duty required, urge him to it for prudence sake,
     and would have parted for ever on the spot, would
     he consent to it but he said it should never be,
     he did not regard his mothers anger, while he could
     have my affections our prospects are not very
     bright, to be sure, but we must wait, and hope for
     the best he will be ordained shortly and should
     it ever be in your power to recommend him to any
     body that has a living to bestow, am very sure you
     will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings too,
     trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John,
     or Mr. Palmer, or any friend that may be able to
     assist us.Poor Anne was much to blame for what
     she did, but she did it for the best, so I say
     nothing hope Mrs. Jennings wont think it too much
     trouble to give us a call, should she come this way
     any morning, twould be a great kindness, and my
     cousins would be proud to know her.My paper reminds
     me to conclude and begging to be most gratefully
     and respectfully remembered to her, and to Sir John,
     and Lady Middleton, and the dear children, when you
     chance to see them, and love to Miss Marianne,
 
                                      "I am, c."
 
As soon as Elinor had finished it, she performed what she concluded to
be its writers real design, by placing it in the hands of Mrs.
Jennings, who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and
praise.
 
"Very well indeed!how prettily she writes!aye, that was quite
proper to let him be off if he would.  That was just like Lucy.Poor
soul! I wish I COULD get him a living, with all my heart.She calls me
dear Mrs. Jennings, you see.  She is a goodhearted girl as ever
lived.Very well upon my word.  That sentence is very prettily turned.
Yes, yes, I will go and see her, sure enough.  How attentive she is, to
think of every body!Thank you, my dear, for shewing it me.  It is as
pretty a letter as ever I saw, and does Lucys head and heart great
credit."
 
 
 
CHAPTER 39
 
 
The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town,
and Mariannes impatience to be gone increased every day.  She sighed
for the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country and fancied that if
any place could give her ease, Barton must do it.  Elinor was hardly
less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less bent
on its being effected immediately, as that she was conscious of the
difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be brought
to acknowledge.  She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts
towards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes to
their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of her
goodwill, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining them from
home yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more
eligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about
the end of March, for the Easter holidays and Mrs. Jennings, with both
her friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with
them.  This would not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy
of Miss Dashwoodbut it was inforced with so much real politeness by
Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very great amendment of his
manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy,
induced her to accept it with pleasure.
 
When she told Marianne what she had done, however, her first reply was
not very auspicious.
 
"Cleveland!"she cried, with great agitation.  "No, I cannot go to
Cleveland."
 
"You forget," said Elinor gently, "that its situation is not...that it
is not in the neighbourhood of..."
 
"But it is in Somersetshire.I cannot go into Somersetshire.There,
where I looked forward to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to
go there."
 
Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such
feelingsshe only endeavoured to counteract them by working on
othersrepresented it, therefore, as a measure which would fix the
time of her returning to that dear mother, whom she so much wished to
see, in a more eligible, more comfortable manner, than any other plan
could do, and perhaps without any greater delay.  From Cleveland, which
was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not
beyond one day, though a long days journey and their mothers servant
might easily come there to attend them down and as there could be no
occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be
at home in little more than three weeks time.  As Mariannes affection
for her mother was sincere, it must triumph with little difficulty,
over the imaginary evils she had started.
 
Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guests, that she
pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland.
Elinor was grateful for the attention, but it could not alter her
design and their mothers concurrence being readily gained, every
thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could beand
Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that
were yet to divide her from Barton.
 
"Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss
Dashwoods"was Mrs. Jenningss address to him when he first called on
her, after their leaving her was settled"for they are quite resolved
upon going home from the Palmersand how forlorn we shall be, when I
come back!Lord! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two
cats."
 
Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous sketch of their
future ennui, to provoke him to make that offer, which might give
himself an escape from itand if so, she had soon afterwards good
reason to think her object gained for, on Elinors moving to the
window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print, which she
was going to copy for her friend, he followed her to it with a look of
particular meaning, and conversed with her there for several minutes.
The effect of his discourse on the lady too, could not escape her
observation, for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even
changed her seat, on purpose that she might NOT hear, to one close by
the piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she could not keep
herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended with
agitation, and was too intent on what he said to pursue her
employment. Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the
interval of Mariannes turning from one lesson to another, some words
of the Colonels inevitably reached her ear, in which he seemed to be
apologising for the badness of his house.  This set the matter beyond a
doubt.  She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary to do so
but supposed it to be the proper etiquette.  What Elinor said in reply
she could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips, that
she did not think THAT any material objectionand Mrs. Jennings
commended her in her heart for being so honest.  They then talked on
for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable, when another
lucky stop in Mariannes performance brought her these words in the
Colonels calm voice,
 
"I am afraid it cannot take place very soon."
 
Astonished and shocked at so unloverlike a speech, she was almost
ready to cry out, "Lord! what should hinder it?"but checking her
desire, confined herself to this silent ejaculation.
 
"This is very strange!sure he need not wait to be older."
 
This delay on the Colonels side, however, did not seem to offend or
mortify his fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up the
conference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings
very plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which shewed her to
feel what she said,
 
"I shall always think myself very much obliged to you."
 
Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude, and only wondered that
after hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be able to take leave
of them, as he immediately did, with the utmost sangfroid, and go away
without making her any reply!She had not thought her old friend could
have made so indifferent a suitor.
 
What had really passed between them was to this effect.
 
"I have heard," said he, with great compassion, "of the injustice your
friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family for if I understand
the matter right, he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering
in his engagement with a very deserving young woman. Have I been
rightly informed?Is it so?"
 
Elinor told him that it was.
 
"The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,"he replied, with great
feeling,"of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people long
attached to each other, is terrible. Mrs. Ferrars does not know what
she may be doingwhat she may drive her son to.  I have seen Mr.
Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased with
him.  He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted
in a short time, but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his
own sake, and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more.  I understand
that he intends to take orders.  Will you be so good as to tell him
that the living of Delaford, now just vacant, as I am informed by this
days post, is his, if he think it worth his acceptancebut THAT,
perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now, it may be
nonsense to appear to doubt I only wish it were more  valuable. It
is a rectory, but a small one the late incumbent, I believe, did not
make more than 200 L per annum, and though it is certainly capable of
improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as to afford him a very
comfortable income.  Such as it is, however, my pleasure in presenting
him to it, will be very great.  Pray assure him of it."
 
Elinors astonishment at this commission could hardly have been
greater, had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand.
The preferment, which only two days before she had considered as
hopeless for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marryand
SHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on to bestow it!Her
emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different
causebut whatever minor feelings less pure, less pleasing, might
have a share in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence,
and her gratitude for the particular friendship, which together
prompted Colonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, and warmly
expressed.  She thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke of
Edwards principles and disposition with that praise which she knew
them to deserve and promised to undertake the commission with
pleasure, if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office
to another.  But at the same time, she could not help thinking that no
one could so well perform it as himself.  It was an office in short,
from which, unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an
obligation from HER, she would have been very glad to be spared
herself but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy, declining
it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being given through her
means, that she would not on any account make farther opposition.
Edward, she believed, was still in town, and fortunately she had heard
his address from Miss Steele.  She could undertake therefore to inform
him of it, in the course of the day.  After this had been settled,
Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so
respectable and agreeable a neighbour, and THEN it was that he
mentioned with regret, that the house was small and indifferentan
evil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do, made very
light of, at least as far as regarded its size.
 
"The smallness of the house," said she, "I cannot imagine any
inconvenience to them, for it will be in proportion to their family and
income."
 
By which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE was considering Mr.
Ferrarss marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation for
he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply such
an income, as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle
onand he said so.
 
"This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable
as a bachelor it cannot enable him to marry.  I am sorry to say that
my patronage ends with this and my interest is hardly more extensive.
If, however, by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve
him farther, I must think very differently of him from what I now do,
if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I
could be at present.  What I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all,
since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal,
his only object of happiness.  His marriage must still be a distant
goodat least, I am afraid it cannot take place very soon."
 
Such was the sentence which, when misunderstood, so justly offended the
delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings but after this narration of what
really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they stood at
the window, the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, may
perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited, nor less
properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 40
 
 
"Well, Miss Dashwood," said Mrs. Jennings, sagaciously smiling, as soon
as the gentleman had withdrawn, "I do not ask you what the Colonel has
been saying to you for though, upon my honour, I TRIED to keep out of
hearing, I could not help catching enough to understand his business.
And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life, and I wish you
joy of it with all my heart."
 
"Thank you, maam," said Elinor.  "It is a matter of great joy to me
and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly.  There are
not many men who would act as he has done.  Few people who have so
compassionate a heart!  I never was more astonished in my life."
 
"Lord! my dear, you are very modest.  I ant the least astonished at it
in the world, for I have often thought of late, there was nothing more
likely to happen."
 
"You judged from your knowledge of the Colonels general benevolence
but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very
soon occur."
 
"Opportunity!" repeated Mrs. Jennings"Oh! as to that, when a man has
once made up his mind to such a thing, somehow or other he will soon
find an opportunity.  Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and
again and if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think I
shall soon know where to look for them."
 
"You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose," said Elinor, with a
faint smile.
 
"Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed.  And as to the house being a bad one,
I do not know what the Colonel would be at, for it is as good a one as
ever I saw."
 
"He spoke of its being out of repair."
 
"Well, and whose fault is that? why dont he repair it?who should do
it but himself?"
 
They were interrupted by the servants coming in to announce the
carriage being at the door and Mrs. Jennings immediately preparing to
go, said,
 
"Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had half my talk out.
But, however, we may have it all over in the evening for we shall be
quite alone.  I do not ask you to go with me, for I dare say your mind
is too full of the matter to care for company and besides, you must
long to tell your sister all about it."
 
Marianne had left the room before the conversation began.
 
"Certainly, maam, I shall tell Marianne of it but I shall not mention
it at present to any body else."
 
"Oh! very well," said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed.  "Then you
would not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think of going as far as
Holborn today."
 
"No, maam, not even Lucy if you please.  One days delay will not be
very material and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it ought
not to be mentioned to any body else.  I shall do THAT directly.  It is
of importance that no time should be lost with him, for he will of
course have much to do relative to his ordination."
 
This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly.  Why Mr.
Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry, she could
not immediately comprehend.  A few moments reflection, however,
produced a very happy idea, and she exclaimed
 
"Oh, ho!I understand you.  Mr. Ferrars is to be the man.  Well, so
much the better for him.  Ay, to be sure, he must be ordained in
readiness and I am very glad to find things are so forward between
you.  But, my dear, is not this rather out of character?  Should not
the Colonel write himself?sure, he is the proper person."
 
Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jenningss
speech, neither did she think it worth inquiring into and therefore
only replied to its conclusion.
 
"Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather wished any one to
announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself."
 
"And so YOU are forced to do it.  Well THAT is an odd kind of delicacy!
However, I will not disturb you seeing her preparing to write.  You
know your own concerns best.  So goodby, my dear.  I have not heard of
any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed."
 
And away she went but returning again in a moment,
 
"I have just been thinking of Bettys sister, my dear.  I should be
very glad to get her so good a mistress.  But whether she would do for
a ladys maid, I am sure I cant tell.  She is an excellent housemaid,
and works very well at her needle.  However, you will think of all that
at your leisure."
 
"Certainly, maam," replied Elinor, not hearing much of what she said,
and more anxious to be alone, than to be mistress of the subject.
 
How she should beginhow she should express herself in her note to
Edward, was now all her concern.  The particular circumstances between
them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have
been the easiest thing in the world but she equally feared to say too
much or too little, and sat deliberating over her paper, with the pen
in her hand, till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.
 
He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage, as he
came to leave his farewell card and she, after apologising for not
returning herself, had obliged him to enter, by saying that Miss
Dashwood was above, and wanted to speak with him on very particular
business.
 
Elinor had just been congratulating herself, in the midst of her
perplexity, that however difficult it might be to express herself
properly by letter, it was at least preferable to giving the
information by word of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her
upon this greatest exertion of all.  Her astonishment and confusion
were very great on his so sudden appearance.  She had not seen him
before since his engagement became public, and therefore not since his
knowing her to be acquainted with it which, with the consciousness of
what she had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him, made her
feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes.  He too was much
distressed and they sat down together in a most promising state of
embarrassment.Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on
first coming into the room, he could not recollect but determining to
be on the safe side, he made his apology in form as soon as he could
say any thing, after taking a chair.
 
"Mrs. Jennings told me," said he, "that you wished to speak with me, at
least I understood her soor I certainly should not have intruded on
you in such a manner though at the same time, I should have been
extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister
especially as it will most likely be some timeit is not probable that
I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again.  I go to Oxford
tomorrow."
 
"You would not have gone, however," said Elinor, recovering herself,
and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as
possible, "without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been
able to give them in person.  Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she
said.  I have something of consequence to inform you of, which I was on
the point of communicating by paper.  I am charged with a most
agreeable office breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke.
Colonel Brandon, who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to
say, that understanding you mean to take orders, he has great pleasure
in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant, and only wishes
it were more valuable.  Allow me to congratulate you on having so
respectable and welljudging a friend, and to join in his wish that the
livingit is about two hundred ayearwere much more considerable,
and such as might better enable you toas might be more than a
temporary accommodation to yourselfsuch, in short, as might establish
all your views of happiness."
 
What Edward felt, as he could not say it himself, it cannot be expected
that any one else should say for him.  He LOOKED all the astonishment
which such unexpected, such unthoughtof information could not fail of
exciting but he said only these two words,
 
"Colonel Brandon!"
 
"Yes," continued Elinor, gathering more resolution, as some of the
worst was over, "Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern
for what has lately passedfor the cruel situation in which the
unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed youa concern which I
am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends, must share and
likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character, and
his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion."
 
"Colonel Brandon give ME a living!Can it be possible?"
 
"The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find
friendship any where."
 
"No," replied he, with sudden consciousness, "not to find it in YOU
for I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness, I owe it
all.I feel itI would express it if I couldbut, as you well know,
I am no orator."
 
"You are very much mistaken.  I do assure you that you owe it entirely,
at least almost entirely, to your own merit, and Colonel Brandons
discernment of it.  I have had no hand in it.  I did not even know,
till I understood his design, that the living was vacant nor had it
ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift.
As a friend of mine, of my family, he may, perhapsindeed I know he
HAS, still greater pleasure in bestowing it but, upon my word, you owe
nothing to my solicitation."
 
Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action, but
she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of
Edward, that she acknowledged it with hesitation which probably
contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently
entered it.  For a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had
ceased to speakat last, and as if it were rather an effort, he said,
 
"Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability.  I have
always heard him spoken of as such, and your brother I know esteems him
highly.  He is undoubtedly a sensible man, and in his manners perfectly
the gentleman."
 
"Indeed," replied Elinor, "I believe that you will find him, on farther
acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be, and as you will be
such very near neighbours for I understand the parsonage is almost
close to the mansionhouse, it is particularly important that he
SHOULD be all this."
 
Edward made no answer but when she had turned away her head, gave her
a look so serious, so earnest, so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he
might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the
mansionhouse much greater.
 
"Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Street," said he, soon
afterwards, rising from his chair.
 
Elinor told him the number of the house.
 
"I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks which you will not
allow me to give YOU to assure him that he has made me a veryan
exceedingly happy man."
 
Elinor did not offer to detain him and they parted, with a very
earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing good wishes for his
happiness in every change of situation that might befall him on HIS,
with rather an attempt to return the same good will, than the power of
expressing it.
 
"When I see him again," said Elinor to herself, as the door shut him
out, "I shall see him the husband of Lucy."
 
And with this pleasing anticipation, she sat down to reconsider the
past, recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of
Edward and, of course, to reflect on her own with discontent.
 
When Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned from seeing people
whom she had never seen before, and of whom therefore she must have a
great deal to say, her mind was so much more occupied by the important
secret in her possession, than by anything else, that she reverted to
it again as soon as Elinor appeared.
 
"Well, my dear," she cried, "I sent you up the young man.  Did not I
do right?And I suppose you had no great difficultyYou did not find
him very unwilling to accept your proposal?"
 
"No, maam THAT was not very likely."
 
"Well, and how soon will he be ready?For it seems all to depend upon
that."
 
"Really," said Elinor, "I know so little of these kind of forms, that I
can hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparation
necessary but I suppose two or three months will complete his
ordination."
 
"Two or three months!" cried Mrs. Jennings "Lord! my dear, how calmly
you talk of it and can the Colonel wait two or three months! Lord
bless me!I am sure it would put ME quite out of patience!And though
one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do think
it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him.  Sure
somebody else might be found that would do as well somebody that is in
orders already."
 
"My dear maam," said Elinor, "what can you be thinking of? Why,
Colonel Brandons only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars."
 
"Lord bless you, my dear!Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the
Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr.
Ferrars!"
 
The deception could not continue after this and an explanation
immediately took place, by which both gained considerable amusement for
the moment, without any material loss of happiness to either, for Mrs.
Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another, and still
without forfeiting her expectation of the first.
 
"Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one," said she, after the first
ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over, "and very likely MAY
be out of repair but to hear a man apologising, as I thought, for a
house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the groundfloor,
and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!and to
you too, that had been used to live in Barton cottage! It seems quite
ridiculous.  But, my dear, we must touch up the Colonel to do some
thing to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for them, before Lucy
goes to it."
 
"But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the livings
being enough to allow them to marry."
 
"The Colonel is a ninny, my dear because he has two thousand ayear
himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry on less.  Take my word
for it, that, if I am alive, I shall be paying a visit at Delaford
Parsonage before Michaelmas and I am sure I shant go if Lucy ant
there."
 
Elinor was quite of her opinion, as to the probability of their not
waiting for any thing more.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 41
 
 
Edward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon, proceeded with
his happiness to Lucy and such was the excess of it by the time he
reached Bartletts Buildings, that she was able to assure Mrs.
Jennings, who called on her again the next day with her
congratulations, that she had never seen him in such spirits before in
her life.
 
Her own happiness, and her own spirits, were at least very certain and
she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their
being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas.
So far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness to give Elinor
that credit which Edward WOULD give her, that she spoke of her
friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth, was ready to
own all their obligation to her, and openly declared that no exertion
for their good on Miss Dashwoods part, either present or future, would
ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of doing any thing in
the world for those she really valued.  As for Colonel Brandon, she was
not only ready to worship him as a saint, but was moreover truly
anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns
anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost and scarcely
resolved to avail herself, at Delaford, as far as she possibly could,
of his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his poultry.
 
It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley
Street, and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his
wifes indisposition, beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel
it necessary to pay her a visit.This was an obligation, however,
which not only opposed her own inclination, but which had not the
assistance of any encouragement from her companions.  Marianne, not
contented with absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent to
prevent her sisters going at all and Mrs. Jennings, though her
carriage was always at Elinors service, so very much disliked Mrs.
John Dashwood, that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after
the late discovery, nor her strong desire to affront her by taking
Edwards part, could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company
again.  The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay a
visit, for which no one could really have less inclination, and to run
the risk of a teteatete with a woman, whom neither of the others had
so much reason to dislike.
 
Mrs. Dashwood was denied but before the carriage could turn from the
house, her husband accidentally came out.  He expressed great pleasure
in meeting Elinor, told her that he had been just going to call in
Berkeley Street, and, assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see
her, invited her to come in.
 
They walked up stairs in to the drawingroom.Nobody was there.
 
"Fanny is in her own room, I suppose," said he"I will go to her
presently, for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the
world to seeing YOU. Very far from it, indeed.  NOW especially there
cannot bebut however, you and Marianne were always great
favourites.Why would not Marianne come?"
 
Elinor made what excuse she could for her.
 
"I am not sorry to see you alone," he replied, "for I have a good deal
to say to you.  This living of Colonel Brandonscan it be true?has
he really given it to Edward?I heard it yesterday by chance, and was
coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it."
 
"It is perfectly true.Colonel Brandon has given the living of
Delaford to Edward."
 
"Really!Well, this is very astonishing!no relationship!no
connection between them!and now that livings fetch such a
price!what was the value of this?"
 
"About two hundred a year."
 
"Very welland for the next presentation to a living of that
valuesupposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly, and
likely to vacate it soonhe might have got I dare sayfourteen
hundred pounds.  And how came he not to have settled that matter before
this persons death?NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it, but a
man of Colonel Brandons sense!I wonder he should be so improvident
in a point of such common, such natural, concern!Well, I am convinced
that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human
character.  I suppose, howeveron recollectionthat the case may
probably be THIS.  Edward is only to hold the living till the person to
whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough to
take it.Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it."
 
Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively and by relating that
she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel
Brandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on which
it was given, obliged him to submit to her authority.
 
"It is truly astonishing!"he cried, after hearing what she
said"what could be the Colonels motive?"
 
"A very simple oneto be of use to Mr. Ferrars."
 
"Well, well whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a very lucky
man.You will not mention the matter to Fanny, however, for though I
have broke it to her, and she bears it vastly well,she will not like
to hear it much talked of."
 
Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing, that she
thought Fanny might have borne with composure, an acquisition of wealth
to her brother, by which neither she nor her child could be possibly
impoverished.
 
"Mrs. Ferrars," added he, lowering his voice to the tone becoming so
important a subject, "knows nothing about it at present, and I believe
it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may
be. When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all."
 
"But why should such precaution be used?Though it is not to be
supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in
knowing that her son has money enough to live upon,for THAT must be
quite out of the question yet why, upon her late behaviour, is she
supposed to feel at all?She has done with her son, she cast him off
for ever, and has made all those over whom she had any influence, cast
him off likewise.  Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined
liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his accountshe cannot
be interested in any thing that befalls him. She would not be so weak
as to throw away the comfort of a child, and yet retain the anxiety of
a parent!"
 
"Ah! Elinor," said John, "your reasoning is very good, but it is
founded on ignorance of human nature.  When Edwards unhappy match
takes place, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had
never discarded him and, therefore every circumstance that may
accelerate that dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as
possible.  Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son."
 
"You surprise me I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory
by THIS time."
 
"You wrong her exceedingly.  Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most
affectionate mothers in the world."
 
Elinor was silent.
 
"We think NOW,"said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause, "of ROBERTS
marrying Miss Morton."
 
Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brothers
tone, calmly replied,
 
"The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair."
 
"Choice!how do you mean?"
 
"I only mean that I suppose, from your manner of speaking, it must be
the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert."
 
"Certainly, there can be no difference for Robert will now to all
intents and purposes be considered as the eldest sonand as to any
thing else, they are both very agreeable young men I do not know that
one is superior to the other."
 
Elinor said no more, and John was also for a short time silent.His
reflections ended thus.
 
"Of ONE thing, my dear sister," kindly taking her hand, and speaking in
an awful whisper,"I may assure youand I WILL do it, because I know
it must gratify you.  I have good reason to thinkindeed I have it
from the best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise it
would be very wrong to say any thing about itbut I have it from the
very best authoritynot that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say
it herselfbut her daughter DID, and I have it from herThat in
short, whatever objections there might be against a certaina certain
connectionyou understand meit would have been far preferable to
her, it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does.  I
was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that
lighta very gratifying circumstance you know to us all.  It would
have been beyond comparison, she said, the least evil of the two, and
she would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse. But however, all
that is quite out of the questionnot to be thought of or
mentionedas to any attachment you knowit never could beall that
is gone by.  But I thought I would just tell you of this, because I
knew how much it must please you.  Not that you have any reason to
regret, my dear Elinor.  There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly
wellquite as well, or better, perhaps, all things considered.  Has
Colonel Brandon been with you lately?"
 
Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity, and raise her
selfimportance, to agitate her nerves and fill her mindand she was
therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply
herself, and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her
brother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars.  After a few moments
chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her
sisters being there, quitted the room in quest of her and Elinor was
left to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the gay
unconcern, the happy selfcomplacency of his manner while enjoying so
unfair a division of his mothers love and liberality, to the prejudice
of his banished brother, earned only by his own dissipated course of
life, and that brothers integrity, was confirming her most
unfavourable opinion of his head and heart.
 
They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves, before he began to
speak of Edward for he, too, had heard of the living, and was very
inquisitive on the subject.  Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as
she had given them to John and their effect on Robert, though very
different, was not less striking than it had been on HIM.  He laughed
most immoderately.  The idea of Edwards being a clergyman, and living
in a small parsonagehouse, diverted him beyond measureand when to
that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a
white surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith
and Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.
 
Elinor, while she waited in silence and immovable gravity, the
conclusion of such folly, could not restrain her eyes from being fixed
on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited.  It was a
look, however, very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings,
and gave no intelligence to him.  He was recalled from wit to wisdom,
not by any reproof of hers, but by his own sensibility.
 
"We may treat it as a joke," said he, at last, recovering from the
affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety
of the moment"but, upon my soul, it is a most serious business.  Poor
Edward!  he is ruined for ever.  I am extremely sorry for itfor I
know him to be a very goodhearted creature as wellmeaning a fellow
perhaps, as any in the world.  You must not judge of him, Miss
Dashwood, from YOUR slight acquaintance.Poor Edward!His manners are
certainly not the happiest in nature.But we are not all born, you
know, with the same powers,the same address. Poor fellow!to see
him in a circle of strangers!to be sure it was pitiable enough!but
upon my soul, I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom
and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life, as
when it all burst forth.  I could not believe it. My mother was the
first person who told me of it and I, feeling myself called on to act
with resolution, immediately said to her, My dear madam, I do not know
what you may intend to do on the occasion, but as for myself, I must
say, that if Edward does marry this young woman, I never will see him
again. That was what I said immediately. I was most uncommonly
shocked, indeed!Poor Edward!he has done for himself
completelyshut himself out for ever from all decent society!but, as
I directly said to my mother, I am not in the least surprised at it
from his style of education, it was always to be expected.  My poor
mother was half frantic."
 
"Have you ever seen the lady?"
 
"Yes once, while she was staying in this house, I happened to drop in
for ten minutes and I saw quite enough of her.  The merest awkward
country girl, without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty.
I remember her perfectly.  Just the kind of girl I should suppose
likely to captivate poor Edward.  I offered immediately, as soon as my
mother related the affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuade
him from the match but it was too late THEN, I found, to do any thing,
for unluckily, I was not in the way at first, and knew nothing of it
till after the breach had taken place, when it was not for me, you
know, to interfere.  But had I been informed of it a few hours
earlierI think it is most probablethat something might have been
hit on.  I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very
strong light.  My dear fellow, I should have said, consider what you
are doing.  You are making a most disgraceful connection, and such a
one as your family are unanimous in disapproving. I cannot help
thinking, in short, that means might have been found.  But now it is
all too late.  He must be starved, you knowthat is certain
absolutely starved."
 
He had just settled this point with great composure, when the entrance
of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject.  But though SHE never
spoke of it out of her own family, Elinor could see its influence on
her mind, in the something like confusion of countenance with which she
entered, and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself.  She
even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her
sister were so soon to leave town, as she had hoped to see more of
theman exertion in which her husband, who attended her into the
room, and hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to distinguish every
thing that was most affectionate and graceful.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 42
 
 
One other short call in Harley Street, in which Elinor received her
brothers congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton
without any expense, and on Colonel Brandons being to follow them to
Cleveland in a day or two, completed the intercourse of the brother and
sisters in townand a faint invitation from Fanny, to come to Norland
whenever it should happen to be in their way, which of all things was
the most unlikely to occur, with a more warm, though less public,
assurance, from John to Elinor, of the promptitude with which he should
come to see her at Delaford, was all that foretold any meeting in the
country.
 
It amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send
her to Delaforda place, in which, of all others, she would now least
chuse to visit, or wish to reside for not only was it considered as
her future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings, but even Lucy, when
they parted, gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there.
 
Very early in April, and tolerably early in the day, the two parties
from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respective
homes, to meet, by appointment, on the road.  For the convenience of
Charlotte and her child, they were to be more than two days on their
journey, and Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with Colonel
Brandon, was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival.
 
Marianne, few as had been her hours of comfort in London, and eager as
she had long been to quit it, could not, when it came to the point, bid
adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed those
hopes, and that confidence, in Willoughby, which were now extinguished
for ever, without great pain.  Nor could she leave the place in which
Willoughby remained, busy in new engagements, and new schemes, in which
SHE could have no share, without shedding many tears.
 
Elinors satisfaction, at the moment of removal, was more positive.
She had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on, she left
no creature behind, from whom it would give her a moments regret to be
divided for ever, she was pleased to be free herself from the
persecution of Lucys friendship, she was grateful for bringing her
sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage, and she looked
forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might
do towards restoring Mariannes peace of mind, and confirming her own.
 
Their journey was safely performed.  The second day brought them into
the cherished, or the prohibited, county of Somerset, for as such was
it dwelt on by turns in Mariannes imagination and in the forenoon of
the third they drove up to Cleveland.
 
Cleveland was a spacious, modernbuilt house, situated on a sloping
lawn.  It had no park, but the pleasuregrounds were tolerably
extensive and like every other place of the same degree of importance,
it had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk, a road of smooth
gravel winding round a plantation, led to the front, the lawn was
dotted over with timber, the house itself was under the guardianship of
the fir, the mountainash, and the acacia, and a thick screen of them
altogether, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars, shut out the
offices.
 
Marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the
consciousness of being only eighty miles from Barton, and not thirty
from Combe Magna and before she had been five minutes within its
walls, while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her child
to the housekeeper, she quitted it again, stealing away through the
winding shrubberies, now just beginning to be in beauty, to gain a
distant eminence where, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering
over a wide tract of country to the southeast, could fondly rest on
the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon, and fancy that from their
summits Combe Magna might be seen.
 
In such moments of precious, invaluable misery, she rejoiced in tears
of agony to be at Cleveland and as she returned by a different circuit
to the house, feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty, of
wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude, she
resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained
with the Palmers, in the indulgence of such solitary rambles.
 
She returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house,
on an excursion through its more immediate premises and the rest of
the morning was easily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchen
garden, examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to the
gardeners lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through the
greenhouse, where the loss of her favourite plants, unwarily exposed,
and nipped by the lingering frost, raised the laughter of
Charlotte,and in visiting her poultryyard, where, in the
disappointed hopes of her dairymaid, by hens forsaking their nests, or
being stolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising young
brood, she found fresh sources of merriment.
 
The morning was fine and dry, and Marianne, in her plan of employment
abroad, had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay
at Cleveland.  With great surprise therefore, did she find herself
prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner.  She had
depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple, and perhaps all over
the grounds, and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred
her from it but a heavy and settled rain even SHE could not fancy dry
or pleasant weather for walking.
 
Their party was small, and the hours passed quietly away.  Mrs. Palmer
had her child, and Mrs. Jennings her carpetwork they talked of the
friends they had left behind, arranged Lady Middletons engagements,
and wondered whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther
than Reading that night.  Elinor, however little concerned in it,
joined in their discourse and Marianne, who had the knack of finding
her way in every house to the library, however it might be avoided by
the family in general, soon procured herself a book.
 
Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmers side that constant and friendly
good humour could do, to make them feel themselves welcome.  The
openness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want of
recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms
of politeness her kindness, recommended by so pretty a face, was
engaging her folly, though evident was not disgusting, because it was
not conceited and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh.
 
The two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner, affording
a pleasant enlargement of the party, and a very welcome variety to
their conversation, which a long morning of the same continued rain had
reduced very low.
 
Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that little had seen so
much variety in his address to her sister and herself, that she knew
not what to expect to find him in his own family.  She found him,
however, perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors,
and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother she found him
very capable of being a pleasant companion, and only prevented from
being so always, by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much
superior to people in general, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs.
Jennings and Charlotte.  For the rest of his character and habits, they
were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive, with no traits at all
unusual in his sex and time of life.  He was nice in his eating,
uncertain in his hours fond of his child, though affecting to slight
it and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought to have been
devoted to business.  She liked him, however, upon the whole, much
better than she had expected, and in her heart was not sorry that she
could like him no morenot sorry to be driven by the observation of
his Epicurism, his selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with
complacency on the remembrance of Edwards generous temper, simple
taste, and diffident feelings.
 
Of Edward, or at least of some of his concerns, she now received
intelligence from Colonel Brandon, who had been into Dorsetshire
lately and who, treating her at once as the disinterested friend of
Mr. Ferrars, and the kind of confidant of himself, talked to her a
great deal of the parsonage at Delaford, described its deficiencies,
and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them.His
behaviour to her in this, as well as in every other particular, his
open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days, his
readiness to converse with her, and his deference for her opinion,
might very well justify Mrs. Jenningss persuasion of his attachment,
and would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still, as from the
first, believed Marianne his real favourite, to make her suspect it
herself.  But as it was, such a notion had scarcely ever entered her
head, except by Mrs. Jenningss suggestion and she could not help
believing herself the nicest observer of the twoshe watched his
eyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his behaviourand while his
looks of anxious solicitude on Mariannes feeling, in her head and
throat, the beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words,
entirely escaped the latter ladys observationSHE could discover in
them the quick feelings, and needless alarm of a lover.
 
Two delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her
being there, not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery, but all
over the grounds, and especially in the most distant parts of them,
where there was something more of wildness than in the rest, where the
trees were the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest,
hadassisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet
shoes and stockingsgiven Marianne a cold so violent as, though for a
day or two trifled with or denied, would force itself by increasing
ailments on the concern of every body, and the notice of herself.
Prescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual, were all
declined.  Though heavy and feverish, with a pain in her limbs, and a
cough, and a sore throat, a good nights rest was to cure her entirely
and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her, when she went
to bed, to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 43
 
 
Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time to every inquiry
replied that she was better, and tried to prove herself so, by engaging
in her accustomary employments.  But a day spent in sitting shivering
over the fire with a book in her hand, which she was unable to read, or
in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak much in favour of
her amendment and when, at last, she went early to bed, more and more
indisposed, Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sisters
composure, who, though attending and nursing her the whole day, against
Mariannes inclination, and forcing proper medicines on her at night,
trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty and efficacy of sleep, and
felt no real alarm.
 
A very restless and feverish night, however, disappointed the
expectation of both and when Marianne, after persisting in rising,
confessed herself unable to sit up, and returned voluntarily to her
bed, Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jenningss advice, of sending
for the Palmers apothecary.
 
He came, examined his patient, and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to
expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health, yet, by
pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency, and allowing the
word "infection" to pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer,
on her babys account.  Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined from the
first to think Mariannes complaint more serious than Elinor, now
looked very grave on Mr. Harriss report, and confirming Charlottes
fears and caution, urged the necessity of her immediate removal with
her infant and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as
idle, found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be
withstood.  Her departure, therefore, was fixed on and within an hour
after Mr. Harriss arrival, she set off, with her little boy and his
nurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmers, who lived a
few miles on the other side of Bath whither her husband promised, at
her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two and whither she was
almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her.  Mrs. Jennings,
however, with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her,
declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as
Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring, by her own attentive care,
to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from and
Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate,
desirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her better
experience in nursing, of material use.
 
Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature of her malady, and
feeling herself universally ill, could no longer hope that tomorrow
would find her recovered and the idea of what tomorrow would have
produced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe for
on that day they were to have begun their journey home and, attended
the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have taken their
mother by surprise on the following forenoon.  The little she said was
all in lamentation of this inevitable delay though Elinor tried to
raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN really believed
herself, that it would be a very short one.
 
The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the
patient she certainly was not better, and, except that there was no
amendment, did not appear worse.  Their party was now farther reduced
for Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity
and goodnature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away
by his wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his
promise of following her and while he was preparing to go, Colonel
Brandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going
likewise.Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most
acceptably for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much
uneasiness on her sisters account, would be to deprive them both, she
thought, of every comfort and therefore telling him at once that his
stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself, that she should want him to
play at piquet of an evening, while Miss Dashwood was above with her
sister, c. she urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was
gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not
long even affect to demur especially as Mrs. Jenningss entreaty was
warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to feel a relief to himself,
in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss
Dashwood in any emergence.
 
Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all these arrangements.
She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of
Cleveland away, in about seven days from the time of their arrival.  It
gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer and as it
gave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned her name.
 
Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmers departure, and her
situation continued, with little variation, the same.  Mr. Harris, who
attended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and
Miss Dashwood was equally sanguine but the expectation of the others
was by no means so cheerful.  Mrs. Jennings had determined very early
in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and Colonel
Brandon, who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jenningss
forebodings, was not in a state of mind to resist their influence.  He
tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different judgment of
the apothecary seemed to render absurd but the many hours of each day
in which he was left entirely alone, were but too favourable for the
admission of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from his
mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.
 
On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy anticipations of
both were almost done away for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared
his patient materially better.  Her pulse was much stronger, and every
symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit.  Elinor, confirmed
in every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness rejoicing that in her
letters to her mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than her
friends, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them
at Cleveland and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able
to travel.
 
But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began. Towards the
evening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, and
uncomfortable than before.  Her sister, however, still sanguine, was
willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of
having sat up to have her bed made and carefully administering the
cordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction, sink at last into a
slumber, from which she expected the most beneficial effects.  Her
sleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a
considerable time and anxious to observe the result of it herself, she
resolved to sit with her during the whole of it.  Mrs. Jennings,
knowing nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to
bed her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating
herself in the housekeepers room, and Elinor remained alone with
Marianne.
 
The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed and her
sister, who watched, with unremitting attention her continual change of
posture, and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint
which passed her lips, was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful
a slumber, when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in
the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness, cried out,
 
"Is mama coming?"
 
"Not yet," cried the other, concealing her terror, and assisting
Marianne to lie down again, "but she will be here, I hope, before it is
long.  It is a great way, you know, from hence to Barton."
 
"But she must not go round by London," cried Marianne, in the same
hurried manner.  "I shall never see her, if she goes by London."
 
Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself, and, while
attempting to soothe her, eagerly felt her pulse.  It was lower and
quicker than ever!  and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her
alarm increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending instantly
for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother.
To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the
latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its
performance and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by
her sister, she hastened down to the drawingroom, where she knew he
was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present.
 
It was no time for hesitation.  Her fears and her difficulties were
immediately before him.  Her fears, he had no courage, no confidence to
attempt the removal ofhe listened to them in silent despondencebut
her difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness that
seemed to speak the occasion, and the service prearranged in his mind,
he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood.
Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome. She thanked him
with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went to hurry off his
servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and an order for posthorses
directly, she wrote a few lines to her mother.
 
The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandonor such
a companion for her mother,how gratefully was it felt!a companion
whose judgment would guide, whose attendance must relieve, and whose
friendship might soothe her!as far as the shock of such a summons
COULD be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his assistance,
would lessen it.
 
HE, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all the firmness of a
collected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmost
despatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she might
look for his return.  Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind.  The
horses arrived, even before they were expected, and Colonel Brandon
only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity, and a few words spoken
too low to reach her ear, hurried into the carriage.  It was then about
twelve oclock, and she returned to her sisters apartment to wait for
the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the rest of the
night.  It was a night of almost equal suffering to both.  Hour after
hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Mariannes side, and
in the most cruel anxiety on Elinors, before Mr. Harris appeared.  Her
apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all her former
security and the servant who sat up with her, for she would not allow
Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her more, by hints of what
her mistress had always thought.
 
Mariannes ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her
mother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the
heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with
so many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief,
fancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had
been delayed too long, and pictured to herself her suffering mother
arriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.
 
She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if HE could
not come, for some other advice, when the formerbut not till after
five oclockarrived.  His opinion, however, made some little amends
for his delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and
unpleasant alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger to
be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment
must procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was
communicated to Elinor.  He promised to call again in the course of
three or four hours, and left both the patient and her anxious
attendant more composed than he had found them.
 
With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called to
their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed.
Her former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her no
doubt of the event and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor, her
conviction of her sisters danger would not allow her to offer the
comfort of hope.  Her heart was really grieved.  The rapid decay, the
early death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have struck
a less interested person with concern.  On Mrs. Jenningss compassion
she had other claims.  She had been for three months her companion, was
still under her care, and she was known to have been greatly injured,
and long unhappy.  The distress of her sister too, particularly a
favourite, was before herand as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings
considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what Charlotte was to
herself, her sympathy in HER sufferings was very sincere.
 
Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visitbut he came to be
disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce.  His
medicines had failedthe fever was unabated and Marianne only more
quietnot more herselfremained in a heavy stupor.  Elinor, catching
all, and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call in
further advice.  But he judged it unnecessary he had still something
more to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he was as
confident as the last, and his visit concluded with encouraging
assurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss
Dashwood.  She was calm, except when she thought of her mother but she
was almost hopeless and in this state she continued till noon,
scarcely stirring from her sisters bed, her thoughts wandering from
one image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her spirits
oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings, who
scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the
many weeks of previous indisposition which Mariannes disappointment
had brought on.  Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it
gave fresh misery to her reflections.
 
About noon, however, she beganbut with a cautiona dread of
disappointment which for some time kept her silent, even to her
friendto fancy, to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her
sisters pulseshe waited, watched, and examined it again and
againand at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under
exterior calmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured to
communicate her hopes.  Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination,
to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her young friend from
indulging a thought of its continuanceand Elinor, conning over every
injunction of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope.  But it was
too late.  Hope had already entered and feeling all its anxious
flutter, she bent over her sister to watchshe hardly knew for what.
Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her.
Others even arose to confirm it.  Her breath, her skin, her lips, all
flattered Elinor with signs of amendment and Marianne fixed her eyes
on her with a rational, though languid, gaze.  Anxiety and hope now
oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity
till the arrival of Mr. Harris at four oclockwhen his assurances,
his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his
expectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.
 
Marianne was in every respect materially better, and he declared her
entirely out of danger.  Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied with the
partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their
late alarm, allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,
with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the
probability of an entire recovery.
 
Elinor could not be cheerful.  Her joy was of a different kind, and led
to any thing rather than to gaiety.  Marianne restored to life, health,
friends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with
sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent
gratitudebut it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,
no smiles.  All within Elinors breast was satisfaction, silent and
strong.
 
She continued by the side of her sister, with little intermission the
whole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of her
enfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost every
look and every breath.  The possibility of a relapse would of course,
in some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety wasbut when she
saw, on her frequent and minute examination, that every symptom of
recovery continued, and saw Marianne at six oclock sink into a quiet,
steady, and to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every
doubt.
 
The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expected
back.  At ten oclock, she trusted, or at least not much later her
mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must
now be travelling towards them.  The Colonel, too!perhaps scarcely
less an object of pity!Oh!how slow was the progress of time which
yet kept them in ignorance!
 
At seven oclock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joined
Mrs. Jennings in the drawingroom to tea.  Of breakfast she had been
kept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating
muchand the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of
content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome.  Mrs. Jennings
would have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest before
her mothers arrival, and allow HER to take her place by Marianne but
Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that moment
about her, and she was not to be kept away from her sister an
unnecessary instant.  Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs
into the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,
left her there again to her charge and her thoughts, and retired to her
own room to write letters and sleep.
 
The night was cold and stormy.  The wind roared round the house, and
the rain beat against the windows but Elinor, all happiness within,
regarded it not.  Marianne slept through every blast and the
travellersthey had a rich reward in store, for every present
inconvenience.
 
The clock struck eight.  Had it been ten, Elinor would have been
convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the
house and so strong was the persuasion that she DID, in spite of the
ALMOST impossibility of their being already come, that she moved into
the adjoining dressingcloset and opened a window shutter, to be
satisfied of the truth.  She instantly saw that her ears had not
deceived her.  The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in
view.  By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be
drawn by four horses and this, while it told the excess of her poor
mothers alarm, gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity.
 
Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm, as at
that moment.  The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the
carriage stopt at the doorof her doubther dreadperhaps her
despair!and of what SHE had to tell!with such knowledge it was
impossible to be calm.  All that remained to be done was to be speedy
and, therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jenningss maid
with her sister, she hurried down stairs.
 
The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along an inner lobby,
assured her that they were already in the house.  She rushed to the
drawingroom,she entered it,and saw only Willoughby.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 44
 
 
Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him, obeyed
the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room,
and her hand was already on the lock, when its action was suspended by
his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of command than
supplication,
 
"Miss Dashwood, for half an hourfor ten minutesI entreat you to
stay."
 
"No, sir," she replied with firmness, "I shall NOT stay.  Your business
cannot be with ME.  The servants, I suppose, forgot to tell you that
Mr. Palmer was not in the house."
 
"Had they told me," he cried with vehemence, "that Mr. Palmer and all
his relations were at the devil, it would not have turned me from the
door.  My business is with you, and only you."
 
"With me!"in the utmost amazement"well, sir,be quickand if you
canless violent."
 
"Sit down, and I will be both."
 
She hesitated she knew not what to do.  The possibility of Colonel
Brandons arriving and finding her there, came across her.  But she had
promised to hear him, and her curiosity no less than her honor was
engaged.  After a moments recollection, therefore, concluding that
prudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would best
promote it, she walked silently towards the table, and sat down.  He
took the opposite chair, and for half a minute not a word was said by
either.
 
"Pray be quick, sir,"said Elinor, impatiently"I have no time to
spare."
 
He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation, and seemed not to
hear her.
 
"Your sister," said he, with abruptness, a moment afterwards"is out
of danger.  I heard it from the servant.  God be praised!But is it
true? is it really true?"
 
Elinor would not speak.  He repeated the inquiry with yet greater
eagerness.
 
"For Gods sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not?"
 
"We hope she is."
 
He rose up, and walked across the room.
 
"Had I known as much half an hour agoBut since I AM here,"speaking
with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat"what does it
signify?For once, Miss Dashwoodit will be the last time,
perhapslet us be cheerful together.I am in a fine mood for
gaiety. Tell me honestly"a deeper glow overspreading his
cheeks"do you think me most a knave or a fool?"
 
Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever.  She began to
think that he must be in liquorthe strangeness of such a visit, and
of such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible and with this
impression she immediately rose, saying,
 
"Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return to CombeI am not
at leisure to remain with you longer. Whatever your business may be
with me, will it be better recollected and explained tomorrow."
 
"I understand you," he replied, with an expressive smile, and a voice
perfectly calm "yes, I am very drunk. A pint of porter with my cold
beef at Marlborough was enough to overset me."
 
"At Marlborough!"cried Elinor, more and more at a loss to understand
what he would be at.
 
"Yes,I left London this morning at eight oclock, and the only ten
minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a
nuncheon at Marlborough."
 
The steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence of his eye as he
spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever other unpardonable folly might
bring him to Cleveland, he was not brought there by intoxication, she
said, after a moments recollection,
 
"Mr. Willoughby, you OUGHT to feel, and I certainly DOthat after what
has passedyour coming here in this manner, and forcing yourself upon
my notice, requires a very particular excuse.What is it, that you
mean by it?"
 
"I mean,"said he, with serious energy"if I can, to make you hate me
one degree less than you do NOW.  I mean to offer some kind of
explanation, some kind of apology, for the past to open my whole heart
to you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always a
blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something like
forgiveness from Mafrom your sister."
 
"Is this the real reason of your coming?"
 
"Upon my soul it is,"was his answer, with a warmth which brought all
the former Willoughby to her remembrance, and in spite of herself made
her think him sincere.
 
"If that is all, you may be satisfied already,for Marianne DOESshe
has LONG forgiven you."
 
"Has she?"he cried, in the same eager tone. "Then she has forgiven
me before she ought to have done it.  But she shall forgive me again,
and on more reasonable grounds.NOW will you listen to me?"
 
Elinor bowed her assent.
 
"I do not know," said he, after a pause of expectation on her side, and
thoughtfulness on his own,"how YOU may have accounted for my
behaviour to your sister, or what diabolical motive you may have
imputed to me. Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,it is
worth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing.  When I first
became intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other view
in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged
to remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before.
Your sisters lovely person and interesting manners could not but
please me and her behaviour to me almost from the first, was of a
kindIt is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what SHE
was, that my heart should have been so insensible!  But at first I must
confess, my vanity only was elevated by it.  Careless of her happiness,
thinking only of my own amusement, giving way to feelings which I had
always been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every
means in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any design
of returning her affection."
 
Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him with the most
angry contempt, stopped him, by saying,
 
"It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby, for you to relate, or for me
to listen any longer.  Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by
any thing. Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the
subject."
 
"I insist on you hearing the whole of it," he replied, "My fortune was
never large, and I had always been expensive, always in the habit of
associating with people of better income than myself.  Every year since
my coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my debts and
though the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free yet
that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it had been for
some time my intention to reestablish my circumstances by marrying a
woman of fortune.  To attach myself to your sister, therefore, was not
a thing to be thought ofand with a meanness, selfishness,
crueltywhich no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours, Miss
Dashwood, can ever reprobate too muchI was acting in this manner,
trying to engage her regard, without a thought of returning it.But
one thing may be said for me even in that horrid state of selfish
vanity, I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated, because I
did not THEN know what it was to love.  But have I ever known it?Well
may it be doubted for, had I really loved, could I have sacrificed my
feelings to vanity, to avarice?or, what is more, could I have
sacrificed hers? But I have done it.  To avoid a comparative poverty,
which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its
horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence, lost every thing that
could make it a blessing."
 
"You did then," said Elinor, a little softened, "believe yourself at
one time attached to her?"
 
"To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood such
tenderness!Is there a man on earth who could have done it?Yes, I
found myself, by insensible degrees, sincerely fond of her and the
happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my
intentions were strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless.  Even
THEN, however, when fully determined on paying my addresses to her, I
allowed myself most improperly to put off, from day to day, the moment
of doing it, from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my
circumstances were so greatly embarrassed.  I will not reason herenor
will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse than
absurdity, of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already
bound.  The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool, providing with
great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself
contemptible and wretched for ever.  At last, however, my resolution
was taken, and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone,
to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her, and openly
assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to
display.  But in the interimin the interim of the very few hours that
were to pass, before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her
in privatea circumstance occurredan unlucky circumstance, to ruin
all my resolution, and with it all my comfort.  A discovery took
place,"here he hesitated and looked down."Mrs. Smith had somehow or
other been informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose interest
it was to deprive me of her favour, of an affair, a connectionbut I
need not explain myself farther," he added, looking at her with an
heightened colour and an enquiring eye"your particular intimacyyou
have probably heard the whole story long ago."
 
"I have," returned Elinor, colouring likewise, and hardening her heart
anew against any compassion for him, "I have heard it all.  And how you
will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I
confess is beyond my comprehension."
 
"Remember," cried Willoughby, "from whom you received the account.
Could it be an impartial one?  I acknowledge that her situation and her
character ought to have been respected by me.  I do not mean to justify
myself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have
nothing to urgethat because she was injured she was irreproachable,
and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint.  If the violence of
her passions, the weakness of her understandingI do not mean,
however, to defend myself.  Her affection for me deserved better
treatment, and I often, with great selfreproach, recall the tenderness
which, for a very short time, had the power of creating any return.  I
wishI heartily wish it had never been.  But I have injured more than
herself and I have injured one, whose affection for memay I say
it? was scarcely less warm than hers and whose mindOh! how
infinitely superior!"
 
"Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate girlI must say
it, unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well
beyour indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her.  Do
not think yourself excused by any weakness, any natural defect of
understanding on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.
You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself in
Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay, always happy, she was
reduced to the extremest indigence."
 
"But, upon my soul, I did NOT know it," he warmly replied "I did not
recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction and common sense
might have told her how to find it out."
 
"Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?"
 
"She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion may be
guessed.  The purity of her life, the formality of her notions, her
ignorance of the worldevery thing was against me.  The matter itself
I could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it.  She was
previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in
general, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention,
the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in my
present visit.  In short, it ended in a total breach.  By one measure I
might have saved myself.  In the height of her morality, good woman!
she offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza.  That could
not beand I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house.
The night following this affairI was to go the next morningwas
spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be.  The
struggle was greatbut it ended too soon.  My affection for Marianne,
my thorough conviction of her attachment to meit was all insufficient
to outweigh that dread of poverty, or get the better of those false
ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined to
feel, and expensive society had increased.  I had reason to believe
myself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her, and I
persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained
for me to do.  A heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave
DevonshireI was engaged to dine with you on that very day some
apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement.  But
whether I should write this apology, or deliver it in person, was a
point of long debate.  To see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and
I even doubted whether I could see her again, and keep to my
resolution.  In that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity,
as the event declared for I went, I saw her, and saw her miserable,
and left her miserableand left her hoping never to see her again."
 
"Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?" said Elinor, reproachfully "a note
would have answered every purpose. Why was it necessary to call?"
 
"It was necessary to my own pride.  I could not bear to leave the
country in a manner that might lead you, or the rest of the
neighbourhood, to suspect any part of what had really passed between
Mrs. Smith and myselfand I resolved therefore on calling at the
cottage, in my way to Honiton.  The sight of your dear sister, however,
was really dreadful and, to heighten the matter, I found her alone.
You were all gone I do not know where.  I had left her only the evening
before, so fully, so firmly resolved within my self on doing right!  A
few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever and I remember how
happy, how gay were my spirits, as I walked from the cottage to
Allenham, satisfied with myself, delighted with every body!  But in
this, our last interview of friendship, I approached her with a sense
of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling.  Her
sorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told her that I was
obliged to leave Devonshire so immediatelyI never shall forget
itunited too with such reliance, such confidence in me!Oh,
God!what a hardhearted rascal I was!"
 
They were both silent for a few moments.  Elinor first spoke.
 
"Did you tell her that you should soon return?"
 
"I do not know what I told her," he replied, impatiently "less than
was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much more
than was justified by the future.  I cannot think of it.It wont
do.Then came your dear mother to torture me farther, with all her
kindness and confidence.  Thank Heaven! it DID torture me.  I was
miserable.  Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it
gives me to look back on my own misery.  I owe such a grudge to myself
for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart, that all my past
sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now.  Well, I
went, left all that I loved, and went to those to whom, at best, I was
only indifferent.  My journey to towntravelling with my own horses,
and therefore so tediouslyno creature to speak tomy own reflections
so cheerfulwhen I looked forward every thing so inviting!when I
looked back at Barton, the picture so soothing!oh, it was a blessed
journey!"
 
He stopped.
 
"Well, sir," said Elinor, who, though pitying him, grew impatient for
his departure, "and this is all?"
 
"Ah!no,have you forgot what passed in town? That infamous
letterDid she shew it you?"
 
"Yes, I saw every note that passed."
 
"When the first of hers reached me as it immediately did, for I was in
town the whole time, what I felt isin the common phrase, not to be
expressed in a more simple oneperhaps too simple to raise any
emotionmy feelings were very, very painful.Every line, every word
wasin the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer, were she here,
would forbida dagger to my heart.  To know that Marianne was in town
wasin the same languagea thunderbolt.Thunderbolts and
daggers!what a reproof would she have given me!her taste, her
opinionsI believe they are better known to me than my own,and I am
sure they are dearer."
 
Elinors heart, which had undergone many changes in the course of this
extraordinary conversation, was now softened againyet she felt it
her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last.
 
"This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.Remember that you are married.
Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear."
 
"Mariannes note, by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in
former days, that in spite of the many, many weeks we had been
separated, she was as constant in her own feelings, and as full of
faith in the constancy of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse.  I say
awakened, because time and London, business and dissipation, had in
some measure quieted it, and I had been growing a fine hardened
villain, fancying myself indifferent to her, and chusing to fancy that
she too must have become indifferent to me talking to myself of our
past attachment as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my
shoulders in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,
overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then, I shall be
heartily glad to hear she is well married. But this note made me
know myself better.  I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than
any other woman in the world, and that I was using her infamously.  But
every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me.  To retreat
was impossible.  All that I had to do, was to avoid you both.  I sent
no answer to Marianne, intending by that to preserve myself from her
farther notice and for some time I was even determined not to call in
Berkeley Streetbut at last, judging it wiser to affect the air of a
cool, common acquaintance than anything else, I watched you all safely
out of the house one morning, and left my name."
 
"Watched us out of the house!"
 
"Even so.  You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you, how
often I was on the point of falling in with you.  I have entered many a
shop to avoid your sight, as the carriage drove by.  Lodging as I did
in Bond Street, there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a
glimpse of one or other of you and nothing but the most constant
watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keep
out of your sight, could have separated us so long.  I avoided the
Middletons as much as possible, as well as everybody else who was
likely to prove an acquaintance in common.  Not aware of their being in
town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of his
coming, and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jenningss.  He asked me
to a party, a dance at his house in the evening.Had he NOT told me as
an inducement that you and your sister were to be there, I should have
felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him.  The next
morning brought another short note from Mariannestill affectionate,
open, artless, confidingeverything that could make MY conduct most
hateful.  I could not answer it.  I triedbut could not frame a
sentence.  But I thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day.
If you CAN pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it was THEN.
With my head and heart full of your sister, I was forced to play the
happy lover to another woman!Those three or four weeks were worse
than all.  Well, at last, as I need not tell you, you were forced on
me and what a sweet figure I cut!what an evening of agony it was!
Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me Willoughby in
such a tone!Oh, God!holding out her hand to me, asking me for an
explanation, with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking
solicitude on my face!and Sophia, jealous as the devil on the other
hand, looking all that wasWell, it does not signify it is over
now. Such an evening!I ran away from you all as soon as I could
but not before I had seen Mariannes sweet face as white as
death.THAT was the last, last look I ever had of herthe last
manner in which she appeared to me.  It was a horrid sight!yet when I
thought of her today as really dying, it was a kind of comfort to me
to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those, who saw
her last in this world.  She was before me, constantly before me, as I
travelled, in the same look and hue."
 
A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded.  Willoughby first
rousing himself, broke it thus
 
"Well, let me make haste and be gone.  Your sister is certainly better,
certainly out of danger?"
 
"We are assured of it."
 
"Your poor mother, too!doting on Marianne."
 
"But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter have you any thing to
say about that?"
 
"Yes, yes, THAT in particular.  Your sister wrote to me again, you
know, the very next morning.  You saw what she said.  I was
breakfasting at the Ellisons,and her letter, with some others, was
brought to me there from my lodgings.  It happened to catch Sophias
eye before it caught mineand its size, the elegance of the paper, the
handwriting altogether, immediately gave her a suspicion.  Some vague
report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in
Devonshire, and what had passed within her observation the preceding
evening had marked who the young lady was, and made her more jealous
than ever.  Affecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which is
delightful in a woman one loves, she opened the letter directly,
and read its contents.  She was well paid for her impudence.
She read what made her wretched.  Her wretchedness I could have
borne, but her passionher maliceAt all events it must be appeased.
And, in shortwhat do you think of my wifes style of
letterwriting?delicatetendertruly femininewas it not?"
 
"Your wife!The letter was in your own handwriting."
 
"Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as
I was ashamed to put my name to.  The original was all her ownher own
happy thoughts and gentle diction.  But what could I do!we were
engaged, every thing in preparation, the day almost fixedBut I am
talking like a fool.  Preparation!day!In honest words, her money
was necessary to me, and in a situation like mine, any thing was to be
done to prevent a rupture.  And after all, what did it signify to my
character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what language
my answer was couched?It must have been only to one end.  My business
was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether I did it with a bow or a
bluster was of little importance. I am ruined for ever in their
opinion said I to myselfI am shut out for ever from their
society, they already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter will
only make them think me a blackguard one. Such were my reasonings, as,
in a sort of desperate carelessness, I copied my wifes words, and
parted with the last relics of Marianne.  Her three notesunluckily
they were all in my pocketbook, or I should have denied their
existence, and hoarded them for everI was forced to put them up, and
could not even kiss them.  And the lock of hairthat too I had always
carried about me in the same pocketbook, which was now searched by
Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,the dear lockall, every
memento was torn from me."
 
"You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable," said Elinor, while
her voice, in spite of herself, betrayed her compassionate emotion
"you ought not to speak in this way, either of Mrs. Willoughby or my
sister.  You had made your own choice.  It was not forced on you.  Your
wife has a claim to your politeness, to your respect, at least.  She
must be attached to you, or she would not have married you.  To treat
her with unkindness, to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to
Mariannenor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience."
 
"Do not talk to me of my wife," said he with a heavy sigh. "She does
not deserve your compassion.She knew I had no regard for her when we
married.Well, married we were, and came down to Combe Magna to be
happy, and afterwards returned to town to be gay.And now do you pity
me, Miss Dashwood?or have I said all this to no purpose? Am Ibe
it only one degreeam I less guilty in your opinion than I was
before?My intentions were not always wrong.  Have I explained away
any part of my guilt?"
 
"Yes, you have certainly removed somethinga little. You have proved
yourself, on the whole, less faulty than I had believed you.  You have
proved your heart less wicked, much less wicked.  But I hardly
knowthe misery that you have inflictedI hardly know what could have
made it worse."
 
"Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered, what I have been
telling you?Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well
as in yours.  You tell me that she has forgiven me already.  Let me be
able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and of my present
feelings, will draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural, more
gentle, less dignified, forgiveness.  Tell her of my misery and my
penitencetell her that my heart was never inconstant to her, and if
you will, that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever."
 
"I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be
called, your justification.  But you have not explained to me the
particular reason of your coming now, nor how you heard of her illness."
 
"Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir John Middleton, and
when he saw who I wasfor the first time these two monthshe spoke to
me.That he had cut me ever since my marriage, I had seen without
surprise or resentment.  Now, however, his goodnatured, honest, stupid
soul, full of indignation against me, and concern for your sister,
could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought
tothough probably he did not think it WOULDvex me horridly.  As
bluntly as he could speak it, therefore, he told me that Marianne
Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Clevelanda letter that
morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most
imminentthe Palmers are all gone off in a fright, c.I was too much
shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the
undiscerning Sir John.  His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer
and so much of his illwill was done away, that when we parted, he
almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise
about a pointer puppy.  What I felt on hearing that your sister was
dyingand dying too, believing me the greatest villain upon earth,
scorning, hating me in her latest momentsfor how could I tell what
horrid projects might not have been imputed?  ONE person I was sure
would represent me as capable of any thing What I felt was
dreadful!My resolution was soon made, and at eight oclock this
morning I was in my carriage.  Now you know all."
 
Elinor made no answer.  Her thoughts were silently fixed on the
irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent
habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in the mind, the
character, the happiness, of a man who, to every advantage of person
and talents, united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a
feeling, affectionate temper.  The world had made him extravagant and
vainExtravagance and vanity had made him coldhearted and selfish.
Vanity, while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another,
had involved him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least
its offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed.  Each faulty
propensity in leading him to evil, had led him likewise to punishment.
The attachment, from which against honour, against feeling, against
every better interest he had outwardly torn himself, now, when no
longer allowable, governed every thought and the connection, for the
sake of which he had, with little scruple, left her sister to misery,
was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more
incurable nature.  From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the
end of some minutes by Willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverie
at least equally painful, started up in preparation for going, and
said
 
"There is no use in staying here I must be off."
 
"Are you going back to town?"
 
"Noto Combe Magna.  I have business there from thence to town in a
day or two.  Good bye."
 
He held out his hand.  She could not refuse to give him hershe
pressed it with affection.
 
"And you DO think something better of me than you did?"said he,
letting it fall, and leaning against the mantelpiece as if forgetting
he was to go.
 
Elinor assured him that she didthat she forgave, pitied, wished him
wellwas even interested in his happinessand added some gentle
counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it.  His answer was
not very encouraging.
 
"As to that," said he, "I must rub through the world as well as I can.
Domestic happiness is out of the question.  If, however, I am allowed
to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions, it
may be the meansit may put me on my guardat least, it may be
something to live for.  Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever.
Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again"
 
Elinor stopped him with a reproof.
 
"Well,"he replied"once more good bye. I shall now go away and live
in dread of one event."
 
"What do you mean?"
 
"Your sisters marriage."
 
"You are very wrong.  She can never be more lost to you than she is
now."
 
"But she will be gained by some one else.  And if that some one should
be the very he whom, of all others, I could least bearbut I will not
stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill, by shewing that
where I have most injured I can least forgive.  Good bye,God bless
you!"
 
And with these words, he almost ran out of the room.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 45
 
 
Elinor, for some time after he left her, for some time even after the
sound of his carriage had died away, remained too much oppressed by a
crowd of ideas, widely differing in themselves, but of which sadness
was the general result, to think even of her sister.
 
Willoughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most
worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite of all his faults, excited a
degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them, which made
her think of him as now separated for ever from her family, with a
tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she soon acknowledged
within herselfto his wishes than to his merits.  She felt that his
influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not
in reason to have weight by that person of uncommon attraction, that
open, affectionate, and lively manner which it was no merit to possess
and by that still ardent love for Marianne, which it was not even
innocent to indulge.  But she felt that it was so, long, long before
she could feel his influence less.
 
When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne, she found her
just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of
her hopes.  Elinors heart was full.  The past, the present, the
future, Willoughbys visit, Mariannes safety, and her mothers
expected arrival, threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits
which kept off every indication of fatigue, and made her only fearful
of betraying herself to her sister.  Short was the time, however, in
which that fear could affect her, for within half an hour after
Willoughbys leaving the house, she was again called down stairs by the
sound of another carriage.Eager to save her mother from every
unnecessary moments horrible suspense, she ran immediately into the
hall, and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support
her as she entered it.
 
Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the house had produced
almost the conviction of Mariannes being no more, had no voice to
inquire after her, no voice even for Elinor but SHE, waiting neither
for salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful reliefand her
mother, catching it with all her usual warmth, was in a moment as much
overcome by her happiness, as she had been before by her fears.  She
was supported into the drawingroom between her daughter and her
friendand there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable to
speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her at intervals
to press Colonel Brandons hand, with a look which spoke at once her
gratitude, and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss
of the moment.  He shared it, however, in a silence even greater than
her own.
 
As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself, to see Marianne was her
first desire and in two minutes she was with her beloved child,
rendered dearer to her than ever by absence, unhappiness, and danger.
Elinors delight, as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only
checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther
sleepbut Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent, when
the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in knowing
her mother was near her, and conscious of being too weak for
conversation, submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by
every nurse around her.  Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night
and Elinor, in compliance with her mothers entreaty, went to bed.  But
the rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours of the
most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off by
irritation of spirits.  Willoughby, "poor Willoughby," as she now
allowed herself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts she would
not but have heard his vindication for the world, and now blamed, now
acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before.  But her
promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful.  She
dreaded the performance of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne
might be doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be
happy with another and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower.
Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself, felt that to HIS
sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rivals, the reward
of her sister was due, and wished any thing rather than Mrs.
Willoughbys death.
 
The shock of Colonel Brandons errand at Barton had been much softened
to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm for so great was her
uneasiness about Marianne, that she had already determined to set out
for Cleveland on that very day, without waiting for any further
intelligence, and had so far settled her journey before his arrival,
that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away,
as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection.
 
Marianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant cheerfulness of
Mrs. Dashwoods looks and spirits proved her to be, as she repeatedly
declared herself, one of the happiest women in the world.  Elinor could
not hear the declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes
wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward.  But Mrs.
Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment
which Elinor had sent her, was led away by the exuberance of her joy to
think only of what would increase it.  Marianne was restored to her
from a danger in which, as she now began to feel, her own mistaken
judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby, had
contributed to place herand in her recovery she had yet another
source of joy unthought of by Elinor.  It was thus imparted to her, as
soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred.
 
"At last we are alone.  My Elinor, you do not yet know all my
happiness.  Colonel Brandon loves Marianne.  He has told me so himself."
 
Her daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained, surprised and
not surprised, was all silent attention.
 
"You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should wonder at your
composure now.  Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my
family, I should have fixed on Colonel Brandons marrying one of you as
the object most desirable.  And I believe Marianne will be the most
happy with him of the two."
 
Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so, because
satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age,
characters, or feelings, could be givenbut her mother must always be
carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject, and
therefore instead of an inquiry, she passed it off with a smile.
 
"He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled.  It came
out quite unawares, quite undesignedly.  I, you may well believe, could
talk of nothing but my childhe could not conceal his distress I saw
that it equalled my own, and he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship,
as the world now goes, would not justify so warm a sympathyor rather,
not thinking at all, I supposegiving way to irresistible feelings,
made me acquainted with his earnest, tender, constant, affection for
Marianne.  He has loved her, my Elinor, ever since the first moment of
seeing her."
 
Here, however, Elinor perceived,not the language, not the professions
of Colonel Brandon, but the natural embellishments of her mothers
active fancy, which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose.
 
"His regard for her, infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby
ever felt or feigned, as much more warm, as more sincere or
constantwhich ever we are to call ithas subsisted through all the
knowledge of dear Mariannes unhappy prepossession for that worthless
young man!and without selfishnesswithout encouraging a hope!could
he have seen her happy with anotherSuch a noble mind!such openness,
such sincerity!no one can be deceived in HIM."
 
"Colonel Brandons character," said Elinor, "as an excellent man, is
well established."
 
"I know it is,"replied her mother seriously, "or after such a warning,
I should be the last to encourage such affection, or even to be pleased
by it.  But his coming for me as he did, with such active, such ready
friendship, is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men."
 
"His character, however," answered Elinor, "does not rest on ONE act of
kindness, to which his affection for Marianne, were humanity out of the
case, would have prompted him.  To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, he
has been long and intimately known they equally love and respect him
and even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired, is very
considerable and so highly do I value and esteem him, that if Marianne
can be happy with him, I shall be as ready as yourself to think our
connection the greatest blessing to us in the world.  What answer did
you give him?Did you allow him to hope?"
 
"Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself.
Marianne might at that moment be dying.  But he did not ask for hope or
encouragement.  His was an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible
effusion to a soothing friendnot an application to a parent.  Yet
after a time I DID say, for at first I was quite overcomethat if she
lived, as I trusted she might, my greatest happiness would lie in
promoting their marriage and since our arrival, since our delightful
security, I have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every
encouragement in my power.  Time, a very little time, I tell him, will
do everythingMariannes heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a
man as Willoughby. His own merits must soon secure it."
 
"To judge from the Colonels spirits, however, you have not yet made
him equally sanguine."
 
"No.He thinks Mariannes affection too deeply rooted for any change
in it under a great length of time, and even supposing her heart again
free, is too diffident of himself to believe, that with such a
difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her.  There,
however, he is quite mistaken.  His age is only so much beyond hers as
to be an advantage, as to make his character and principles fixedand
his disposition, I am well convinced, is exactly the very one to make
your sister happy.  And his person, his manners too, are all in his
favour.  My partiality does not blind me he certainly is not so
handsome as Willoughbybut at the same time, there is something much
more pleasing in his countenance. There was always a something,if
you remember,in Willoughbys eyes at times, which I did not like."
 
Elinor could NOT remember itbut her mother, without waiting for her
assent, continued,
 
"And his manners, the Colonels manners are not only more pleasing to
me than Willoughbys ever were, but they are of a kind I well know to
be more solidly attaching to Marianne.  Their gentleness, their genuine
attention to other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity is much
more accordant with her real disposition, than the livelinessoften
artificial, and often illtimed of the other.  I am very sure myself,
that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable, as he has proved
himself the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been so happy with
HIM, as she will be with Colonel Brandon."
 
She paused.Her daughter could not quite agree with her, but her
dissent was not heard, and therefore gave no offence.
 
"At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me," added Mrs.
Dashwood, "even if I remain at Barton and in all probability,for I
hear it is a large village,indeed there certainly MUST be some small
house or cottage close by, that would suit us quite as well as our
present situation."
 
Poor Elinor!here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford!but
her spirit was stubborn.
 
"His fortune too!for at my time of life you know, everybody cares
about THATand though I neither know nor desire to know, what it
really is, I am sure it must be a good one."
 
Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person, and
Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private, to wish success to her
friend, and yet in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 46
 
 
Mariannes illness, though weakening in its kind, had not been long
enough to make her recovery slow and with youth, natural strength, and
her mothers presence in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her
to remove, within four days after the arrival of the latter, into Mrs.
Palmers dressingroom.  When there, at her own particular request, for
she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her
mother, Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her.
 
His emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered looks, and in
receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him, was
such, as, in Elinors conjecture, must arise from something more than
his affection for Marianne, or the consciousness of its being known to
others and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying
complexion as he looked at her sister, the probable recurrence of many
past scenes of misery to his mind, brought back by that resemblance
between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now strengthened
by the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,
and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.
 
Mrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than her daughter, but
with a mind very differently influenced, and therefore watching to very
different effect, saw nothing in the Colonels behaviour but what arose
from the most simple and selfevident sensations, while in the actions
and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that something
more than gratitude already dawned.
 
At the end of another day or two, Marianne growing visibly stronger
every twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood, urged equally by her own and her
daughters wishes, began to talk of removing to Barton.  On HER
measures depended those of her two friends Mrs. Jennings could not
quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods stay and Colonel Brandon was soon
brought, by their united request, to consider his own abode there as
equally determinate, if not equally indispensable.  At his and Mrs.
Jenningss united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to
accept the use of his carriage on her journey back, for the better
accommodation of her sick child and the Colonel, at the joint
invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings, whose active goodnature
made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself,
engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in the
course of a few weeks.
 
The day of separation and departure arrived and Marianne, after taking
so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly
grateful, so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own
heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding
Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was carefully
assisted by him into the carriage, of which he seemed anxious that she
should engross at least half.  Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed,
and the others were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers, and
feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her chaise
to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young
companions and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his
solitary way to Delaford.
 
The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne bore her journey
on both, without essential fatigue.  Every thing that the most zealous
affection, the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable,
was the office of each watchful companion, and each found their reward
in her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits.  To Elinor, the
observation of the latter was particularly grateful.  She, who had seen
her week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish of
heart which she had neither courage to speak of, nor fortitude to
conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally share, an
apparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as she trusted
of serious reflection, must eventually lead her to contentment and
cheerfulness.
 
As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which every
field and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful recollection,
she grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her face from their
notice, sat earnestly gazing through the window.  But here, Elinor
could neither wonder nor blame and when she saw, as she assisted
Marianne from the carriage, that she had been crying, she saw only an
emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity,
and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise.  In the whole of her
subsequent manner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened to
reasonable exertion for no sooner had they entered their common
sittingroom, than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of
resolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the
sight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be
connected.She said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness,
and though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed away without
the atonement of a smile.  After dinner she would try her pianoforte.
She went to it but the music on which her eye first rested was an
opera, procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their
favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his
handwriting.That would not do.She shook her head, put the music
aside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained of
feebleness in her fingers, and closed the instrument again declaring
however with firmness as she did so, that she should in future practice
much.
 
The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms.  On the
contrary, with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she looked
and spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of
Margarets return, and talking of the dear family party which would
then be restored, of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society, as the
only happiness worth a wish.
 
"When the weather is settled, and I have recovered my strength," said
she, "we will take long walks together every day.  We will walk to the
farm at the edge of the down, and see how the children go on we will
walk to Sir Johns new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland
and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory, and try to trace its
foundations as far as we are told they once reached.  I know we shall
be happy.  I know the summer will pass happily away.  I mean never to
be later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner I shall
divide every moment between music and reading.  I have formed my plan,
and am determined to enter on a course of serious study.  Our own
library is too well known to me, to be resorted to for any thing beyond
mere amusement.  But there are many works well worth reading at the
Park and there are others of more modern production which I know I can
borrow of Colonel Brandon.  By reading only six hours aday, I shall
gain in the course of a twelvemonth a great deal of instruction which
I now feel myself to want."
 
Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this
though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her
to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at work
in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and
virtuous selfcontrol. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she
remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and feared
she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of
Marianne, and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy
tranquillity.  Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she resolved
to wait till her sisters health were more secure, before she appointed
it.  But the resolution was made only to be broken.
 
Marianne had been two or three days at home, before the weather was
fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out.  But at last a
soft, genial morning appeared such as might tempt the daughters
wishes and the mothers confidence and Marianne, leaning on Elinors
arm, was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue, in
the lane before the house.
 
The sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness of Marianne in an
exercise hitherto untried since her illness requiredand they had
advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the
hill, the important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes turned
towards it, Marianne calmly said,
 
"There, exactly there,"pointing with one hand, "on that projecting
mound,there I fell and there I first saw Willoughby."
 
Her voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she added,
 
"I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the
spot!shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?"hesitatingly it
was said."Or will it be wrong?I can talk of it now, I hope, as I
ought to do."
 
Elinor tenderly invited her to be open.
 
"As for regret," said Marianne, "I have done with that, as far as HE is
concerned.  I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been
for him, but what they are NOW.At present, if I could be satisfied on
one point, if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS acting
a part, not ALWAYS deceiving mebut above all, if I could be assured
that he never was so VERY wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied
him, since the story of that unfortunate girl"
 
She stopt.  Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered,
 
"If you could be assured of that, you think you should be easy."
 
"Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in itfor not only is it
horrible to suspect a person, who has been what HE has been to ME, of
such designs,but what must it make me appear to myself?What in a
situation like mine, but a most shamefully unguarded affection could
expose me to"
 
"How then," asked her sister, "would you account for his behaviour?"
 
"I would suppose him,Oh, how gladly would I suppose him, only fickle,
very, very fickle."
 
Elinor said no more.  She was debating within herself on the
eligibility of beginning her story directly, or postponing it till
Marianne were in stronger healthand they crept on for a few minutes
in silence.
 
"I am not wishing him too much good," said Marianne at last with a
sigh, "when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant
than my own.  He will suffer enough in them."
 
"Do you compare your conduct with his?"
 
"No. I compare it with what it ought to have been I compare it with
yours."
 
"Our situations have borne little resemblance."
 
"They have borne more than our conduct.Do not, my dearest Elinor, let
your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure.  My
illness has made me think It has given me leisure and calmness for
serious recollection.  Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I
was perfectly able to reflect.  I considered the past I saw in my own
behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last
autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of
kindness to others.  I saw that my own feelings had prepared my
sufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me
to the grave.  My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by
myself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the
time to be wrong.  Had I died,it would have been selfdestruction. I
did not know my danger till the danger was removed but with such
feelings as these reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery,wonder
that the very eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for
atonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once.  Had I
died,in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse, my
friend, my sister!You, who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my
latter days who had known all the murmurings of my heart!How should
I have lived in YOUR remembrance!My mother too! How could you have
consoled her!I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself.  Whenever
I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing
indulged.  Every body seemed injured by me.  The kindness, the
unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful
contempt.  To the Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every
common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust with a heart
hardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their very
attention.To John, to Fanny,yes, even to them, little as they
deserve, I had given less than their due.  But you,you above all,
above my mother, had been wronged by me.  I, and only I, knew your
heart and its sorrows yet to what did it influence me?not to any
compassion that could benefit you or myself.Your example was before
me but to what avail?Was I more considerate of you and your comfort?
Did I imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking
any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular
gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge
alone?Nonot less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I had
believed you at ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty or
friendship scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regretting
only THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for
whom I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake."
 
Here ceased the rapid flow of her selfreproving spirit and Elinor,
impatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her instantly
that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well
deserved.  Marianne pressed her hand and replied,
 
"You are very good.The future must be my proof.  I have laid down my
plan, and if I am capable of adhering to itmy feelings shall be
governed and my temper improved.  They shall no longer worry others,
nor torture myself.  I shall now live solely for my family.  You, my
mother, and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me you will
share my affections entirely between you.  From you, from my home, I
shall never again have the smallest incitement to move and if I do mix
in other society, it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled, my
heart amended, and that I can practise the civilities, the lesser
duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance.  As for Willoughbyto
say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him, would be idle.
His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or
opinions.  But it shall be regulated, it shall be checked by religion,
by reason, by constant employment."
 
She pausedand added in a low voice, "If I could but know HIS heart,
everything would become easy."
 
Elinor, who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or
impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration, without feeling at all
nearer decision than at first, heard this and perceiving that as
reflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself
leading to the fact.
 
She managed the recital, as she hoped, with address prepared her
anxious listener with caution related simply and honestly the chief
points on which Willoughby grounded his apology did justice to his
repentance, and softened only his protestations of present regard.
Marianne said not a word.She trembled, her eyes were fixed on the
ground, and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them.  A
thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge
one.  She caught every syllable with panting eagerness her hand,
unknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sisters, and tears covered
her cheeks.
 
Elinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards home and till they
reached the door of the cottage, easily conjecturing what her curiosity
must be though no question was suffered to speak it, talked of nothing
but Willoughby, and their conversation together and was carefully
minute in every particular of speech and look, where minuteness could
be safely indulged.  As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a
kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her
tears, "Tell mama," withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up
stairs.  Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable
as what she now sought and with a mind anxiously prearranging its
result, and a resolution of reviving the subject again, should Marianne
fail to do it, she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting
injunction.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 47
 
 
Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former
favourite.  She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his
imputed guiltshe was sorry for himshe wished him happy.  But the
feelings of the past could not be recalled.Nothing could restore him
with a faith unbrokena character unblemished, to Marianne.  Nothing
could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his
means, nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza.  Nothing
could replace him, therefore, in her former esteem, nor injure the
interests of Colonel Brandon.
 
Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughbys story from
himselfhad she witnessed his distress, and been under the influence
of his countenance and his manner, it is probable that her compassion
would have been greater.  But it was neither in Elinors power, nor in
her wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her retailed
explanation, as had at first been called forth in herself.  Reflection
had given calmness to her judgment, and sobered her own opinion of
Willoughbys desertsshe wished, therefore, to declare only the
simple truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to his
character, without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy
astray.
 
In the evening, when they were all three together, Marianne began
voluntarily to speak of him againbut that it was not without an
effort, the restless, unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for
some time previously sittingher rising colour, as she spoke,and her
unsteady voice, plainly shewed.
 
"I wish to assure you both," said she, "that I see every thingas you
can desire me to do."
 
Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing
tenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished to hear her sisters
unbiased opinion, by an eager sign, engaged her silence.  Marianne
slowly continued
 
"It is a great relief to mewhat Elinor told me this morningI have
now heard exactly what I wished to hear."For some moments her voice
was lost but recovering herself, she added, and with greater calmness
than before"I am now perfectly satisfied, I wish for no change.  I
never could have been happy with him, after knowing, as sooner or later
I must have known, all this.I should have had no confidence, no
esteem.  Nothing could have done it away to my feelings."
 
"I know itI know it," cried her mother.  "Happy with a man of
libertine practices!With one who so injured the peace of the dearest
of our friends, and the best of men!Nomy Marianne has not a heart
to be made happy with such a man!Her conscience, her sensitive
conscience, would have felt all that the conscience of her husband
ought to have felt."
 
Marianne sighed, and repeated, "I wish for no change."
 
"You consider the matter," said Elinor, "exactly as a good mind and a
sound understanding must consider it and I dare say you perceive, as
well as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances,
reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you
in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would have
been poorly supported by an affection, on his side, much less certain.
Had you married, you must have been always poor.  His expensiveness is
acknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares that
selfdenial is a word hardly understood by him.  His demands and your
inexperience together, on a small, very small income, must have brought
on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you, from having
been entirely unknown and unthought of before.  YOUR sense of honour
and honesty would have led you, I know, when aware of your situation,
to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible and,
perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort,
you might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond thatand how
little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin
which had begun before your marriage? Beyond THAT, had you
endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge HIS enjoyments, is it not
to be feared, that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to
consent to it, you would have lessened your own influence on his heart,
and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such
difficulties?"
 
Mariannes lips quivered, and she repeated the word "Selfish?" in a
tone that implied"do you really think him selfish?"
 
"The whole of his behaviour," replied Elinor, "from the beginning to
the end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness.  It was
selfishness which first made him sport with your affections which
afterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession of
it, and which finally carried him from Barton.  His own enjoyment, or
his own ease, was, in every particular, his ruling principle."
 
"It is very true.  MY happiness never was his object."
 
"At present," continued Elinor, "he regrets what he has done.  And why
does he regret it?Because he finds it has not answered towards
himself.  It has not made him happy.  His circumstances are now
unembarrassedhe suffers from no evil of that kind and he thinks only
that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself.
But does it follow that had he married you, he would have been
happy?The inconveniences would have been different.  He would then
have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they are
removed, he now reckons as nothing.  He would have had a wife of whose
temper he could make no complaint, but he would have been always
necessitousalways poor and probably would soon have learned to rank
the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far
more importance, even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a
wife."
 
"I have not a doubt of it," said Marianne "and I have nothing to
regretnothing but my own folly."
 
"Rather say your mothers imprudence, my child," said Mrs. Dashwood
"SHE must be answerable."
 
Marianne would not let her proceedand Elinor, satisfied that each
felt their own error, wished to avoid any survey of the past that might
weaken her sisters spirits she, therefore, pursuing the first
subject, immediately continued,
 
"One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from the whole of the
storythat all Willoughbys difficulties have arisen from the first
offence against virtue, in his behaviour to Eliza Williams.  That crime
has been the origin of every lesser one, and of all his present
discontents."
 
Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark and her mother was led
by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandons injuries and merits, warm
as friendship and design could unitedly dictate.  Her daughter did not
look, however, as if much of it were heard by her.
 
Elinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two or three following
days, that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done
but while her resolution was unsubdued, and she still tried to appear
cheerful and easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect of time
upon her health.
 
Margaret returned, and the family were again all restored to each
other, again quietly settled at the cottage and if not pursuing their
usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to
Barton, at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.
 
Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward.  She had heard
nothing of him since her leaving London, nothing new of his plans,
nothing certain even of his present abode.  Some letters had passed
between her and her brother, in consequence of Mariannes illness and
in the first of Johns, there had been this sentence "We know
nothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no enquiries on so
prohibited a subject, but conclude him to be still at Oxford" which
was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence,
for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters.
She was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of his measures.
 
Their manservant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business and
when, as he waited at table, he had satisfied the inquiries of his
mistress as to the event of his errand, this was his voluntary
communication
 
"I suppose you know, maam, that Mr. Ferrars is married."
 
Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes upon Elinor, saw her
turning pale, and fell back in her chair in hysterics.  Mrs. Dashwood,
whose eyes, as she answered the servants inquiry, had intuitively
taken the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinors
countenance how much she really suffered, and a moment afterwards,
alike distressed by Mariannes situation, knew not on which child to
bestow her principal attention.
 
The servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill, had sense
enough to call one of the maids, who, with Mrs. Dashwoods assistance,
supported her into the other room.  By that time, Marianne was rather
better, and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the
maid, returned to Elinor, who, though still much disordered, had so far
recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an
inquiry of Thomas, as to the source of his intelligence.  Mrs. Dashwood
immediately took all that trouble on herself and Elinor had the
benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it.
 
"Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?"
 
"I see Mr. Ferrars myself, maam, this morning in Exeter, and his lady
too, Miss Steele as was.  They was stopping in a chaise at the door of
the New London Inn, as I went there with a message from Sally at the
Park to her brother, who is one of the postboys. I happened to look up
as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss
Steele so I took off my hat, and she knew me and called to me, and
inquired after you, maam, and the young ladies, especially Miss
Marianne, and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrarss,
their best compliments and service, and how sorry they was they had not
time to come on and see you, but they was in a great hurry to go
forwards, for they was going further down for a little while, but
howsever, when they come back, theyd make sure to come and see you."
 
"But did she tell you she was married, Thomas?"
 
"Yes, maam. She smiled, and said how she had changed her name since
she was in these parts.  She was always a very affable and freespoken
young lady, and very civil behaved.  So, I made free to wish her joy."
 
"Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?"
 
"Yes, maam, I just see him leaning back in it, but he did not look
uphe never was a gentleman much for talking."
 
Elinors heart could easily account for his not putting himself
forward and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation.
 
"Was there no one else in the carriage?"
 
"No, maam, only they two."
 
"Do you know where they came from?"
 
"They come straight from town, as Miss LucyMrs. Ferrars told me."
 
"And are they going farther westward?"
 
"Yes, maambut not to bide long.  They will soon be back again, and
then theyd be sure and call here."
 
Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter but Elinor knew better than
to expect them.  She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and
was very confident that Edward would never come near them.  She
observed in a low voice, to her mother, that they were probably going
down to Mr. Pratts, near Plymouth.
 
Thomass intelligence seemed over.  Elinor looked as if she wished to
hear more.
 
"Did you see them off, before you came away?"
 
"No, maamthe horses were just coming out, but I could not bide any
longer I was afraid of being late."
 
"Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?"
 
"Yes, maam, she said how she was very well and to my mind she was
always a very handsome young ladyand she seemed vastly contented."
 
Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question, and Thomas and the
tablecloth, now alike needless, were soon afterwards dismissed.
Marianne had already sent to say, that she should eat nothing more.
Mrs. Dashwoods and Elinors appetites were equally lost, and Margaret
might think herself very well off, that with so much uneasiness as both
her sisters had lately experienced, so much reason as they had often
had to be careless of their meals, she had never been obliged to go
without her dinner before.
 
When the dessert and the wine were arranged, and Mrs. Dashwood and
Elinor were left by themselves, they remained long together in a
similarity of thoughtfulness and silence.  Mrs. Dashwood feared to
hazard any remark, and ventured not to offer consolation.  She now
found that she had erred in relying on Elinors representation of
herself and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly
softened at the time, to spare her from an increase of unhappiness,
suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne.  She found that she
had been misled by the careful, the considerate attention of her
daughter, to think the attachment, which once she had so well
understood, much slighter in reality, than she had been wont to
believe, or than it was now proved to be.  She feared that under this
persuasion she had been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to her
Elinorthat Mariannes affliction, because more acknowledged, more
immediately before her, had too much engrossed her tenderness, and led
her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering
almost as much, certainly with less selfprovocation, and greater
fortitude.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 48
 
 
Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an
unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told to consider it,
and certainty itself.  She now found, that in spite of herself, she had
always admitted a hope, while Edward remained single, that something
would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy that some resolution of his
own, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible opportunity of
establishment for the lady, would arise to assist the happiness of all.
But he was now married and she condemned her heart for the lurking
flattery, which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence.
 
That he should be married soon, before as she imagined he could be in
orders, and consequently before he could be in possession of the
living, surprised her a little at first.  But she soon saw how likely
it was that Lucy, in her selfprovident care, in her haste to secure
him, should overlook every thing but the risk of delay.  They were
married, married in town, and now hastening down to her uncles.  What
had Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton, on seeing her
mothers servant, on hearing Lucys message!
 
They would soon, she supposed, be settled at Delaford.Delaford,that
place in which so much conspired to give her an interest which she
wished to be acquainted with, and yet desired to avoid.  She saw them
in an instant in their parsonagehouse saw in Lucy, the active,
contriving manager, uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with
the utmost frugality, and ashamed to be suspected of half her
economical practicespursuing her own interest in every thought,
courting the favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of every
wealthy friend.  In Edwardshe knew not what she saw, nor what she
wished to seehappy or unhappy,nothing pleased her she turned away
her head from every sketch of him.
 
Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London
would write to them to announce the event, and give farther
particulars,but day after day passed off, and brought no letter, no
tidings.  Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she found fault
with every absent friend.  They were all thoughtless or indolent.
 
"When do you write to Colonel Brandon, maam?" was an inquiry which
sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on.
 
"I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather expect to see, than to
hear from him again.  I earnestly pressed his coming to us, and should
not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day."
 
This was gaining something, something to look forward to.  Colonel
Brandon must have some information to give.
 
Scarcely had she so determined it, when the figure of a man on
horseback drew her eyes to the window.  He stopt at their gate.  It was
a gentleman, it was Colonel Brandon himself.  Now she could hear more
and she trembled in expectation of it.  Butit was NOT Colonel
Brandonneither his airnor his height.  Were it possible, she must
say it must be Edward.  She looked again.  He had just dismountedshe
could not be mistaken,it WAS Edward.  She moved away and sat down.
"He comes from Mr. Pratts purposely to see us.  I WILL be calm I WILL
be mistress of myself."
 
In a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the
mistake.  She saw her mother and Marianne change colour saw them look
at herself, and whisper a few sentences to each other.  She would have
given the world to be able to speakand to make them understand that
she hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear in their behaviour to
himbut she had no utterance, and was obliged to leave all to their
own discretion.
 
Not a syllable passed aloud.  They all waited in silence for the
appearance of their visitor.  His footsteps were heard along the gravel
path in a moment he was in the passage, and in another he was before
them.
 
His countenance, as he entered the room, was not too happy, even for
Elinor.  His complexion was white with agitation, and he looked as if
fearful of his reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one.
Mrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted, to the wishes of
that daughter, by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be
guided in every thing, met with a look of forced complacency, gave him
her hand, and wished him joy.
 
He coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply.  Elinors lips
had moved with her mothers, and, when the moment of action was over,
she wished that she had shaken hands with him too.  But it was then too
late, and with a countenance meaning to be open, she sat down again and
talked of the weather.
 
Marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight, to conceal her
distress and Margaret, understanding some part, but not the whole of
the case, thought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and therefore
took a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained a strict
silence.
 
When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season, a very
awful pause took place.  It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who
felt obliged to hope that he had left Mrs. Ferrars very well.  In a
hurried manner, he replied in the affirmative.
 
Another pause.
 
Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of her own
voice, now said,
 
"Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?"
 
"At Longstaple!" he replied, with an air of surprise. "No, my mother
is in town."
 
"I meant," said Elinor, taking up some work from the table, "to inquire
for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars."
 
She dared not look upbut her mother and Marianne both turned their
eyes on him.  He coloured, seemed perplexed, looked doubtingly, and,
after some hesitation, said,
 
"Perhaps you meanmy brotheryou mean Mrs.Mrs. ROBERT Ferrars."
 
"Mrs. Robert Ferrars!"was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an
accent of the utmost amazementand though Elinor could not speak,
even HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder.  He
rose from his seat, and walked to the window, apparently from not
knowing what to do took up a pair of scissors that lay there, and
while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to
pieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice,
 
"Perhaps you do not knowyou may not have heard that my brother is
lately married toto the youngestto Miss Lucy Steele."
 
His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor,
who sat with her head leaning over her work, in a state of such
agitation as made her hardly know where she was.
 
"Yes," said he, "they were married last week, and are now at Dawlish."
 
Elinor could sit it no longer.  She almost ran out of the room, and as
soon as the door was closed, burst into tears of joy, which at first
she thought would never cease.  Edward, who had till then looked any
where, rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps sawor even
heard, her emotion for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie,
which no remarks, no inquiries, no affectionate address of Mrs.
Dashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word, quitted
the room, and walked out towards the villageleaving the others in the
greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation, so
wonderful and so suddena perplexity which they had no means of
lessening but by their own conjectures.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 49
 
 
Unaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his release might
appear to the whole family, it was certain that Edward was free and to
what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily predetermined
by allfor after experiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent
engagement, contracted without his mothers consent, as he had already
done for more than four years, nothing less could be expected of him in
the failure of THAT, than the immediate contraction of another.
 
His errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one.  It was only to ask
Elinor to marry himand considering that he was not altogether
inexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he should
feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did, so much in
need of encouragement and fresh air.
 
How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution, however, how
soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred, in what manner he
expressed himself, and how he was received, need not be particularly
told.  This only need be saidthat when they all sat down to table at
four oclock, about three hours after his arrival, he had secured his
lady, engaged her mothers consent, and was not only in the rapturous
profession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one
of the happiest of men.  His situation indeed was more than commonly
joyful.  He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to
swell his heart, and raise his spirits.  He was released without any
reproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his
misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to loveand elevated at
once to that security with another, which he must have thought of
almost with despair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it with
desire.  He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from misery to
happinessand the change was openly spoken in such a genuine,
flowing, grateful cheerfulness, as his friends had never witnessed in
him before.
 
His heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses, all its errors
confessed, and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the
philosophic dignity of twentyfour.
 
"It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side," said he, "the
consequence of ignorance of the worldand want of employment.  Had my
brother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen
from the care of Mr. Pratt, I thinknay, I am sure, it would never
have happened for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at the
time, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I then had
any pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance
from her for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown the fancied
attachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as in such case I
must have done.  But instead of having any thing to do, instead of
having any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any
myself, I returned home to be completely idle and for the first
twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment, which
belonging to the university would have given me for I was not entered
at Oxford till I was nineteen.  I had therefore nothing in the world to
do, but to fancy myself in love and as my mother did not make my home
in every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no companion in my
brother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not unnatural for me to
be very often at Longstaple, where I always felt myself at home, and
was always sure of a welcome and accordingly I spent the greatest part
of my time there from eighteen to nineteen Lucy appeared everything
that was amiable and obliging.  She was pretty tooat least I thought
so THEN and I had seen so little of other women, that I could make no
comparisons, and see no defects.  Considering everything, therefore, I
hope, foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since in every
way been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable
piece of folly."
 
The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness
of the Dashwoods, was suchso greatas promised them all, the
satisfaction of a sleepless night.  Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be
comfortable, knew not how to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough, how
to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy,
nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation
together, and yet enjoy, as she wished, the sight and society of both.
 
Marianne could speak HER happiness only by tears.  Comparisons would
occurregrets would ariseand her joy, though sincere as her love
for her sister, was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language.
 
But Elinorhow are HER feelings to be described?From the moment of
learning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was free, to the
moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed, she
was every thing by turns but tranquil.  But when the second moment had
passed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude removed, compared
her situation with what so lately it had been,saw him honourably
released from his former engagement, saw him instantly profiting by the
release, to address herself and declare an affection as tender, as
constant as she had ever supposed it to be,she was oppressed, she was
overcome by her own felicityand happily disposed as is the human
mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better, it
required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits, or any degree
of tranquillity to her heart.
 
Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a weekfor whatever
other claims might be made on him, it was impossible that less than a
week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinors company, or
suffice to say half that was to be said of the past, the present, and
the futurefor though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of
incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in
common between any two rational creatures, yet with lovers it is
different.  Between THEM no subject is finished, no communication is
even made, till it has been made at least twenty times over.
 
Lucys marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all,
formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the loversand
Elinors particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in
every view, as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable
circumstances she had ever heard.  How they could be thrown together,
and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl, of
whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,a
girl too already engaged to his brother, and on whose account that
brother had been thrown off by his familyit was beyond her
comprehension to make out.  To her own heart it was a delightful
affair, to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to her
reason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.
 
Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps,
at first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so worked
on by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest.
Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street, of his
opinion of what his own mediation in his brothers affairs might have
done, if applied to in time.  She repeated it to Edward.
 
"THAT was exactly like Robert,"was his immediate observation."And
THAT," he presently added, "might perhaps be in HIS head when the
acquaintance between them first began.  And Lucy perhaps at first might
think only of procuring his good offices in my favour.  Other designs
might afterward arise."
 
How long it had been carrying on between them, however, he was equally
at a loss with herself to make out for at Oxford, where he had
remained for choice ever since his quitting London, he had had no means
of hearing of her but from herself, and her letters to the very last
were neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual.  Not the
smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to prepare him for
what followedand when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy
herself, he had been for some time, he believed, half stupified between
the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance.  He put the
letter into Elinors hands.
 
     "DEAR SIR,
 
     "Being very sure I have long lost your affections,
     I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own
     on another, and have no doubt of being as happy with
     him as I once used to think I might be with you
     but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was
     anothers.  Sincerely wish you happy in your choice,
     and it shall not be my fault if we are not always
     good friends, as our near relationship now makes
     proper.  I can safely say I owe you no illwill,
     and am sure you will be too generous to do us any
     ill offices.  Your brother has gained my affections
     entirely, and as we could not live without one
     another, we are just returned from the altar, and
     are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks, which
     place your dear brother has great curiosity to see,
     but thought I would first trouble you with these
     few lines, and shall always remain,
 
     "Your sincere wellwisher, friend, and sister,
                                        "LUCY FERRARS.
 
     "I have burnt all your letters, and will return
     your picture the first opportunity.  Please to destroy
     my scrawlsbut the ring with my hair you are very
     welcome to keep."
 
Elinor read and returned it without any comment.
 
"I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition," said
Edward."For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by YOU
in former days.In a sister it is bad enough, but in a wife!how I
have blushed over the pages of her writing!and I believe I may say
that since the first half year of our foolishbusinessthis is the
only letter I ever received from her, of which the substance made me
any amends for the defect of the style."
 
"However it may have come about," said Elinor, after a pause,"they
are certainly married.  And your mother has brought on herself a most
appropriate punishment.  The independence she settled on Robert,
through resentment against you, has put it in his power to make his own
choice and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand
ayear, to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for
intending to do.  She will hardly be less hurt, I suppose, by Roberts
marrying Lucy, than she would have been by your marrying her."
 
"She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always was her favourite.She
will be more hurt by it, and on the same principle will forgive him
much sooner."
 
In what state the affair stood at present between them, Edward knew
not, for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted
by him.  He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after
Lucys letter arrived, and with only one object before him, the nearest
road to Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct, with
which that road did not hold the most intimate connection.  He could do
nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood and by his
rapidity in seeking THAT fate, it is to be supposed, in spite of the
jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon, in spite of
the modesty with which he rated his own deserts, and the politeness
with which he talked of his doubts, he did not, upon the whole, expect
a very cruel reception.  It was his business, however, to say that he
DID, and he said it very prettily.  What he might say on the subject a
twelvemonth after, must be referred to the imagination of husbands and
wives.
 
That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off with a flourish of
malice against him in her message by Thomas, was perfectly clear to
Elinor and Edward himself, now thoroughly enlightened on her
character, had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost
meanness of wanton illnature. Though his eyes had been long opened,
even before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her ignorance and a
want of liberality in some of her opinionsthey had been equally
imputed, by him, to her want of education and till her last letter
reached him, he had always believed her to be a welldisposed,
goodhearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself.  Nothing but
such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an
engagement, which, long before the discovery of it laid him open to his
mothers anger, had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to
him.
 
"I thought it my duty," said he, "independent of my feelings, to give
her the option of continuing the engagement or not, when I was
renounced by my mother, and stood to all appearance without a friend in
the world to assist me.  In such a situation as that, where there
seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living
creature, how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly
insisted on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing but
the most disinterested affection was her inducement?  And even now, I
cannot comprehend on what motive she acted, or what fancied advantage
it could be to her, to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the
smallest regard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the world.
She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living."
 
"No but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour
that your own family might in time relent.  And at any rate, she lost
nothing by continuing the engagement, for she has proved that it
fettered neither her inclination nor her actions.  The connection was
certainly a respectable one, and probably gained her consideration
among her friends and, if nothing more advantageous occurred, it would
be better for her to marry YOU than be single."
 
Edward was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could have
been more natural than Lucys conduct, nor more selfevident than the
motive of it.
 
Elinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which
compliments themselves, for having spent so much time with them at
Norland, when he must have felt his own inconstancy.
 
"Your behaviour was certainly very wrong," said she "becauseto say
nothing of my own conviction, our relations were all led away by it to
fancy and expect WHAT, as you were THEN situated, could never be."
 
He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart, and a mistaken
confidence in the force of his engagement.
 
"I was simple enough to think, that because my FAITH was plighted to
another, there could be no danger in my being with you and that the
consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred
as my honour.  I felt that I admired you, but I told myself it was only
friendship and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and
Lucy, I did not know how far I was got.  After that, I suppose, I WAS
wrong in remaining so much in Sussex, and the arguments with which I
reconciled myself to the expediency of it, were no better than
theseThe danger is my own I am doing no injury to anybody but
myself."
 
Elinor smiled, and shook her head.
 
Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandons being expected at the
Cottage, as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him,
but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented
his giving him the living of Delaford"Which, at present," said he,
"after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion,
he must think I have never forgiven him for offering."
 
NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place.
But so little interest had he taken in the matter, that he owed all his
knowledge of the house, garden, and glebe, extent of the parish,
condition of the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor herself, who
had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon, and heard it with so much
attention, as to be entirely mistress of the subject.
 
One question after this only remained undecided, between them, one
difficulty only was to be overcome.  They were brought together by
mutual affection, with the warmest approbation of their real friends
their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness
certainand they only wanted something to live upon.  Edward had two
thousand pounds, and Elinor one, which, with Delaford living, was all
that they could call their own for it was impossible that Mrs.
Dashwood should advance anything and they were neither of them quite
enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds ayear
would supply them with the comforts of life.
 
Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his
mother towards him and on THAT he rested for the residue of their
income.  But Elinor had no such dependence for since Edward would
still be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself had been
spoken of in Mrs. Ferrarss flattering language as only a lesser evil
than his chusing Lucy Steele, she feared that Roberts offence would
serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny.
 
About four days after Edwards arrival Colonel Brandon appeared, to
complete Mrs. Dashwoods satisfaction, and to give her the dignity of
having, for the first time since her living at Barton, more company
with her than her house would hold.  Edward was allowed to retain the
privilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every
night to his old quarters at the Park from whence he usually returned
in the morning, early enough to interrupt the lovers first teteatete
before breakfast.
 
A three weeks residence at Delaford, where, in his evening hours at
least, he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between
thirtysix and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind
which needed all the improvement in Mariannes looks, all the kindness
of her welcome, and all the encouragement of her mothers language, to
make it cheerful.  Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he
did revive.  No rumour of Lucys marriage had yet reached himhe knew
nothing of what had passed and the first hours of his visit were
consequently spent in hearing and in wondering.  Every thing was
explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood, and he found fresh reason to rejoice
in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the
interest of Elinor.
 
It would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced in the good
opinion of each other, as they advanced in each others acquaintance,
for it could not be otherwise.  Their resemblance in good principles
and good sense, in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably
have been sufficient to unite them in friendship, without any other
attraction but their being in love with two sisters, and two sisters
fond of each other, made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate,
which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment.
 
The letters from town, which a few days before would have made every
nerve in Elinors body thrill with transport, now arrived to be read
with less emotion than mirth.  Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the
wonderful tale, to vent her honest indignation against the jilting
girl, and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she
was sure, had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now, by all
accounts, almost brokenhearted, at Oxford. "I do think," she
continued, "nothing was ever carried on so sly for it was but two days
before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me.  Not a soul
suspected anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul!  came
crying to me the day after, in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars,
as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth for Lucy it seems
borrowed all her money before she went off to be married, on purpose we
suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in
the worldso I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her
down to Exeter, where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with
Mrs. Burgess, in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor
again.  And I must say that Lucys crossness not to take them along
with them in the chaise is worse than all.  Poor Mr. Edward! I cannot
get him out of my head, but you must send for him to Barton, and Miss
Marianne must try to comfort him."
 
Mr. Dashwoods strains were more solemn.  Mrs. Ferrars was the most
unfortunate of womenpoor Fanny had suffered agonies of
sensibilityand he considered the existence of each, under such a
blow, with grateful wonder.  Roberts offence was unpardonable, but
Lucys was infinitely worse.  Neither of them were ever again to be
mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars and even, if she might hereafter be induced
to forgive her son, his wife should never be acknowledged as her
daughter, nor be permitted to appear in her presence.  The secrecy with
which everything had been carried on between them, was rationally
treated as enormously heightening the crime, because, had any suspicion
of it occurred to the others, proper measures would have been taken to
prevent the marriage and he called on Elinor to join with him in
regretting that Lucys engagement with Edward had not rather been
fulfilled, than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery
farther in the family. He thus continued
 
"Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edwards name, which does not
surprise us but, to our great astonishment, not a line has been
received from him on the occasion.  Perhaps, however, he is kept silent
by his fear of offending, and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a
line to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter of proper
submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her shewn to
her mother, might not be taken amiss for we all know the tenderness of
Mrs. Ferrarss heart, and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be
on good terms with her children."
 
This paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of
Edward.  It determined him to attempt a reconciliation, though not
exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.
 
"A letter of proper submission!" repeated he "would they have me beg
my mothers pardon for Roberts ingratitude to HER, and breach of
honour to ME?I can make no submissionI am grown neither humble nor
penitent by what has passed.I am grown very happy but that would not
interest.I know of no submission that IS proper for me to make."
 
"You may certainly ask to be forgiven," said Elinor, "because you have
offendedand I should think you might NOW venture so far as to
profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew
on you your mothers anger."
 
He agreed that he might.
 
"And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility may be
convenient while acknowledging a second engagement, almost as imprudent
in HER eyes as the first."
 
He had nothing to urge against it, but still resisted the idea of a
letter of proper submission and therefore, to make it easier to him,
as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by
word of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that, instead of writing
to Fanny, he should go to London, and personally intreat her good
offices in his favour. "And if they really DO interest themselves,"
said Marianne, in her new character of candour, "in bringing about a
reconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely
without merit."
 
After a visit on Colonel Brandons side of only three or four days, the
two gentlemen quitted Barton together. They were to go immediately to
Delaford, that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future
home, and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements
were needed to it and from thence, after staying there a couple of
nights, he was to proceed on his journey to town.
 
 
 
CHAPTER 50
 
 
After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars, just so violent
and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always
seemed fearful of incurring, the reproach of being too amiable, Edward
was admitted to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.
 
Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating.  For many years of
her life she had had two sons but the crime and annihilation of Edward
a few weeks ago, had robbed her of one the similar annihilation of
Robert had left her for a fortnight without any and now, by the
resuscitation of Edward, she had one again.
 
In spite of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did not
feel the continuance of his existence secure, till he had revealed his
present engagement for the publication of that circumstance, he
feared, might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry him off
as rapidly as before.  With apprehensive caution therefore it was
revealed, and he was listened to with unexpected calmness.  Mrs.
Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying
Miss Dashwood, by every argument in her powertold him, that in Miss
Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortuneand
enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter
of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was only
the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE but when
she found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her
representation, he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she
judged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submitand
therefore, after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own
dignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of goodwill, she
issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.
 
What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to
be considered and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was now
her only son, he was by no means her eldest for while Robert was
inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds ayear, not the smallest
objection was made against Edwards taking orders for the sake of two
hundred and fifty at the utmost nor was anything promised either for
the present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had
been given with Fanny.
 
It was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected, by
Edward and Elinor and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses,
seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.
 
With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them,
they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the
living, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with
an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making
considerable improvements and after waiting some time for their
completion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments
and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,
as usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying
till every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton
church early in the autumn.
 
The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the
Mansionhouse from whence they could superintend the progress of the
Parsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the spotcould
chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep.  Mrs. Jenningss
prophecies, though rather jumbled together, were chiefly fulfilled for
she was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by
Michaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her husband, as she really
believed, one of the happiest couples in the world.  They had in fact
nothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne,
and rather better pasturage for their cows.
 
They were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations
and friends.  Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was
almost ashamed of having authorised and even the Dashwoods were at the
expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.
 
"I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister," said John, as
they were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford
House, "THAT would be saying too much, for certainly you have been one
of the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is.  But, I
confess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon
brother.  His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in
such respectable and excellent condition!and his woods!I have not
seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in
Delaford Hanger!And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly
the person to attract himyet I think it would altogether be advisable
for you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel
Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may
happenfor, when people are much thrown together, and see little of
anybody elseand it will always be in your power to set her off to
advantage, and so forthin short, you may as well give her a
chanceYou understand me."
 
But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always treated them
with the makebelieve of decent affection, they were never insulted by
her real favour and preference.  THAT was due to the folly of Robert,
and the cunning of his wife and it was earned by them before many
months had passed away.  The selfish sagacity of the latter, which had
at first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the principal instrument of
his deliverance from it for her respectful humility, assiduous
attentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening was
given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice, and
reestablished him completely in her favour.
 
The whole of Lucys behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which
crowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instance
of what an earnest, an unceasing attention to selfinterest, however
its progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every
advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time and
conscience.  When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and privately
visited her in Bartletts Buildings, it was only with the view imputed
to him by his brother.  He merely meant to persuade her to give up the
engagement and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection
of both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle
the matter.  In that point, however, and that only, he erredfor
though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her
in TIME, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to
produce this conviction.  Some doubts always lingered in her mind when
they parted, which could only be removed by another half hours
discourse with himself.  His attendance was by this means secured, and
the rest followed in course.  Instead of talking of Edward, they came
gradually to talk only of Robert,a subject on which he had always
more to say than on any other, and in which she soon betrayed an
interest even equal to his own and in short, it became speedily
evident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother.  He was
proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of
marrying privately without his mothers consent.  What immediately
followed is known.  They passed some months in great happiness at
Dawlish for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cutand
he drew several plans for magnificent cottagesand from thence
returning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by the
simple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucys instigation, was
adopted.  The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable,
comprehended only Robert and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and
therefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks
longer unpardoned.  But perseverance in humility of conduct and
messages, in selfcondemnation for Roberts offence, and gratitude for
the unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughty
notice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards,
by rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.
Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert or Fanny
and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended
to marry her, and Elinor, though superior to her in fortune and birth,
was spoken of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered, and
always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child.  They settled in
town, received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the
best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods and setting aside the
jealousies and illwill continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy,
in which their husbands of course took a part, as well as the frequent
domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing
could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together.
 
What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have
puzzled many people to find out and what Robert had done to succeed to
it, might have puzzled them still more.  It was an arrangement,
however, justified in its effects, if not in its cause for nothing
ever appeared in Roberts style of living or of talking to give a
suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income, as either leaving
his brother too little, or bringing himself too muchand if Edward
might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every
particular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home, and
from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed no
less contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an
exchange.
 
Elinors marriage divided her as little from her family as could well
be contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless,
for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with
her.  Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure
in the frequency of her visits at Delaford for her wish of bringing
Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest, though
rather more liberal than what John had expressed.  It was now her
darling object.  Precious as was the company of her daughter to her,
she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her
valued friend and to see Marianne settled at the mansionhouse was
equally the wish of Edward and Elinor.  They each felt his sorrows, and
their own obligations, and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the
reward of all.
 
With such a confederacy against herwith a knowledge so intimate of
his goodnesswith a conviction of his fond attachment to herself,
which at last, though long after it was observable to everybody
elseburst on herwhat could she do?
 
Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate.  She was born to
discover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her
conduct, her most favourite maxims.  She was born to overcome an
affection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment
superior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give
her hand to another!and THAT other, a man who had suffered no less
than herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two years
before, she had considered too old to be married,and who still sought
the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!
 
But so it was.  Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible
passion, as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting,instead
of remaining even for ever with her mother, and finding her only
pleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her more calm and
sober judgment she had determined on,she found herself at nineteen,
submitting to new attachments, entering on new duties, placed in a new
home, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village.
 
Colonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him,
believed he deserved to bein Marianne he was consoled for every past
afflictionher regard and her society restored his mind to animation,
and his spirits to cheerfulness and that Marianne found her own
happiness in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight of
each observing friend.  Marianne could never love by halves and her
whole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband, as it had
once been to Willoughby.
 
Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang and his
punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of
Mrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character, as
the source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he
behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been happy
and rich.  That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought its
own punishment, was sincere, need not be doubtednor that he long
thought of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret.  But
that he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society, or
contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must
not be depended onfor he did neither.  He lived to exert, and
frequently to enjoy himself.  His wife was not always out of humour,
nor his home always uncomfortable and in his breed of horses and dogs,
and in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable degree of
domestic felicity.
 
For Marianne, howeverin spite of his incivility in surviving her
losshe always retained that decided regard which interested him in
every thing that befell her, and made her his secret standard of
perfection in womanand many a rising beauty would be slighted by him
in afterdays as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.
 
Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without
attempting a removal to Delaford and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs.
Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret had reached an
age highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible for being
supposed to have a lover.
 
Between Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication
which strong family affection would naturally dictateand among the
merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked
as the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost
within sight of each other, they could live without disagreement
between themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.
 
 
 
THE END
 
The Raven
 
 
by
 
Edgar Allan Poe
 
 
 
 
 
  Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
  Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
  While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
  As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
  "Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door
                                     Only this and nothing more."
 
  Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
  And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
  Eagerly I wished the morrowvainly I had sought to borrow
  From my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost Lenore
  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore
                                     Nameless here for evermore.
 
  And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
  Thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
  So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
  "Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door
  Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door
                                     This it is and nothing more."
 
  Presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer,
  "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore
  But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
  And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
  That I scarce was sure I heard you"here I opened wide the door
                                     Darkness there and nothing more.
 
  Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before
  But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
  And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?"
  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"
                                     Merely this and nothing more.
 
  Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
  Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.
  "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice
  Let me see, then, what thereat is and this mystery explore
  Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore
                                     Tis the wind and nothing more.
 
  Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
  In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.
  Not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he,
  But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door
  Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door
                                     Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
 
  Then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
  "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,
  Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore
  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Nights Plutonian shore!"
                                     Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
 
  Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
  Though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore
  For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
  Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door
  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
                                     With such name as "Nevermore."
 
  But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
  That one word, as if its soul in that one word he did outpour
  Nothing farther then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered
  Till I scarcely more than muttered "Other friends have flown before
  On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before."
                                     Then the bird said "Nevermore."
 
  Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
  "Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,
  Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
  Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore
  Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
                                     Of Nevernevermore."
 
  But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
  Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door
  Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
  Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore
  What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
                                     Meant in croaking "Nevermore."
 
  This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
  To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core
  This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
  On the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer,
  But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer
                                     _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!
 
  Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
  Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.
  "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent theeby these angels he hath sent thee
  Respiterespite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
  Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"
                                     Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
 
  "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!prophet still, if bird or devil!
  Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
  Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted
  On this home by Horror hauntedtell me truly, I implore
  Is there_is_ there balm in Gilead?tell metell me, I implore!"
                                     Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
 
  "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!prophet still, if bird or devil!
  By that Heaven that bends above usby that God we both adore
  Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
  It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore
  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."
                                     Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
 
  "Be that our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting
  "Get thee back into the tempest and the Nights Plutonian shore!
  Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken!
  Leave my loneliness unbroken!quit the bust above my door!
  Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
                                     Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
 
  And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door
  And his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming
  And the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadows on the floor
  And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
                                     Shall be liftednevermore!
 
 
 
In Which the Reader Is Introduced to a Man of Humanity
 
 
Late in the afternoon of a chilly day in February, two gentlemen were
sitting alone over their wine, in a wellfurnished dining parlor, in
the town of P, in Kentucky. There were no servants present, and the
gentlemen, with chairs closely approaching, seemed to be discussing some
subject with great earnestness.
 
For convenience sake, we have said, hitherto, two _gentlemen_. One of
the parties, however, when critically examined, did not seem, strictly
speaking, to come under the species. He was a short, thickset man,
with coarse, commonplace features, and that swaggering air of pretension
which marks a low man who is trying to elbow his way upward in the
world. He was much overdressed, in a gaudy vest of many colors, a blue
neckerchief, bedropped gayly with yellow spots, and arranged with a
flaunting tie, quite in keeping with the general air of the man. His
hands, large and coarse, were plentifully bedecked with rings and he
wore a heavy gold watchchain, with a bundle of seals of portentous
size, and a great variety of colors, attached to it,which, in the
ardor of conversation, he was in the habit of flourishing and jingling
with evident satisfaction. His conversation was in free and easy
defiance of Murrays Grammar, and was garnished at convenient intervals
with various profane expressions, which not even the desire to be
graphic in our account shall induce us to transcribe.
 
      English Grammar 1795, by Lindley Murray 17451826, the
     most authoritative American grammarian of his day.
 
His companion, Mr. Shelby, had the appearance of a gentleman and the
arrangements of the house, and the general air of the housekeeping,
indicated easy, and even opulent circumstances. As we before stated, the
two were in the midst of an earnest conversation.
 
"That is the way I should arrange the matter," said Mr. Shelby.
 
"I cant make trade that wayI positively cant, Mr. Shelby," said the
other, holding up a glass of wine between his eye and the light.
 
"Why, the fact is, Haley, Tom is an uncommon fellow he is certainly
worth that sum anywhere,steady, honest, capable, manages my whole farm
like a clock."
 
"You mean honest, as niggers go," said Haley, helping himself to a glass
of brandy.
 
"No I mean, really, Tom is a good, steady, sensible, pious fellow. He
got religion at a campmeeting, four years ago and I believe he
really _did_ get it. Ive trusted him, since then, with everything I
have,money, house, horses,and let him come and go round the country
and I always found him true and square in everything."
 
"Some folks dont believe there is pious niggers Shelby," said Haley,
with a candid flourish of his hand, "but _I do_. I had a fellow, now,
in this yer last lot I took to Orleanst was as good as a meetin, now,
really, to hear that critter pray and he was quite gentle and quiet
like. He fetched me a good sum, too, for I bought him cheap of a man
that was bliged to sell out so I realized six hundred on him. Yes, I
consider religion a valeyable thing in a nigger, when its the genuine
article, and no mistake."
 
"Well, Toms got the real article, if ever a fellow had," rejoined the
other. "Why, last fall, I let him go to Cincinnati alone, to do business
for me, and bring home five hundred dollars. Tom, says I to him,
I trust you, because I think youre a ChristianI know you wouldnt
cheat. Tom comes back, sure enough I knew he would. Some low fellows,
they say, said to himTom, why dont you make tracks for Canada? Ah,
master trusted me, and I couldnt,they told me about it. I am sorry
to part with Tom, I must say. You ought to let him cover the whole
balance of the debt and you would, Haley, if you had any conscience."
 
"Well, Ive got just as much conscience as any man in business can
afford to keep,just a little, you know, to swear by, as t were," said
the trader, jocularly "and, then, Im ready to do anything in reason
to blige friends but this yer, you see, is a leetle too hard on a
fellowa leetle too hard." The trader sighed contemplatively, and
poured out some more brandy.
 
"Well, then, Haley, how will you trade?" said Mr. Shelby, after an
uneasy interval of silence.
 
"Well, havent you a boy or gal that you could throw in with Tom?"
 
"Hum!none that I could well spare to tell the truth, its only hard
necessity makes me willing to sell at all. I dont like parting with any
of my hands, thats a fact."
 
Here the door opened, and a small quadroon boy, between four and five
years of age, entered the room. There was something in his appearance
remarkably beautiful and engaging. His black hair, fine as floss silk,
hung in glossy curls about his round, dimpled face, while a pair of
large dark eyes, full of fire and softness, looked out from beneath the
rich, long lashes, as he peered curiously into the apartment. A gay robe
of scarlet and yellow plaid, carefully made and neatly fitted, set off
to advantage the dark and rich style of his beauty and a certain comic
air of assurance, blended with bashfulness, showed that he had been not
unused to being petted and noticed by his master.
 
"Hulloa, Jim Crow!" said Mr. Shelby, whistling, and snapping a bunch of
raisins towards him, "pick that up, now!"
 
The child scampered, with all his little strength, after the prize,
while his master laughed.
 
"Come here, Jim Crow," said he. The child came up, and the master patted
the curly head, and chucked him under the chin.
 
"Now, Jim, show this gentleman how you can dance and sing." The boy
commenced one of those wild, grotesque songs common among the negroes,
in a rich, clear voice, accompanying his singing with many comic
evolutions of the hands, feet, and whole body, all in perfect time to
the music.
 
"Bravo!" said Haley, throwing him a quarter of an orange.
 
"Now, Jim, walk like old Uncle Cudjoe, when he has the rheumatism," said
his master.
 
Instantly the flexible limbs of the child assumed the appearance of
deformity and distortion, as, with his back humped up, and his masters
stick in his hand, he hobbled about the room, his childish face drawn
into a doleful pucker, and spitting from right to left, in imitation of
an old man.
 
Both gentlemen laughed uproariously.
 
"Now, Jim," said his master, "show us how old Elder Robbins leads the
psalm." The boy drew his chubby face down to a formidable length, and
commenced toning a psalm tune through his nose, with imperturbable
gravity.
 
"Hurrah! bravo! what a young un!" said Haley "that chaps a case,
Ill promise. Tell you what," said he, suddenly clapping his hand on Mr.
Shelbys shoulder, "fling in that chap, and Ill settle the businessI
will. Come, now, if that aint doing the thing up about the rightest!"
 
At this moment, the door was pushed gently open, and a young quadroon
woman, apparently about twentyfive, entered the room.
 
There needed only a glance from the child to her, to identify her as its
mother. There was the same rich, full, dark eye, with its long lashes
the same ripples of silky black hair. The brown of her complexion gave
way on the cheek to a perceptible flush, which deepened as she saw
the gaze of the strange man fixed upon her in bold and undisguised
admiration. Her dress was of the neatest possible fit, and set off to
advantage her finely moulded shapea delicately formed hand and a trim
foot and ankle were items of appearance that did not escape the quick
eye of the trader, well used to run up at a glance the points of a fine
female article.
 
"Well, Eliza?" said her master, as she stopped and looked hesitatingly
at him.
 
"I was looking for Harry, please, sir" and the boy bounded toward her,
showing his spoils, which he had gathered in the skirt of his robe.
 
"Well, take him away then," said Mr. Shelby and hastily she withdrew,
carrying the child on her arm.
 
"By Jupiter," said the trader, turning to him in admiration, "theres an
article, now! You might make your fortune on that ar gal in Orleans, any
day. Ive seen over a thousand, in my day, paid down for gals not a bit
handsomer."
 
"I dont want to make my fortune on her," said Mr. Shelby, dryly and,
seeking to turn the conversation, he uncorked a bottle of fresh wine,
and asked his companions opinion of it.
 
"Capital, sir,first chop!" said the trader then turning, and slapping
his hand familiarly on Shelbys shoulder, he added
 
"Come, how will you trade about the gal?what shall I say for
herwhatll you take?"
 
"Mr. Haley, she is not to be sold," said Shelby. "My wife would not part
with her for her weight in gold."
 
"Ay, ay! women always say such things, cause they hant no sort of
calculation. Just show em how many watches, feathers, and trinkets,
ones weight in gold would buy, and that alters the case, _I_ reckon."
 
"I tell you, Haley, this must not be spoken of I say no, and I mean
no," said Shelby, decidedly.
 
"Well, youll let me have the boy, though," said the trader "you must
own Ive come down pretty handsomely for him."
 
"What on earth can you want with the child?" said Shelby.
 
"Why, Ive got a friend thats going into this yer branch of the
businesswants to buy up handsome boys to raise for the market. Fancy
articles entirelysell for waiters, and so on, to rich uns, that
can pay for handsome uns. It sets off one of yer great placesa real
handsome boy to open door, wait, and tend. They fetch a good sum and
this little devil is such a comical, musical concern, hes just the
article!
 
"I would rather not sell him," said Mr. Shelby, thoughtfully "the fact
is, sir, Im a humane man, and I hate to take the boy from his mother,
sir."
 
"O, you do?La! yessomething of that ar natur. I understand,
perfectly. It is mighty onpleasant getting on with women, sometimes, I
alays hates these yer screechin, screamin times. They are _mighty_
onpleasant but, as I manages business, I generally avoids em, sir.
Now, what if you get the girl off for a day, or a week, or so then the
things done quietly,all over before she comes home. Your wife might
get her some earrings, or a new gown, or some such truck, to make up
with her."
 
"Im afraid not."
 
"Lor bless ye, yes! These critters aint like white folks, you know
they gets over things, only manage right. Now, they say," said Haley,
assuming a candid and confidential air, "that this kind o trade is
hardening to the feelings but I never found it so. Fact is, I never
could do things up the way some fellers manage the business. Ive seen
em as would pull a womans child out of her arms, and set him up
to sell, and she screechin like mad all the timevery bad
policydamages the articlemakes em quite unfit for service
sometimes. I knew a real handsome gal once, in Orleans, as was entirely
ruined by this sort o handling. The fellow that was trading for her
didnt want her baby and she was one of your real high sort, when her
blood was up. I tell you, she squeezed up her child in her arms, and
talked, and went on real awful. It kinder makes my blood run cold to
think of t and when they carried off the child, and locked her up,
she jest went ravin mad, and died in a week. Clear waste, sir, of a
thousand dollars, just for want of management,theres where t
is. Its always best to do the humane thing, sir thats been _my_
experience." And the trader leaned back in his chair, and folded his
arm, with an air of virtuous decision, apparently considering himself a
second Wilberforce.
 
The subject appeared to interest the gentleman deeply for while Mr.
Shelby was thoughtfully peeling an orange, Haley broke out afresh, with
becoming diffidence, but as if actually driven by the force of truth to
say a few words more.
 
"It dont look well, now, for a feller to be praisin himself but I say
it jest because its the truth. I believe Im reckoned to bring in about
the finest droves of niggers that is brought in,at least, Ive been
told so if I have once, I reckon I have a hundred times,all in good
case,fat and likely, and I lose as few as any man in the business. And
I lays it all to my management, sir and humanity, sir, I may say, is
the great pillar of _my_ management."
 
Mr. Shelby did not know what to say, and so he said, "Indeed!"
 
"Now, Ive been laughed at for my notions, sir, and Ive been talked to.
They ant poplar, and they ant common but I stuck to em, sir Ive
stuck to em, and realized well on em yes, sir, they have paid their
passage, I may say," and the trader laughed at his joke.
 
There was something so piquant and original in these elucidations of
humanity, that Mr. Shelby could not help laughing in company. Perhaps
you laugh too, dear reader but you know humanity comes out in a variety
of strange forms nowadays, and there is no end to the odd things that
humane people will say and do.
 
Mr. Shelbys laugh encouraged the trader to proceed.
 
"Its strange, now, but I never could beat this into peoples heads.
Now, there was Tom Loker, my old partner, down in Natchez he was a
clever fellow, Tom was, only the very devil with niggers,on principle
t was, you see, for a better hearted feller never broke bread t was
his _system_, sir. I used to talk to Tom. Why, Tom, I used to say,
when your gals takes on and cry, whats the use o crackin on em over
the head, and knockin on em round? Its ridiculous, says I, and
dont do no sort o good. Why, I dont see no harm in their cryin,
says I its natur, says I, and if natur cant blow off one way, it
will another. Besides, Tom, says I, it jest spiles your gals they get
sickly, and down in the mouth and sometimes they gets ugly,particular
yallow gals do,and its the devil and all gettin on em broke in.
Now, says I, why cant you kinder coax em up, and speak em fair?
Depend on it, Tom, a little humanity, thrown in along, goes a heap
further than all your jawin and crackin and it pays better, says I,
depend on t. But Tom couldnt get the hang on t and he spiled
so many for me, that I had to break off with him, though he was a
goodhearted fellow, and as fair a business hand as is goin."
 
"And do you find your ways of managing do the business better than
Toms?" said Mr. Shelby.
 
"Why, yes, sir, I may say so. You see, when I any ways can, I takes
a leetle care about the onpleasant parts, like selling young uns and
that,get the gals out of the wayout of sight, out of mind, you
know,and when its clean done, and cant be helped, they naturally
gets used to it. Tant, you know, as if it was white folks, thats
brought up in the way of spectin to keep their children and wives, and
all that. Niggers, you know, thats fetched up properly, hant no kind
of spectations of no kind so all these things comes easier."
 
"Im afraid mine are not properly brought up, then," said Mr. Shelby.
 
"Spose not you Kentucky folks spile your niggers. You mean well by
em, but tant no real kindness, arter all. Now, a nigger, you see,
whats got to be hacked and tumbled round the world, and sold to Tom,
and Dick, and the Lord knows who, tant no kindness to be givin on him
notions and expectations, and bringin on him up too well, for the rough
and tumble comes all the harder on him arter. Now, I venture to say,
your niggers would be quite chopfallen in a place where some of your
plantation niggers would be singing and whooping like all possessed.
Every man, you know, Mr. Shelby, naturally thinks well of his own ways
and I think I treat niggers just about as well as its ever worth while
to treat em."
 
"Its a happy thing to be satisfied," said Mr. Shelby, with a slight
shrug, and some perceptible feelings of a disagreeable nature.
 
"Well," said Haley, after they had both silently picked their nuts for a
season, "what do you say?"
 
"Ill think the matter over, and talk with my wife," said Mr. Shelby.
"Meantime, Haley, if you want the matter carried on in the quiet way
you speak of, youd best not let your business in this neighborhood be
known. It will get out among my boys, and it will not be a particularly
quiet business getting away any of my fellows, if they know it, Ill
promise you."
 
"O! certainly, by all means, mum! of course. But Ill tell you. Im in
a devil of a hurry, and shall want to know, as soon as possible, what I
may depend on," said he, rising and putting on his overcoat.
 
"Well, call up this evening, between six and seven, and you shall have
my answer," said Mr. Shelby, and the trader bowed himself out of the
apartment.
 
"Id like to have been able to kick the fellow down the steps," said
he to himself, as he saw the door fairly closed, "with his impudent
assurance but he knows how much he has me at advantage. If anybody
had ever said to me that I should sell Tom down south to one of those
rascally traders, I should have said, Is thy servant a dog, that
he should do this thing? And now it must come, for aught I see. And
Elizas child, too! I know that I shall have some fuss with wife
about that and, for that matter, about Tom, too. So much for being in
debt,heigho! The fellow sees his advantage, and means to push it."
 
Perhaps the mildest form of the system of slavery is to be seen in the
State of Kentucky. The general prevalence of agricultural pursuits of a
quiet and gradual nature, not requiring those periodic seasons of
hurry and pressure that are called for in the business of more southern
districts, makes the task of the negro a more healthful and reasonable
one while the master, content with a more gradual style of acquisition,
has not those temptations to hardheartedness which always overcome frail
human nature when the prospect of sudden and rapid gain is weighed in
the balance, with no heavier counterpoise than the interests of the
helpless and unprotected.
 
Whoever visits some estates there, and witnesses the goodhumored
indulgence of some masters and mistresses, and the affectionate loyalty
of some slaves, might be tempted to dream the oftfabled poetic legend
of a patriarchal institution, and all that but over and above the scene
there broods a portentous shadowthe shadow of _law_. So long as the
law considers all these human beings, with beating hearts and living
affections, only as so many _things_ belonging to a master,so long
as the failure, or misfortune, or imprudence, or death of the kindest
owner, may cause them any day to exchange a life of kind protection
and indulgence for one of hopeless misery and toil,so long it is
impossible to make anything beautiful or desirable in the best regulated
administration of slavery.
 
Mr. Shelby was a fair average kind of man, goodnatured and kindly, and
disposed to easy indulgence of those around him, and there had never
been a lack of anything which might contribute to the physical comfort
of the negroes on his estate. He had, however, speculated largely and
quite loosely had involved himself deeply, and his notes to a large
amount had come into the hands of Haley and this small piece of
information is the key to the preceding conversation.
 
Now, it had so happened that, in approaching the door, Eliza had caught
enough of the conversation to know that a trader was making offers to
her master for somebody.
 
She would gladly have stopped at the door to listen, as she came out
but her mistress just then calling, she was obliged to hasten away.
 
Still she thought she heard the trader make an offer for her boycould
she be mistaken? Her heart swelled and throbbed, and she involuntarily
strained him so tight that the little fellow looked up into her face in
astonishment.
 
"Eliza, girl, what ails you today?" said her mistress, when Eliza had
upset the washpitcher, knocked down the workstand, and finally was
abstractedly offering her mistress a long nightgown in place of the silk
dress she had ordered her to bring from the wardrobe.
 
Eliza started. "O, missis!" she said, raising her eyes then, bursting
into tears, she sat down in a chair, and began sobbing.
 
"Why, Eliza child, what ails you?" said her mistress.
 
"O! missis, missis," said Eliza, "theres been a trader talking with
master in the parlor! I heard him."
 
"Well, silly child, suppose there has."
 
"O, missis, _do_ you suppose masr would sell my Harry?" And the poor
creature threw herself into a chair, and sobbed convulsively.
 
"Sell him! No, you foolish girl! You know your master never deals with
those southern traders, and never means to sell any of his servants, as
long as they behave well. Why, you silly child, who do you think would
want to buy your Harry? Do you think all the world are set on him as you
are, you goosie? Come, cheer up, and hook my dress. There now, put my
back hair up in that pretty braid you learnt the other day, and dont go
listening at doors any more."
 
"Well, but, missis, _you_ never would give your consenttoto"
 
"Nonsense, child! to be sure, I shouldnt. What do you talk so for? I
would as soon have one of my own children sold. But really, Eliza, you
are getting altogether too proud of that little fellow. A man cant put
his nose into the door, but you think he must be coming to buy him."
 
Reassured by her mistress confident tone, Eliza proceeded nimbly and
adroitly with her toilet, laughing at her own fears, as she proceeded.
 
Mrs. Shelby was a woman of high class, both intellectually and morally.
To that natural magnanimity and generosity of mind which one often marks
as characteristic of the women of Kentucky, she added high moral and
religious sensibility and principle, carried out with great energy and
ability into practical results. Her husband, who made no professions
to any particular religious character, nevertheless reverenced and
respected the consistency of hers, and stood, perhaps, a little in awe
of her opinion. Certain it was that he gave her unlimited scope in all
her benevolent efforts for the comfort, instruction, and improvement of
her servants, though he never took any decided part in them himself. In
fact, if not exactly a believer in the doctrine of the efficiency of the
extra good works of saints, he really seemed somehow or other to fancy
that his wife had piety and benevolence enough for twoto indulge a
shadowy expectation of getting into heaven through her superabundance of
qualities to which he made no particular pretension.
 
The heaviest load on his mind, after his conversation with the trader,
lay in the foreseen necessity of breaking to his wife the arrangement
contemplated,meeting the importunities and opposition which he knew he
should have reason to encounter.
 
Mrs. Shelby, being entirely ignorant of her husbands embarrassments,
and knowing only the general kindliness of his temper, had been quite
sincere in the entire incredulity with which she had met Elizas
suspicions. In fact, she dismissed the matter from her mind, without a
second thought and being occupied in preparations for an evening visit,
it passed out of her thoughts entirely.
 
 
 
CHAPTER II
 
The Mother
 
 
Eliza had been brought up by her mistress, from girlhood, as a petted
and indulged favorite.
 
The traveller in the south must often have remarked that peculiar air of
refinement, that softness of voice and manner, which seems in many cases
to be a particular gift to the quadroon and mulatto women. These natural
graces in the quadroon are often united with beauty of the most dazzling
kind, and in almost every case with a personal appearance prepossessing
and agreeable. Eliza, such as we have described her, is not a fancy
sketch, but taken from remembrance, as we saw her, years ago, in
Kentucky. Safe under the protecting care of her mistress, Eliza had
reached maturity without those temptations which make beauty so fatal
an inheritance to a slave. She had been married to a bright and talented
young mulatto man, who was a slave on a neighboring estate, and bore the
name of George Harris.
 
This young man had been hired out by his master to work in a bagging
factory, where his adroitness and ingenuity caused him to be considered
the first hand in the place. He had invented a machine for the cleaning
of the hemp, which, considering the education and circumstances of
the inventor, displayed quite as much mechanical genius as Whitneys
cottongin.
 
       A machine of this description was really the invention of
     a young colored man in Kentucky. Mrs. Stowes note.
 
He was possessed of a handsome person and pleasing manners, and was a
general favorite in the factory. Nevertheless, as this young man was
in the eye of the law not a man, but a thing, all these superior
qualifications were subject to the control of a vulgar, narrowminded,
tyrannical master. This same gentleman, having heard of the fame of
Georges invention, took a ride over to the factory, to see what
this intelligent chattel had been about. He was received with great
enthusiasm by the employer, who congratulated him on possessing so
valuable a slave.
 
He was waited upon over the factory, shown the machinery by George, who,
in high spirits, talked so fluently, held himself so erect, looked
so handsome and manly, that his master began to feel an uneasy
consciousness of inferiority. What business had his slave to be marching
round the country, inventing machines, and holding up his head among
gentlemen? Hed soon put a stop to it. Hed take him back, and put
him to hoeing and digging, and "see if hed step about so smart."
Accordingly, the manufacturer and all hands concerned were astounded
when he suddenly demanded Georges wages, and announced his intention of
taking him home.
 
"But, Mr. Harris," remonstrated the manufacturer, "isnt this rather
sudden?"
 
"What if it is?isnt the man _mine_?"
 
"We would be willing, sir, to increase the rate of compensation."
 
"No object at all, sir. I dont need to hire any of my hands out, unless
Ive a mind to."
 
"But, sir, he seems peculiarly adapted to this business."
 
"Dare say he may be never was much adapted to anything that I set him
about, Ill be bound."
 
"But only think of his inventing this machine," interposed one of the
workmen, rather unluckily.
 
"O yes! a machine for saving work, is it? Hed invent that, Ill be
bound let a nigger alone for that, any time. They are all laborsaving
machines themselves, every one of em. No, he shall tramp!"
 
George had stood like one transfixed, at hearing his doom thus suddenly
pronounced by a power that he knew was irresistible. He folded his arms,
tightly pressed in his lips, but a whole volcano of bitter feelings
burned in his bosom, and sent streams of fire through his veins. He
breathed short, and his large dark eyes flashed like live coals and he
might have broken out into some dangerous ebullition, had not the kindly
manufacturer touched him on the arm, and said, in a low tone,
 
"Give way, George go with him for the present. Well try to help you,
yet."
 
The tyrant observed the whisper, and conjectured its import, though he
could not hear what was said and he inwardly strengthened himself in
his determination to keep the power he possessed over his victim.
 
George was taken home, and put to the meanest drudgery of the farm. He
had been able to repress every disrespectful word but the flashing eye,
the gloomy and troubled brow, were part of a natural language that could
not be repressed,indubitable signs, which showed too plainly that the
man could not become a thing.
 
It was during the happy period of his employment in the factory that
George had seen and married his wife. During that period,being much
trusted and favored by his employer,he had free liberty to come and go
at discretion. The marriage was highly approved of by Mrs. Shelby, who,
with a little womanly complacency in matchmaking, felt pleased to unite
her handsome favorite with one of her own class who seemed in every way
suited to her and so they were married in her mistress great parlor,
and her mistress herself adorned the brides beautiful hair with
orangeblossoms, and threw over it the bridal veil, which certainly
could scarce have rested on a fairer head and there was no lack of
white gloves, and cake and wine,of admiring guests to praise the
brides beauty, and her mistress indulgence and liberality. For a
year or two Eliza saw her husband frequently, and there was nothing to
interrupt their happiness, except the loss of two infant children, to
whom she was passionately attached, and whom she mourned with a grief
so intense as to call for gentle remonstrance from her mistress, who
sought, with maternal anxiety, to direct her naturally passionate
feelings within the bounds of reason and religion.
 
After the birth of little Harry, however, she had gradually become
tranquillized and settled and every bleeding tie and throbbing nerve,
once more entwined with that little life, seemed to become sound and
healthful, and Eliza was a happy woman up to the time that her husband
was rudely torn from his kind employer, and brought under the iron sway
of his legal owner.
 
The manufacturer, true to his word, visited Mr. Harris a week or two
after George had been taken away, when, as he hoped, the heat of the
occasion had passed away, and tried every possible inducement to lead
him to restore him to his former employment.
 
"You neednt trouble yourself to talk any longer," said he, doggedly "I
know my own business, sir."
 
"I did not presume to interfere with it, sir. I only thought that you
might think it for your interest to let your man to us on the terms
proposed."
 
"O, I understand the matter well enough. I saw your winking and
whispering, the day I took him out of the factory but you dont come it
over me that way. Its a free country, sir the mans _mine_, and I do
what I please with him,thats it!"
 
And so fell Georges last hopenothing before him but a life of toil
and drudgery, rendered more bitter by every little smarting vexation and
indignity which tyrannical ingenuity could devise.
 
A very humane jurist once said, The worst use you can put a man to is
to hang him. No there is another use that a man can be put to that is
WORSE!
 
 
 
CHAPTER III
 
The Husband and Father
 
 
Mrs. Shelby had gone on her visit, and Eliza stood in the verandah,
rather dejectedly looking after the retreating carriage, when a hand was
laid on her shoulder. She turned, and a bright smile lighted up her fine
eyes.
 
"George, is it you? How you frightened me! Well I am so glad you s
come! Missis is gone to spend the afternoon so come into my little
room, and well have the time all to ourselves."
 
Saying this, she drew him into a neat little apartment opening on the
verandah, where she generally sat at her sewing, within call of her
mistress.
 
"How glad I am!why dont you smile?and look at Harryhow he grows."
The boy stood shyly regarding his father through his curls, holding
close to the skirts of his mothers dress. "Isnt he beautiful?" said
Eliza, lifting his long curls and kissing him.
 
"I wish hed never been born!" said George, bitterly. "I wish Id never
been born myself!"
 
Surprised and frightened, Eliza sat down, leaned her head on her
husbands shoulder, and burst into tears.
 
"There now, Eliza, its too bad for me to make you feel so, poor girl!"
said he, fondly "its too bad O, how I wish you never had seen meyou
might have been happy!"
 
"George! George! how can you talk so? What dreadful thing has happened,
or is going to happen? Im sure weve been very happy, till lately."
 
"So we have, dear," said George. Then drawing his child on his knee, he
gazed intently on his glorious dark eyes, and passed his hands through
his long curls.
 
"Just like you, Eliza and you are the handsomest woman I ever saw, and
the best one I ever wish to see but, oh, I wish Id never seen you, nor
you me!"
 
"O, George, how can you!"
 
"Yes, Eliza, its all misery, misery, misery! My life is bitter as
wormwood the very life is burning out of me. Im a poor, miserable,
forlorn drudge I shall only drag you down with me, thats all. Whats
the use of our trying to do anything, trying to know anything, trying to
be anything? Whats the use of living? I wish I was dead!"
 
"O, now, dear George, that is really wicked! I know how you feel about
losing your place in the factory, and you have a hard master but pray
be patient, and perhaps something"
 
"Patient!" said he, interrupting her "havent I been patient? Did I say
a word when he came and took me away, for no earthly reason, from the
place where everybody was kind to me? Id paid him truly every cent of
my earnings,and they all say I worked well."
 
"Well, it _is_ dreadful," said Eliza "but, after all, he is your
master, you know."
 
"My master! and who made him my master? Thats what I think ofwhat
right has he to me? Im a man as much as he is. Im a better man than he
is. I know more about business than he does I am a better manager than
he is I can read better than he can I can write a better hand,and
Ive learned it all myself, and no thanks to him,Ive learned it in
spite of him and now what right has he to make a drayhorse of me?to
take me from things I can do, and do better than he can, and put me to
work that any horse can do? He tries to do it he says hell bring me
down and humble me, and he puts me to just the hardest, meanest and
dirtiest work, on purpose!"
 
"O, George! George! you frighten me! Why, I never heard you talk so Im
afraid youll do something dreadful. I dont wonder at your feelings, at
all but oh, do be carefuldo, dofor my sakefor Harrys!"
 
"I have been careful, and I have been patient, but its growing worse
and worse flesh and blood cant bear it any longerevery chance he
can get to insult and torment me, he takes. I thought I could do my work
well, and keep on quiet, and have some time to read and learn out of
work hours but the more he see I can do, the more he loads on. He says
that though I dont say anything, he sees Ive got the devil in me, and
he means to bring it out and one of these days it will come out in a
way that he wont like, or Im mistaken!"
 
"O dear! what shall we do?" said Eliza, mournfully.
 
"It was only yesterday," said George, "as I was busy loading stones into
a cart, that young Masr Tom stood there, slashing his whip so near the
horse that the creature was frightened. I asked him to stop, as pleasant
as I could,he just kept right on. I begged him again, and then he
turned on me, and began striking me. I held his hand, and then he
screamed and kicked and ran to his father, and told him that I was
fighting him. He came in a rage, and said hed teach me who was my
master and he tied me to a tree, and cut switches for young master, and
told him that he might whip me till he was tiredand he did do it! If
I dont make him remember it, some time!" and the brow of the young man
grew dark, and his eyes burned with an expression that made his young
wife tremble. "Who made this man my master? Thats what I want to know!"
he said.
 
"Well," said Eliza, mournfully, "I always thought that I must obey my
master and mistress, or I couldnt be a Christian."
 
"There is some sense in it, in your case they have brought you up like
a child, fed you, clothed you, indulged you, and taught you, so that you
have a good education that is some reason why they should claim you.
But I have been kicked and cuffed and sworn at, and at the best only let
alone and what do I owe? Ive paid for all my keeping a hundred times
over. I _wont_ bear it. No, I _wont_!" he said, clenching his hand
with a fierce frown.
 
Eliza trembled, and was silent. She had never seen her husband in this
mood before and her gentle system of ethics seemed to bend like a reed
in the surges of such passions.
 
"You know poor little Carlo, that you gave me," added George "the
creature has been about all the comfort that Ive had. He has slept with
me nights, and followed me around days, and kind o looked at me as if
he understood how I felt. Well, the other day I was just feeding him
with a few old scraps I picked up by the kitchen door, and Masr
came along, and said I was feeding him up at his expense, and that he
couldnt afford to have every nigger keeping his dog, and ordered me to
tie a stone to his neck and throw him in the pond."
 
"O, George, you didnt do it!"
 
"Do it? not I!but he did. Masr and Tom pelted the poor drowning
creature with stones. Poor thing! he looked at me so mournful, as if
he wondered why I didnt save him. I had to take a flogging because I
wouldnt do it myself. I dont care. Masr will find out that Im one
that whipping wont tame. My day will come yet, if he dont look out."
 
"What are you going to do? O, George, dont do anything wicked if you
only trust in God, and try to do right, hell deliver you."
 
"I ant a Christian like you, Eliza my hearts full of bitterness I
cant trust in God. Why does he let things be so?"
 
"O, George, we must have faith. Mistress says that when all things go
wrong to us, we must believe that God is doing the very best."
 
"Thats easy to say for people that are sitting on their sofas and
riding in their carriages but let em be where I am, I guess it would
come some harder. I wish I could be good but my heart burns, and cant
be reconciled, anyhow. You couldnt in my place,you cant now, if I
tell you all Ive got to say. You dont know the whole yet."
 
"What can be coming now?"
 
"Well, lately Masr has been saying that he was a fool to let me marry
off the place that he hates Mr. Shelby and all his tribe, because they
are proud, and hold their heads up above him, and that Ive got proud
notions from you and he says he wont let me come here any more, and
that I shall take a wife and settle down on his place. At first he
only scolded and grumbled these things but yesterday he told me that I
should take Mina for a wife, and settle down in a cabin with her, or he
would sell me down river."
 
"Whybut you were married to _me_, by the minister, as much as if youd
been a white man!" said Eliza, simply.
 
"Dont you know a slave cant be married? There is no law in this
country for that I cant hold you for my wife, if he chooses to part
us. Thats why I wish Id never seen you,why I wish Id never been
born it would have been better for us both,it would have been better
for this poor child if he had never been born. All this may happen to
him yet!"
 
"O, but master is so kind!"
 
"Yes, but who knows?he may dieand then he may be sold to nobody
knows who. What pleasure is it that he is handsome, and smart, and
bright? I tell you, Eliza, that a sword will pierce through your soul
for every good and pleasant thing your child is or has it will make him
worth too much for you to keep."
 
The words smote heavily on Elizas heart the vision of the trader came
before her eyes, and, as if some one had struck her a deadly blow,
she turned pale and gasped for breath. She looked nervously out on the
verandah, where the boy, tired of the grave conversation, had retired,
and where he was riding triumphantly up and down on Mr. Shelbys
walkingstick. She would have spoken to tell her husband her fears, but
checked herself.
 
"No, no,he has enough to bear, poor fellow!" she thought. "No, I wont
tell him besides, it ant true Missis never deceives us."
 
"So, Eliza, my girl," said the husband, mournfully, "bear up, now and
goodby, for Im going."
 
"Going, George! Going where?"
 
"To Canada," said he, straightening himself up "and when Im there, Ill
buy you thats all the hope thats left us. You have a kind master,
that wont refuse to sell you. Ill buy you and the boyGod helping
me, I will!"
 
"O, dreadful! if you should be taken?"
 
"I wont be taken, Eliza Ill _die_ first! Ill be free, or Ill die!"
 
"You wont kill yourself!"
 
"No need of that. They will kill me, fast enough they never will get me
down the river alive!"
 
"O, George, for my sake, do be careful! Dont do anything wicked dont
lay hands on yourself, or anybody else! You are tempted too muchtoo
much but dontgo you mustbut go carefully, prudently pray God to
help you."
 
"Well, then, Eliza, hear my plan. Masr took it into his head to send
me right by here, with a note to Mr. Symmes, that lives a mile past. I
believe he expected I should come here to tell you what I have. It would
please him, if he thought it would aggravate Shelbys folks, as he
calls em. Im going home quite resigned, you understand, as if all was
over. Ive got some preparations made,and there are those that will
help me and, in the course of a week or so, I shall be among the
missing, some day. Pray for me, Eliza perhaps the good Lord will hear
_you_."
 
"O, pray yourself, George, and go trusting in him then you wont do
anything wicked."
 
"Well, now, _goodby_," said George, holding Elizas hands, and gazing
into her eyes, without moving. They stood silent then there were last
words, and sobs, and bitter weeping,such parting as those may make
whose hope to meet again is as the spiders web,and the husband and
wife were parted.
 
 
 
CHAPTER IV
 
An Evening in Uncle Toms Cabin
 
 
The cabin of Uncle Tom was a small log building, close adjoining to "the
house," as the negro _par excellence_ designates his masters dwelling.
In front it had a neat gardenpatch, where, every summer, strawberries,
raspberries, and a variety of fruits and vegetables, flourished under
careful tending. The whole front of it was covered by a large
scarlet bignonia and a native multiflora rose, which, entwisting and
interlacing, left scarce a vestige of the rough logs to be seen. Here,
also, in summer, various brilliant annuals, such as marigolds, petunias,
fouroclocks, found an indulgent corner in which to unfold their
splendors, and were the delight and pride of Aunt Chloes heart.
 
Let us enter the dwelling. The evening meal at the house is over, and
Aunt Chloe, who presided over its preparation as head cook, has left
to inferior officers in the kitchen the business of clearing away and
washing dishes, and come out into her own snug territories, to "get her
ole mans supper" therefore, doubt not that it is her you see by the
fire, presiding with anxious interest over certain frizzling items in
a stewpan, and anon with grave consideration lifting the cover of
a bakekettle, from whence steam forth indubitable intimations of
"something good." A round, black, shining face is hers, so glossy as
to suggest the idea that she might have been washed over with white of
eggs, like one of her own tea rusks. Her whole plump countenance beams
with satisfaction and contentment from under her wellstarched checked
turban, bearing on it, however, if we must confess it, a little of
that tinge of selfconsciousness which becomes the first cook of the
neighborhood, as Aunt Chloe was universally held and acknowledged to be.
 
A cook she certainly was, in the very bone and centre of her soul. Not
a chicken or turkey or duck in the barnyard but looked grave when they
saw her approaching, and seemed evidently to be reflecting on their
latter end and certain it was that she was always meditating on
trussing, stuffing and roasting, to a degree that was calculated to
inspire terror in any reflecting fowl living. Her corncake, in all its
varieties of hoecake, dodgers, muffins, and other species too numerous
to mention, was a sublime mystery to all less practised compounders and
she would shake her fat sides with honest pride and merriment, as she
would narrate the fruitless efforts that one and another of her compeers
had made to attain to her elevation.
 
The arrival of company at the house, the arranging of dinners and
suppers "in style," awoke all the energies of her soul and no sight
was more welcome to her than a pile of travelling trunks launched on the
verandah, for then she foresaw fresh efforts and fresh triumphs.
 
Just at present, however, Aunt Chloe is looking into the bakepan in
which congenial operation we shall leave her till we finish our picture
of the cottage.
 
In one corner of it stood a bed, covered neatly with a snowy spread and
by the side of it was a piece of carpeting, of some considerable size.
On this piece of carpeting Aunt Chloe took her stand, as being decidedly
in the upper walks of life and it and the bed by which it lay, and the
whole corner, in fact, were treated with distinguished consideration,
and made, so far as possible, sacred from the marauding inroads
and desecrations of little folks. In fact, that corner was the
_drawingroom_ of the establishment. In the other corner was a bed of
much humbler pretensions, and evidently designed for _use_. The wall
over the fireplace was adorned with some very brilliant scriptural
prints, and a portrait of General Washington, drawn and colored in
a manner which would certainly have astonished that hero, if ever he
happened to meet with its like.
 
On a rough bench in the corner, a couple of woollyheaded boys,
with glistening black eyes and fat shining cheeks, were busy in
superintending the first walking operations of the baby, which, as
is usually the case, consisted in getting up on its feet, balancing a
moment, and then tumbling down,each successive failure being violently
cheered, as something decidedly clever.
 
A table, somewhat rheumatic in its limbs, was drawn out in front of
the fire, and covered with a cloth, displaying cups and saucers of a
decidedly brilliant pattern, with other symptoms of an approaching meal.
At this table was seated Uncle Tom, Mr. Shelbys best hand, who, as he
is to be the hero of our story, we must daguerreotype for our readers.
He was a large, broadchested, powerfullymade man, of a full glossy
black, and a face whose truly African features were characterized by an
expression of grave and steady good sense, united with much kindliness
and benevolence. There was something about his whole air selfrespecting
and dignified, yet united with a confiding and humble simplicity.
 
He was very busily intent at this moment on a slate lying before him,
on which he was carefully and slowly endeavoring to accomplish a copy
of some letters, in which operation he was overlooked by young Masr
George, a smart, bright boy of thirteen, who appeared fully to realize
the dignity of his position as instructor.
 
"Not that way, Uncle Tom,not that way," said he, briskly, as Uncle
Tom laboriously brought up the tail of his _g_ the wrong side out "that
makes a _q_, you see."
 
"La sakes, now, does it?" said Uncle Tom, looking with a respectful,
admiring air, as his young teacher flourishingly scrawled _q_s and
_g_s innumerable for his edification and then, taking the pencil in
his big, heavy fingers, he patiently recommenced.
 
"How easy white folks alus does things!" said Aunt Chloe, pausing
while she was greasing a griddle with a scrap of bacon on her fork, and
regarding young Master George with pride. "The way he can write, now!
and read, too! and then to come out here evenings and read his lessons
to us,its mighty interestin!"
 
"But, Aunt Chloe, Im getting mighty hungry," said George. "Isnt that
cake in the skillet almost done?"
 
"Mose done, Masr George," said Aunt Chloe, lifting the lid and peeping
in,"browning beautifula real lovely brown. Ah! let me alone for dat.
Missis let Sally try to make some cake, t other day, jes to _larn_ her,
she said. O, go way, Missis, said I it really hurts my feelins,
now, to see good vittles spilt dat ar way! Cake ris all to one sideno
shape at all no more than my shoe go way!"
 
And with this final expression of contempt for Sallys greenness, Aunt
Chloe whipped the cover off the bakekettle, and disclosed to view a
neatlybaked poundcake, of which no city confectioner need to have been
ashamed. This being evidently the central point of the entertainment,
Aunt Chloe began now to bustle about earnestly in the supper department.
 
"Here you, Mose and Pete! get out de way, you niggers! Get away,
Polly, honey,mammyll give her baby some fin, by and by. Now, Masr
George, you jest take off dem books, and set down now with my old man,
and Ill take up de sausages, and have de first griddle full of cakes on
your plates in less dan no time."
 
"They wanted me to come to supper in the house," said George "but I
knew what was what too well for that, Aunt Chloe."
 
"So you didso you did, honey," said Aunt Chloe, heaping the smoking
battercakes on his plate "you knowd your old auntyd keep the best
for you. O, let you alone for dat! Go way!" And, with that, aunty gave
George a nudge with her finger, designed to be immensely facetious, and
turned again to her griddle with great briskness.
 
"Now for the cake," said Masr George, when the activity of the
griddle department had somewhat subsided and, with that, the youngster
flourished a large knife over the article in question.
 
"La bless you, Masr George!" said Aunt Chloe, with earnestness,
catching his arm, "you wouldnt be for cuttin it wid dat ar great heavy
knife! Smash all downspile all de pretty rise of it. Here, Ive got a
thin old knife, I keeps sharp a purpose. Dar now, see! comes apart light
as a feather! Now eat awayyou wont get anything to beat dat ar."
 
"Tom Lincon says," said George, speaking with his mouth full, "that
their Jinny is a better cook than you."
 
"Dem Lincons ant much count, no way!" said Aunt Chloe, contemptuously
"I mean, set along side _our_ folks. They s spectable folks enough in
a kinder plain way but, as to gettin up anything in style, they dont
begin to have a notion on t. Set Masr Lincon, now, alongside Masr
Shelby! Good Lor! and Missis Lincon,can she kinder sweep it into a
room like my missis,so kinder splendid, yer know! O, go way! dont
tell me nothin of dem Lincons!"and Aunt Chloe tossed her head as one
who hoped she did know something of the world.
 
"Well, though, Ive heard you say," said George, "that Jinny was a
pretty fair cook."
 
"So I did," said Aunt Chloe,"I may say dat. Good, plain, common
cookin, Jinnyll domake a good pone o bread,bile her taters
_far_,her corn cakes isnt extra, not extra now, Jinnys corn cakes
isnt, but then theys far,but, Lor, come to de higher branches, and
what _can_ she do? Why, she makes piessartin she does but what kinder
crust? Can she make your real flecky paste, as melts in your mouth, and
lies all up like a puff? Now, I went over thar when Miss Mary was gwine
to be married, and Jinny she jest showed me de weddin pies. Jinny and
I is good friends, ye know. I never said nothin but go long, Masr
George! Why, I shouldnt sleep a wink for a week, if I had a batch of
pies like dem ar. Why, dey want no count t all."
 
"I suppose Jinny thought they were ever so nice," said George.
 
"Thought so!didnt she? Thar she was, showing em, as innocentye see,
its jest here, Jinny _dont know_. Lor, the family ant nothing! She
cant be spected to know! Tant no fault o hem. Ah, Masr George, you
doesnt know half your privileges in yer family and bringin up!" Here
Aunt Chloe sighed, and rolled up her eyes with emotion.
 
"Im sure, Aunt Chloe, I understand my pie and pudding privileges,"
said George. "Ask Tom Lincon if I dont crow over him, every time I meet
him."
 
Aunt Chloe sat back in her chair, and indulged in a hearty guffaw of
laughter, at this witticism of young Masrs, laughing till the tears
rolled down her black, shining cheeks, and varying the exercise with
playfully slapping and poking Masr Georgey, and telling him to go way,
and that he was a casethat he was fit to kill her, and that he sartin
would kill her, one of these days and, between each of these sanguinary
predictions, going off into a laugh, each longer and stronger than the
other, till George really began to think that he was a very dangerously
witty fellow, and that it became him to be careful how he talked "as
funny as he could."
 
"And so ye telled Tom, did ye? O, Lor! what young uns will be up ter!
Ye crowed over Tom? O, Lor! Masr George, if ye wouldnt make a hornbug
laugh!"
 
"Yes," said George, "I says to him, Tom, you ought to see some of Aunt
Chloes pies theyre the right sort, says I."
 
"Pity, now, Tom couldnt," said Aunt Chloe, on whose benevolent
heart the idea of Toms benighted condition seemed to make a strong
impression. "Ye oughter just ask him here to dinner, some o these
times, Masr George," she added "it would look quite pretty of ye.
Ye know, Masr George, ye oughtenter feel bove nobody, on count yer
privileges, cause all our privileges is gin to us we ought alays to
member that," said Aunt Chloe, looking quite serious.
 
"Well, I mean to ask Tom here, some day next week," said George "and
you do your prettiest, Aunt Chloe, and well make him stare. Wont we
make him eat so he wont get over it for a fortnight?"
 
"Yes, yessartin," said Aunt Chloe, delighted "youll see. Lor! to
think of some of our dinners! Yer mind dat ar great chicken pie I made
when we guv de dinner to General Knox? I and Missis, we come pretty near
quarrelling about dat ar crust. What does get into ladies sometimes,
I dont know but, sometimes, when a body has de heaviest kind o
sponsibility on em, as ye may say, and is all kinder _seris_
and taken up, dey takes dat ar time to be hangin round and kinder
interferin! Now, Missis, she wanted me to do dis way, and she wanted
me to do dat way and, finally, I got kinder sarcy, and, says I, Now,
Missis, do jist look at dem beautiful white hands o yourn with long
fingers, and all a sparkling with rings, like my white lilies when de
dew s on em and look at my great black stumpin hands. Now, dont ye
think dat de Lord must have meant _me_ to make de piecrust, and you to
stay in de parlor? Dar! I was jist so sarcy, Masr George."
 
"And what did mother say?" said George.
 
"Say?why, she kinder larfed in her eyesdem great handsome eyes o
hern and, says she, Well, Aunt Chloe, I think you are about in the
right on t, says she and she went off in de parlor. She oughter
cracked me over de head for bein so sarcy but dars whar t isI
cant do nothin with ladies in de kitchen!"
 
"Well, you made out well with that dinner,I remember everybody said
so," said George.
 
"Didnt I? And want I behind de dininroom door dat bery day? and
didnt I see de General pass his plate three times for some more dat
bery pie?and, says he, You must have an uncommon cook, Mrs. Shelby.
Lor! I was fit to split myself.
 
"And de Gineral, he knows what cookin is," said Aunt Chloe, drawing
herself up with an air. "Bery nice man, de Gineral! He comes of one of
de bery _fustest_ families in Old Virginny! He knows whats what, now,
as well as I dode Gineral. Ye see, theres _pints_ in all pies, Masr
George but tant everybody knows what they is, or as orter be. But the
Gineral, he knows I knew by his marks he made. Yes, he knows what de
pints is!"
 
By this time, Master George had arrived at that pass to which even a
boy can come under uncommon circumstances, when he really could not eat
another morsel, and, therefore, he was at leisure to notice the pile of
woolly heads and glistening eyes which were regarding their operations
hungrily from the opposite corner.
 
"Here, you Mose, Pete," he said, breaking off liberal bits, and throwing
it at them "you want some, dont you? Come, Aunt Chloe, bake them some
cakes."
 
And George and Tom moved to a comfortable seat in the chimneycorner,
while Aunte Chloe, after baking a goodly pile of cakes, took her baby
on her lap, and began alternately filling its mouth and her own, and
distributing to Mose and Pete, who seemed rather to prefer eating theirs
as they rolled about on the floor under the table, tickling each other,
and occasionally pulling the babys toes.
 
"O! go long, will ye?" said the mother, giving now and then a kick, in
a kind of general way, under the table, when the movement became too
obstreperous. "Cant ye be decent when white folks comes to see ye?
Stop dat ar, now, will ye? Better mind yerselves, or Ill take ye down a
buttonhole lower, when Masr George is gone!"
 
What meaning was couched under this terrible threat, it is difficult to
say but certain it is that its awful indistinctness seemed to produce
very little impression on the young sinners addressed.
 
"La, now!" said Uncle Tom, "they are so full of tickle all the while,
they cant behave theirselves."
 
Here the boys emerged from under the table, and, with hands and faces
well plastered with molasses, began a vigorous kissing of the baby.
 
"Get along wid ye!" said the mother, pushing away their woolly heads.
"Yell all stick together, and never get clar, if ye do dat fashion.
Go long to de spring and wash yerselves!" she said, seconding her
exhortations by a slap, which resounded very formidably, but which
seemed only to knock out so much more laugh from the young ones, as they
tumbled precipitately over each other out of doors, where they fairly
screamed with merriment.
 
"Did ye ever see such aggravating young uns?" said Aunt Chloe, rather
complacently, as, producing an old towel, kept for such emergencies,
she poured a little water out of the cracked teapot on it, and began
rubbing off the molasses from the babys face and hands and, having
polished her till she shone, she set her down in Toms lap, while she
busied herself in clearing away supper. The baby employed the intervals
in pulling Toms nose, scratching his face, and burying her fat hands
in his woolly hair, which last operation seemed to afford her special
content.
 
"Aint she a peart young un?" said Tom, holding her from him to take a
fulllength view then, getting up, he set her on his broad shoulder,
and began capering and dancing with her, while Masr George snapped at
her with his pockethandkerchief, and Mose and Pete, now returned again,
roared after her like bears, till Aunt Chloe declared that they "fairly
took her head off" with their noise. As, according to her own statement,
this surgical operation was a matter of daily occurrence in the cabin,
the declaration no whit abated the merriment, till every one had roared
and tumbled and danced themselves down to a state of composure.
 
"Well, now, I hopes youre done," said Aunt Chloe, who had been busy
in pulling out a rude box of a trundlebed "and now, you Mose and you
Pete, get into thar for wes goin to have the meetin."
 
"O mother, we dont wanter. We wants to sit up to meetin,meetins is
so curis. We likes em."
 
"La, Aunt Chloe, shove it under, and let em sit up," said Masr George,
decisively, giving a push to the rude machine.
 
Aunt Chloe, having thus saved appearances, seemed highly delighted to
push the thing under, saying, as she did so, "Well, mebbe t will do em
some good."
 
The house now resolved itself into a committee of the whole, to consider
the accommodations and arrangements for the meeting.
 
"What wes to do for cheers, now, _I_ declar I dont know," said Aunt
Chloe. As the meeting had been held at Uncle Toms weekly, for an
indefinite length of time, without any more "cheers," there seemed some
encouragement to hope that a way would be discovered at present.
 
"Old Uncle Peter sung both de legs out of dat oldest cheer, last week,"
suggested Mose.
 
"You go long! Ill boun you pulled em out some o your shines," said
Aunt Chloe.
 
"Well, itll stand, if it only keeps jam up agin de wall!" said Mose.
 
"Den Uncle Peter musnt sit in it, cause he alays hitches when he gets
a singing. He hitched pretty nigh across de room, t other night," said
Pete.
 
"Good Lor! get him in it, then," said Mose, "and den hed begin, Come
saintsand sinners, hear me tell, and den down hed go,"and Mose
imitated precisely the nasal tones of the old man, tumbling on the
floor, to illustrate the supposed catastrophe.
 
"Come now, be decent, cant ye?" said Aunt Chloe "ant yer shamed?"
 
Masr George, however, joined the offender in the laugh, and declared
decidedly that Mose was a "buster." So the maternal admonition seemed
rather to fail of effect.
 
"Well, ole man," said Aunt Chloe, "youll have to tote in them ar
barls."
 
"Mothers barls is like dat ar widders, Masr George was reading
bout, in de good book,dey never fails," said Mose, aside to Peter.
 
"Im sure one on em caved in last week," said Pete, "and let em all
down in de middle of de singin dat ar was failin, warnt it?"
 
During this aside between Mose and Pete, two empty casks had been rolled
into the cabin, and being secured from rolling, by stones on each side,
boards were laid across them, which arrangement, together with the
turning down of certain tubs and pails, and the disposing of the rickety
chairs, at last completed the preparation.
 
"Masr George is such a beautiful reader, now, I know hell stay to
read for us," said Aunt Chloe "pears like t will be so much more
interestin."
 
George very readily consented, for your boy is always ready for anything
that makes him of importance.
 
The room was soon filled with a motley assemblage, from the old
grayheaded patriarch of eighty, to the young girl and lad of fifteen. A
little harmless gossip ensued on various themes, such as where old Aunt
Sally got her new red headkerchief, and how "Missis was a going to give
Lizzy that spotted muslin gown, when shed got her new berage made up"
and how Masr Shelby was thinking of buying a new sorrel colt, that was
going to prove an addition to the glories of the place. A few of the
worshippers belonged to families hard by, who had got permission to
attend, and who brought in various choice scraps of information, about
the sayings and doings at the house and on the place, which circulated
as freely as the same sort of small change does in higher circles.
 
After a while the singing commenced, to the evident delight of all
present. Not even all the disadvantage of nasal intonation could prevent
the effect of the naturally fine voices, in airs at once wild and
spirited. The words were sometimes the wellknown and common hymns
sung in the churches about, and sometimes of a wilder, more indefinite
character, picked up at campmeetings.
 
The chorus of one of them, which ran as follows, was sung with great
energy and unction
 
     _"Die on the field of battle,
     Die on the field of battle,
     Glory in my soul."_
 
Another special favorite had oft repeated the words
 
     _"O, Im going to glory,wont you come along with me?
     Dont you see the angels beckning, and a calling me away?
     Dont you see the golden city and the everlasting day?"_
 
There were others, which made incessant mention of "Jordans banks,"
and "Canaans fields," and the "New Jerusalem" for the negro mind,
impassioned and imaginative, always attaches itself to hymns and
expressions of a vivid and pictorial nature and, as they sung,
some laughed, and some cried, and some clapped hands, or shook hands
rejoicingly with each other, as if they had fairly gained the other side
of the river.
 
Various exhortations, or relations of experience, followed, and
intermingled with the singing. One old grayheaded woman, long past
work, but much revered as a sort of chronicle of the past, rose, and
leaning on her staff, said"Well, chilen! Well, Im mighty glad to
hear ye all and see ye all once more, cause I dont know when Ill be
gone to glory but Ive done got ready, chilen pears like Id got
my little bundle all tied up, and my bonnet on, jest a waitin for the
stage to come along and take me home sometimes, in the night, I think
I hear the wheels a rattlin, and Im lookin out all the time now, you
jest be ready too, for I tell ye all, chilen," she said striking her
staff hard on the floor, "dat ar _glory_ is a mighty thing! Its a
mighty thing, chilen,you donno nothing about it,its _wonderful_."
And the old creature sat down, with streaming tears, as wholly overcome,
while the whole circle struck up
 
     _"O Canaan, bright Canaan
     Im bound for the land of Canaan."_
 
Masr George, by request, read the last chapters of Revelation, often
interrupted by such exclamations as "The _sakes_ now!" "Only hear that!"
"Jest think on t!" "Is all that a comin sure enough?"
 
George, who was a bright boy, and well trained in religious things by
his mother, finding himself an object of general admiration, threw
in expositions of his own, from time to time, with a commendable
seriousness and gravity, for which he was admired by the young and
blessed by the old and it was agreed, on all hands, that "a minister
couldnt lay it off better than he did that t was reely mazin!"
 
Uncle Tom was a sort of patriarch in religious matters, in the
neighborhood. Having, naturally, an organization in which the
_morale_ was strongly predominant, together with a greater breadth and
cultivation of mind than obtained among his companions, he was looked up
to with great respect, as a sort of minister among them and the simple,
hearty, sincere style of his exhortations might have edified even better
educated persons. But it was in prayer that he especially excelled.
Nothing could exceed the touching simplicity, the childlike earnestness,
of his prayer, enriched with the language of Scripture, which seemed so
entirely to have wrought itself into his being, as to have become a part
of himself, and to drop from his lips unconsciously in the language
of a pious old negro, he "prayed right up." And so much did his prayer
always work on the devotional feelings of his audiences, that there
seemed often a danger that it would be lost altogether in the abundance
of the responses which broke out everywhere around him.
 
 
While this scene was passing in the cabin of the man, one quite
otherwise passed in the halls of the master.
 
The trader and Mr. Shelby were seated together in the dining room
aforenamed, at a table covered with papers and writing utensils.
 
Mr. Shelby was busy in counting some bundles of bills, which, as they
were counted, he pushed over to the trader, who counted them likewise.
 
"All fair," said the trader "and now for signing these yer."
 
Mr. Shelby hastily drew the bills of sale towards him, and signed them,
like a man that hurries over some disagreeable business, and then pushed
them over with the money. Haley produced, from a wellworn valise,
a parchment, which, after looking over it a moment, he handed to Mr.
Shelby, who took it with a gesture of suppressed eagerness.
 
"Wal, now, the things _done_!" said the trader, getting up.
 
"Its _done_!" said Mr. Shelby, in a musing tone and, fetching a long
breath, he repeated, _"Its done!"_
 
"Yer dont seem to feel much pleased with it, pears to me," said the
trader.
 
"Haley," said Mr. Shelby, "I hope youll remember that you promised, on
your honor, you wouldnt sell Tom, without knowing what sort of hands
hes going into."
 
"Why, youve just done it sir," said the trader.
 
"Circumstances, you well know, _obliged_ me," said Shelby, haughtily.
 
"Wal, you know, they may blige _me_, too," said the trader.
"Howsomever, Ill do the very best I can in gettin Tom a good berth
as to my treatin on him bad, you neednt be a grain afeard. If theres
anything that I thank the Lord for, it is that Im never noways cruel."
 
After the expositions which the trader had previously given of his
humane principles, Mr. Shelby did not feel particularly reassured by
these declarations but, as they were the best comfort the case admitted
of, he allowed the trader to depart in silence, and betook himself to a
solitary cigar.
 
 
 
CHAPTER V
 
Showing the Feelings of Living Property on Changing Owners
 
 
Mr. and Mrs. Shelby had retired to their apartment for the night. He was
lounging in a large easychair, looking over some letters that had come
in the afternoon mail, and she was standing before her mirror, brushing
out the complicated braids and curls in which Eliza had arranged her
hair for, noticing her pale cheeks and haggard eyes, she had excused
her attendance that night, and ordered her to bed. The employment,
naturally enough, suggested her conversation with the girl in the
morning and turning to her husband, she said, carelessly,
 
"By the by, Arthur, who was that lowbred fellow that you lugged in to
our dinnertable today?"
 
"Haley is his name," said Shelby, turning himself rather uneasily in his
chair, and continuing with his eyes fixed on a letter.
 
"Haley! Who is he, and what may be his business here, pray?"
 
"Well, hes a man that I transacted some business with, last time I was
at Natchez," said Mr. Shelby.
 
"And he presumed on it to make himself quite at home, and call and dine
here, ay?"
 
"Why, I invited him I had some accounts with him," said Shelby.
 
"Is he a negrotrader?" said Mrs. Shelby, noticing a certain
embarrassment in her husbands manner.
 
"Why, my dear, what put that into your head?" said Shelby, looking up.
 
"Nothing,only Eliza came in here, after dinner, in a great worry,
crying and taking on, and said you were talking with a trader, and that
she heard him make an offer for her boythe ridiculous little goose!"
 
"She did, hey?" said Mr. Shelby, returning to his paper, which he seemed
for a few moments quite intent upon, not perceiving that he was holding
it bottom upwards.
 
"It will have to come out," said he, mentally "as well now as ever."
 
"I told Eliza," said Mrs. Shelby, as she continued brushing her hair,
"that she was a little fool for her pains, and that you never had
anything to do with that sort of persons. Of course, I knew you never
meant to sell any of our people,least of all, to such a fellow."
 
"Well, Emily," said her husband, "so I have always felt and said but
the fact is that my business lies so that I cannot get on without. I
shall have to sell some of my hands."
 
"To that creature? Impossible! Mr. Shelby, you cannot be serious."
 
"Im sorry to say that I am," said Mr. Shelby. "Ive agreed to sell
Tom."
 
"What! our Tom?that good, faithful creature!been your faithful
servant from a boy! O, Mr. Shelby!and you have promised him his
freedom, too,you and I have spoken to him a hundred times of it. Well,
I can believe anything now,I can believe _now_ that you could sell
little Harry, poor Elizas only child!" said Mrs. Shelby, in a tone
between grief and indignation.
 
"Well, since you must know all, it is so. I have agreed to sell Tom
and Harry both and I dont know why I am to be rated, as if I were a
monster, for doing what every one does every day."
 
"But why, of all others, choose these?" said Mrs. Shelby. "Why sell
them, of all on the place, if you must sell at all?"
 
"Because they will bring the highest sum of any,thats why. I could
choose another, if you say so. The fellow made me a high bid on Eliza,
if that would suit you any better," said Mr. Shelby.
 
"The wretch!" said Mrs. Shelby, vehemently.
 
"Well, I didnt listen to it, a moment,out of regard to your feelings,
I wouldntso give me some credit."
 
"My dear," said Mrs. Shelby, recollecting herself, "forgive me. I have
been hasty. I was surprised, and entirely unprepared for thisbut
surely you will allow me to intercede for these poor creatures. Tom is
a noblehearted, faithful fellow, if he is black. I do believe, Mr.
Shelby, that if he were put to it, he would lay down his life for you."
 
"I know it,I dare saybut whats the use of all this?I cant help
myself."
 
"Why not make a pecuniary sacrifice? Im willing to bear my part of the
inconvenience. O, Mr. Shelby, I have triedtried most faithfully, as a
Christian woman shouldto do my duty to these poor, simple, dependent
creatures. I have cared for them, instructed them, watched over them,
and know all their little cares and joys, for years and how can I ever
hold up my head again among them, if, for the sake of a little paltry
gain, we sell such a faithful, excellent, confiding creature as poor
Tom, and tear from him in a moment all we have taught him to love and
value? I have taught them the duties of the family, of parent and
child, and husband and wife and how can I bear to have this open
acknowledgment that we care for no tie, no duty, no relation, however
sacred, compared with money? I have talked with Eliza about her boyher
duty to him as a Christian mother, to watch over him, pray for him, and
bring him up in a Christian way and now what can I say, if you tear him
away, and sell him, soul and body, to a profane, unprincipled man, just
to save a little money? I have told her that one soul is worth more than
all the money in the world and how will she believe me when she sees
us turn round and sell her child?sell him, perhaps, to certain ruin of
body and soul!"
 
"Im sorry you feel so about it,indeed I am," said Mr. Shelby "and
I respect your feelings, too, though I dont pretend to share them to
their full extent but I tell you now, solemnly, its of no useI cant
help myself. I didnt mean to tell you this Emily but, in plain words,
there is no choice between selling these two and selling everything.
Either they must go, or _all_ must. Haley has come into possession of
a mortgage, which, if I dont clear off with him directly, will take
everything before it. Ive raked, and scraped, and borrowed, and all but
begged,and the price of these two was needed to make up the balance,
and I had to give them up. Haley fancied the child he agreed to settle
the matter that way, and no other. I was in his power, and _had_ to do
it. If you feel so to have them sold, would it be any better to have
_all_ sold?"
 
Mrs. Shelby stood like one stricken. Finally, turning to her toilet, she
rested her face in her hands, and gave a sort of groan.
 
"This is Gods curse on slavery!a bitter, bitter, most accursed
thing!a curse to the master and a curse to the slave! I was a fool to
think I could make anything good out of such a deadly evil. It is a sin
to hold a slave under laws like ours,I always felt it was,I always
thought so when I was a girl,I thought so still more after I joined
the church but I thought I could gild it over,I thought, by kindness,
and care, and instruction, I could make the condition of mine better
than freedomfool that I was!"
 
"Why, wife, you are getting to be an abolitionist, quite."
 
"Abolitionist! if they knew all I know about slavery, they _might_ talk!
We dont need them to tell us you know I never thought that slavery was
rightnever felt willing to own slaves."
 
"Well, therein you differ from many wise and pious men," said Mr.
Shelby. "You remember Mr. B.s sermon, the other Sunday?"
 
"I dont want to hear such sermons I never wish to hear Mr. B. in our
church again. Ministers cant help the evil, perhaps,cant cure it,
any more than we can,but defend it!it always went against my common
sense. And I think you didnt think much of that sermon, either."
 
"Well," said Shelby, "I must say these ministers sometimes carry matters
further than we poor sinners would exactly dare to do. We men of the
world must wink pretty hard at various things, and get used to a deal
that isnt the exact thing. But we dont quite fancy, when women and
ministers come out broad and square, and go beyond us in matters of
either modesty or morals, thats a fact. But now, my dear, I trust you
see the necessity of the thing, and you see that I have done the very
best that circumstances would allow."
 
"O yes, yes!" said Mrs. Shelby, hurriedly and abstractedly fingering
her gold watch,"I havent any jewelry of any amount," she added,
thoughtfully "but would not this watch do something?it was an
expensive one, when it was bought. If I could only at least save Elizas
child, I would sacrifice anything I have."
 
"Im sorry, very sorry, Emily," said Mr. Shelby, "Im sorry this takes
hold of you so but it will do no good. The fact is, Emily, the things
done the bills of sale are already signed, and in Haleys hands and
you must be thankful it is no worse. That man has had it in his power
to ruin us all,and now he is fairly off. If you knew the man as I do,
youd think that we had had a narrow escape."
 
"Is he so hard, then?"
 
"Why, not a cruel man, exactly, but a man of leather,a man alive to
nothing but trade and profit,cool, and unhesitating, and unrelenting,
as death and the grave. Hed sell his own mother at a good
percentagenot wishing the old woman any harm, either."
 
"And this wretch owns that good, faithful Tom, and Elizas child!"
 
"Well, my dear, the fact is that this goes rather hard with me its
a thing I hate to think of. Haley wants to drive matters, and take
possession tomorrow. Im going to get out my horse bright and early,
and be off. I cant see Tom, thats a fact and you had better arrange a
drive somewhere, and carry Eliza off. Let the thing be done when she is
out of sight."
 
"No, no," said Mrs. Shelby "Ill be in no sense accomplice or help in
this cruel business. Ill go and see poor old Tom, God help him, in his
distress! They shall see, at any rate, that their mistress can feel for
and with them. As to Eliza, I dare not think about it. The Lord forgive
us! What have we done, that this cruel necessity should come on us?"
 
There was one listener to this conversation whom Mr. and Mrs. Shelby
little suspected.
 
Communicating with their apartment was a large closet, opening by a door
into the outer passage. When Mrs. Shelby had dismissed Eliza for the
night, her feverish and excited mind had suggested the idea of this
closet and she had hidden herself there, and, with her ear pressed
close against the crack of the door, had lost not a word of the
conversation.
 
When the voices died into silence, she rose and crept stealthily away.
Pale, shivering, with rigid features and compressed lips, she looked
an entirely altered being from the soft and timid creature she had been
hitherto. She moved cautiously along the entry, paused one moment at her
mistress door, and raised her hands in mute appeal to Heaven, and then
turned and glided into her own room. It was a quiet, neat apartment,
on the same floor with her mistress. There was a pleasant sunny window,
where she had often sat singing at her sewing there a little case of
books, and various little fancy articles, ranged by them, the gifts of
Christmas holidays there was her simple wardrobe in the closet and in
the drawershere was, in short, her home and, on the whole, a happy
one it had been to her. But there, on the bed, lay her slumbering boy,
his long curls falling negligently around his unconscious face, his rosy
mouth half open, his little fat hands thrown out over the bedclothes,
and a smile spread like a sunbeam over his whole face.
 
"Poor boy! poor fellow!" said Eliza "they have sold you! but your
mother will save you yet!"
 
No tear dropped over that pillow in such straits as these, the heart
has no tears to give,it drops only blood, bleeding itself away in
silence. She took a piece of paper and a pencil, and wrote, hastily,
 
"O, Missis! dear Missis! dont think me ungrateful,dont think hard of
me, any way,I heard all you and master said tonight. I am going to try
to save my boyyou will not blame me! God bless and reward you for all
your kindness!"
 
Hastily folding and directing this, she went to a drawer and made up
a little package of clothing for her boy, which she tied with a
handkerchief firmly round her waist and, so fond is a mothers
remembrance, that, even in the terrors of that hour, she did not forget
to put in the little package one or two of his favorite toys, reserving
a gayly painted parrot to amuse him, when she should be called on to
awaken him. It was some trouble to arouse the little sleeper but, after
some effort, he sat up, and was playing with his bird, while his mother
was putting on her bonnet and shawl.
 
"Where are you going, mother?" said he, as she drew near the bed, with
his little coat and cap.
 
His mother drew near, and looked so earnestly into his eyes, that he at
once divined that something unusual was the matter.
 
"Hush, Harry," she said "mustnt speak loud, or they will hear us. A
wicked man was coming to take little Harry away from his mother, and
carry him way off in the dark but mother wont let himshes going to
put on her little boys cap and coat, and run off with him, so the ugly
man cant catch him."
 
Saying these words, she had tied and buttoned on the childs simple
outfit, and, taking him in her arms, she whispered to him to be
very still and, opening a door in her room which led into the outer
verandah, she glided noiselessly out.
 
It was a sparkling, frosty, starlight night, and the mother wrapped the
shawl close round her child, as, perfectly quiet with vague terror, he
clung round her neck.
 
Old Bruno, a great Newfoundland, who slept at the end of the porch,
rose, with a low growl, as she came near. She gently spoke his name,
and the animal, an old pet and playmate of hers, instantly, wagging his
tail, prepared to follow her, though apparently revolving much, in this
simple dogs head, what such an indiscreet midnight promenade might
mean. Some dim ideas of imprudence or impropriety in the measure seemed
to embarrass him considerably for he often stopped, as Eliza glided
forward, and looked wistfully, first at her and then at the house, and
then, as if reassured by reflection, he pattered along after her again.
A few minutes brought them to the window of Uncle Toms cottage, and
Eliza stopping, tapped lightly on the windowpane.
 
The prayermeeting at Uncle Toms had, in the order of hymnsinging,
been protracted to a very late hour and, as Uncle Tom had indulged
himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that,
although it was now between twelve and one oclock, he and his worthy
helpmeet were not yet asleep.
 
"Good Lord! whats that?" said Aunt Chloe, starting up and hastily
drawing the curtain. "My sakes alive, if it ant Lizy! Get on your
clothes, old man, quick!theres old Bruno, too, a pawin round what on
airth! Im gwine to open the door."
 
And suiting the action to the word, the door flew open, and the light
of the tallow candle, which Tom had hastily lighted, fell on the haggard
face and dark, wild eyes of the fugitive.
 
"Lord bless you!Im skeered to look at ye, Lizy! Are ye tuck sick, or
whats come over ye?"
 
"Im running awayUncle Tom and Aunt Chloecarrying off my
childMaster sold him!"
 
"Sold him?" echoed both, lifting up their hands in dismay.
 
"Yes, sold him!" said Eliza, firmly "I crept into the closet by
Mistress door tonight, and I heard Master tell Missis that he had sold
my Harry, and you, Uncle Tom, both, to a trader and that he was going
off this morning on his horse, and that the man was to take possession
today."
 
Tom had stood, during this speech, with his hands raised, and his eyes
dilated, like a man in a dream. Slowly and gradually, as its meaning
came over him, he collapsed, rather than seated himself, on his old
chair, and sunk his head down upon his knees.
 
"The good Lord have pity on us!" said Aunt Chloe. "O! it dont seem as
if it was true! What has he done, that Masr should sell _him_?"
 
"He hasnt done anything,it isnt for that. Master dont want to sell,
and Missis shes always good. I heard her plead and beg for us but he
told her t was no use that he was in this mans debt, and that this
man had got the power over him and that if he didnt pay him off clear,
it would end in his having to sell the place and all the people, and
move off. Yes, I heard him say there was no choice between selling these
two and selling all, the man was driving him so hard. Master said he was
sorry but oh, Missisyou ought to have heard her talk! If she ant a
Christian and an angel, there never was one. Im a wicked girl to leave
her so but, then, I cant help it. She said, herself, one soul was
worth more than the world and this boy has a soul, and if I let him be
carried off, who knows whatll become of it? It must be right but, if
it ant right, the Lord forgive me, for I cant help doing it!"
 
"Well, old man!" said Aunt Chloe, "why dont you go, too? Will you
wait to be toted down river, where they kill niggers with hard work and
starving? Id a heap rather die than go there, any day! Theres time for
ye,be off with Lizy,youve got a pass to come and go any time. Come,
bustle up, and Ill get your things together."
 
Tom slowly raised his head, and looked sorrowfully but quietly around,
and said,
 
"No, noI ant going. Let Eliza goits her right! I wouldnt be the
one to say notant in _natur_ for her to stay but you heard what she
said! If I must be sold, or all the people on the place, and everything
go to rack, why, let me be sold. I spose I can bar it as well as
any on em," he added, while something like a sob and a sigh shook his
broad, rough chest convulsively. "Masr always found me on the spothe
always will. I never have broke trust, nor used my pass no ways contrary
to my word, and I never will. Its better for me alone to go, than to
break up the place and sell all. Masr ant to blame, Chloe, and hell
take care of you and the poor"
 
Here he turned to the rough trundle bed full of little woolly heads, and
broke fairly down. He leaned over the back of the chair, and covered
his face with his large hands. Sobs, heavy, hoarse and loud, shook the
chair, and great tears fell through his fingers on the floor just such
tears, sir, as you dropped into the coffin where lay your firstborn
son such tears, woman, as you shed when you heard the cries of your
dying babe. For, sir, he was a man,and you are but another man. And,
woman, though dressed in silk and jewels, you are but a woman, and, in
lifes great straits and mighty griefs, ye feel but one sorrow!
 
"And now," said Eliza, as she stood in the door, "I saw my husband
only this afternoon, and I little knew then what was to come. They have
pushed him to the very last standing place, and he told me, today, that
he was going to run away. Do try, if you can, to get word to him. Tell
him how I went, and why I went and tell him Im going to try and find
Canada. You must give my love to him, and tell him, if I never see him
again," she turned away, and stood with her back to them for a moment,
and then added, in a husky voice, "tell him to be as good as he can, and
try and meet me in the kingdom of heaven."
 
"Call Bruno in there," she added. "Shut the door on him, poor beast! He
mustnt go with me!"
 
A few last words and tears, a few simple adieus and blessings, and
clasping her wondering and affrighted child in her arms, she glided
noiselessly away.
 
 
 
CHAPTER VI
 
Discovery
 
 
Mr. and Mrs. Shelby, after their protracted discussion of the night
before, did not readily sink to repose, and, in consequence, slept
somewhat later than usual, the ensuing morning.
 
"I wonder what keeps Eliza," said Mrs. Shelby, after giving her bell
repeated pulls, to no purpose.
 
Mr. Shelby was standing before his dressingglass, sharpening his razor
and just then the door opened, and a colored boy entered, with his
shavingwater.
 
"Andy," said his mistress, "step to Elizas door, and tell her I have
rung for her three times. Poor thing!" she added, to herself, with a
sigh.
 
Andy soon returned, with eyes very wide in astonishment.
 
"Lor, Missis! Lizys drawers is all open, and her things all lying every
which way and I believe shes just done clared out!"
 
The truth flashed upon Mr. Shelby and his wife at the same moment. He
exclaimed,
 
"Then she suspected it, and shes off!"
 
"The Lord be thanked!" said Mrs. Shelby. "I trust she is."
 
"Wife, you talk like a fool! Really, it will be something pretty awkward
for me, if she is. Haley saw that I hesitated about selling this child,
and hell think I connived at it, to get him out of the way. It touches
my honor!" And Mr. Shelby left the room hastily.
 
There was great running and ejaculating, and opening and shutting of
doors, and appearance of faces in all shades of color in different
places, for about a quarter of an hour. One person only, who might have
shed some light on the matter, was entirely silent, and that was the
head cook, Aunt Chloe. Silently, and with a heavy cloud settled down
over her once joyous face, she proceeded making out her breakfast
biscuits, as if she heard and saw nothing of the excitement around her.
 
Very soon, about a dozen young imps were roosting, like so many crows,
on the verandah railings, each one determined to be the first one to
apprize the strange Masr of his ill luck.
 
"Hell be rael mad, Ill be bound," said Andy.
 
"_Wont_ he swar!" said little black Jake.
 
"Yes, for he _does_ swar," said woollyheaded Mandy. "I hearn him
yesterday, at dinner. I hearn all about it then, cause I got into the
closet where Missis keeps the great jugs, and I hearn every word." And
Mandy, who had never in her life thought of the meaning of a word she
had heard, more than a black cat, now took airs of superior wisdom,
and strutted about, forgetting to state that, though actually coiled up
among the jugs at the time specified, she had been fast asleep all the
time.
 
When, at last, Haley appeared, booted and spurred, he was saluted with
the bad tidings on every hand. The young imps on the verandah were not
disappointed in their hope of hearing him "swar," which he did with a
fluency and fervency which delighted them all amazingly, as they
ducked and dodged hither and thither, to be out of the reach of his
ridingwhip and, all whooping off together, they tumbled, in a pile of
immeasurable giggle, on the withered turf under the verandah, where they
kicked up their heels and shouted to their full satisfaction.
 
"If I had the little devils!" muttered Haley, between his teeth.
 
"But you hant got em, though!" said Andy, with a triumphant flourish,
and making a string of indescribable mouths at the unfortunate traders
back, when he was fairly beyond hearing.
 
"I say now, Shelby, this yer s a most extrornary business!" said
Haley, as he abruptly entered the parlor. "It seems that gal s off,
with her young un."
 
"Mr. Haley, Mrs. Shelby is present," said Mr. Shelby.
 
"I beg pardon, maam," said Haley, bowing slightly, with a still
lowering brow "but still I say, as I said before, this yers a singlar
report. Is it true, sir?"
 
"Sir," said Mr. Shelby, "if you wish to communicate with me, you must
observe something of the decorum of a gentleman. Andy, take Mr. Haleys
hat and ridingwhip. Take a seat, sir. Yes, sir I regret to say that
the young woman, excited by overhearing, or having reported to her,
something of this business, has taken her child in the night, and made
off."
 
"I did expect fair dealing in this matter, I confess," said Haley.
 
"Well, sir," said Mr. Shelby, turning sharply round upon him, "what am
I to understand by that remark? If any man calls my honor in question, I
have but one answer for him."
 
The trader cowered at this, and in a somewhat lower tone said that "it
was plaguy hard on a fellow, that had made a fair bargain, to be gulled
that way."
 
"Mr. Haley," said Mr. Shelby, "if I did not think you had some cause
for disappointment, I should not have borne from you the rude and
unceremonious style of your entrance into my parlor this morning. I say
thus much, however, since appearances call for it, that I shall allow
of no insinuations cast upon me, as if I were at all partner to any
unfairness in this matter. Moreover, I shall feel bound to give you
every assistance, in the use of horses, servants, c., in the recovery
of your property. So, in short, Haley," said he, suddenly dropping from
the tone of dignified coolness to his ordinary one of easy frankness,
"the best way for you is to keep goodnatured and eat some breakfast,
and we will then see what is to be done."
 
Mrs. Shelby now rose, and said her engagements would prevent her being
at the breakfasttable that morning and, deputing a very respectable
mulatto woman to attend to the gentlemens coffee at the sideboard, she
left the room.
 
"Old lady dont like your humble servant, over and above," said Haley,
with an uneasy effort to be very familiar.
 
"I am not accustomed to hear my wife spoken of with such freedom," said
Mr. Shelby, dryly.
 
"Beg pardon of course, only a joke, you know," said Haley, forcing a
laugh.
 
"Some jokes are less agreeable than others," rejoined Shelby.
 
"Devilish free, now Ive signed those papers, cuss him!" muttered Haley
to himself "quite grand, since yesterday!"
 
Never did fall of any prime minister at court occasion wider surges of
sensation than the report of Toms fate among his compeers on the place.
It was the topic in every mouth, everywhere and nothing was done in
the house or in the field, but to discuss its probable results. Elizas
flightan unprecedented event on the placewas also a great accessory
in stimulating the general excitement.
 
Black Sam, as he was commonly called, from his being about three shades
blacker than any other son of ebony on the place, was revolving
the matter profoundly in all its phases and bearings, with a
comprehensiveness of vision and a strict lookout to his own personal
wellbeing, that would have done credit to any white patriot in
Washington.
 
"Its an ill wind dat blow nowhar,dat ar a fact," said Sam,
sententiously, giving an additional hoist to his pantaloons,
and adroitly substituting a long nail in place of a missing
suspenderbutton, with which effort of mechanical genius he seemed
highly delighted.
 
"Yes, its an ill wind blows nowhar," he repeated. "Now, dar, Toms
downwal, course ders room for some nigger to be upand why not
dis nigger?dats de idee. Tom, a ridin round de countryboots
blackedpass in his pocketall grand as Cuffeebut who he? Now, why
shouldnt Sam?dats what I want to know."
 
"Halloo, SamO Sam! Masr wants you to cotch Bill and Jerry," said
Andy, cutting short Sams soliloquy.
 
"High! whats afoot now, young un?"
 
"Why, you dont know, I spose, that Lizys cut stick, and clared out,
with her young un?"
 
"You teach your granny!" said Sam, with infinite contempt "knowed it a
heap sight sooner than you did this nigger ant so green, now!"
 
"Well, anyhow, Masr wants Bill and Jerry geared right up and you and I
s to go with Masr Haley, to look arter her."
 
"Good, now! dats de time o day!" said Sam. "Its Sam dats called
for in dese yer times. Hes de nigger. See if I dont cotch her, now
Masrll see what Sam can do!"
 
"Ah! but, Sam," said Andy, "youd better think twice for Missis dont
want her cotched, and shell be in yer wool."
 
"High!" said Sam, opening his eyes. "How you know dat?"
 
"Heard her say so, my own self, dis blessed mornin, when I bring in
Masrs shavingwater. She sent me to see why Lizy didnt come to dress
her and when I telled her she was off, she jest ris up, and ses she,
The Lord be praised and Masr, he seemed rael mad, and ses he, Wife,
you talk like a fool. But Lor! shell bring him to! I knows well enough
how thatll be,its allers best to stand Missis side the fence, now I
tell yer."
 
Black Sam, upon this, scratched his woolly pate, which, if it did
not contain very profound wisdom, still contained a great deal of a
particular species much in demand among politicians of all complexions
and countries, and vulgarly denominated "knowing which side the bread is
buttered" so, stopping with grave consideration, he again gave a hitch
to his pantaloons, which was his regularly organized method of assisting
his mental perplexities.
 
"Der ant no sayingneverbout no kind o thing in _dis_ yer world,"
he said, at last. Sam spoke like a philosopher, emphasizing _this_as
if he had had a large experience in different sorts of worlds, and
therefore had come to his conclusions advisedly.
 
"Now, sartin Id a said that Missis would a scoured the varsal world
after Lizy," added Sam, thoughtfully.
 
"So she would," said Andy "but cant ye see through a ladder, ye black
nigger? Missis dont want dis yer Masr Haley to get Lizys boy dats
de go!"
 
"High!" said Sam, with an indescribable intonation, known only to those
who have heard it among the negroes.
 
"And Ill tell yer more n all," said Andy "I specs youd better be
making tracks for dem hosses,mighty sudden, too,for I hearn Missis
quirin arter yer,so youve stood foolin long enough."
 
Sam, upon this, began to bestir himself in real earnest, and after a
while appeared, bearing down gloriously towards the house, with Bill and
Jerry in a full canter, and adroitly throwing himself off before they
had any idea of stopping, he brought them up alongside of the horsepost
like a tornado. Haleys horse, which was a skittish young colt, winced,
and bounced, and pulled hard at his halter.
 
"Ho, ho!" said Sam, "skeery, ar ye?" and his black visage lighted up
with a curious, mischievous gleam. "Ill fix ye now!" said he.
 
There was a large beechtree overshadowing the place, and the small,
sharp, triangular beechnuts lay scattered thickly on the ground.
With one of these in his fingers, Sam approached the colt, stroked
and patted, and seemed apparently busy in soothing his agitation. On
pretence of adjusting the saddle, he adroitly slipped under it the sharp
little nut, in such a manner that the least weight brought upon the
saddle would annoy the nervous sensibilities of the animal, without
leaving any perceptible graze or wound.
 
"Dar!" he said, rolling his eyes with an approving grin "me fix em!"
 
At this moment Mrs. Shelby appeared on the balcony, beckoning to him.
Sam approached with as good a determination to pay court as did ever
suitor after a vacant place at St. James or Washington.
 
"Why have you been loitering so, Sam? I sent Andy to tell you to hurry."
 
"Lord bless you, Missis!" said Sam, "horses wont be cotched all in a
minit theyd done clared out way down to the south pasture, and the
Lord knows whar!"
 
"Sam, how often must I tell you not to say Lord bless you, and the Lord
knows, and such things? Its wicked."
 
"O, Lord bless my soul! I done forgot, Missis! I wont say nothing of de
sort no more."
 
"Why, Sam, you just _have_ said it again."
 
"Did I? O, Lord! I meanI didnt go fur to say it."
 
"You must be _careful_, Sam."
 
"Just let me get my breath, Missis, and Ill start fair. Ill be bery
careful."
 
"Well, Sam, you are to go with Mr. Haley, to show him the road, and help
him. Be careful of the horses, Sam you know Jerry was a little lame
last week _dont ride them too fast_."
 
Mrs. Shelby spoke the last words with a low voice, and strong emphasis.
 
"Let dis child alone for dat!" said Sam, rolling up his eyes with a
volume of meaning. "Lord knows! High! Didnt say dat!" said he, suddenly
catching his breath, with a ludicrous flourish of apprehension, which
made his mistress laugh, spite of herself. "Yes, Missis, Ill look out
for de hosses!"
 
"Now, Andy," said Sam, returning to his stand under the beechtrees,
"you see I wouldnt be t all surprised if dat ar genlmans crittur
should gib a fling, by and by, when he comes to be a gettin up. You
know, Andy, critturs _will_ do such things" and therewith Sam poked
Andy in the side, in a highly suggestive manner.
 
"High!" said Andy, with an air of instant appreciation.
 
"Yes, you see, Andy, Missis wants to make time,dat ars clar to der
most ornary bserver. I jis make a little for her. Now, you see, get
all dese yer hosses loose, caperin permiscus round dis yer lot and down
to de wood dar, and I spec Masr wont be off in a hurry."
 
Andy grinned.
 
"Yer see," said Sam, "yer see, Andy, if any such thing should happen as
that Masr Haleys horse _should_ begin to act contrary, and cut up, you
and I jist lets go of ourn to help him, and _well help him_oh yes!"
And Sam and Andy laid their heads back on their shoulders, and broke
into a low, immoderate laugh, snapping their fingers and flourishing
their heels with exquisite delight.
 
At this instant, Haley appeared on the verandah. Somewhat mollified by
certain cups of very good coffee, he came out smiling and talking, in
tolerably restored humor. Sam and Andy, clawing for certain fragmentary
palmleaves, which they were in the habit of considering as hats, flew
to the horseposts, to be ready to "help Masr."
 
Sams palmleaf had been ingeniously disentangled from all pretensions
to braid, as respects its brim and the slivers starting apart, and
standing upright, gave it a blazing air of freedom and defiance, quite
equal to that of any Fejee chief while the whole brim of Andys being
departed bodily, he rapped the crown on his head with a dexterous thump,
and looked about well pleased, as if to say, "Who says I havent got a
hat?"
 
"Well, boys," said Haley, "look alive now we must lose no time."
 
"Not a bit of him, Masr!" said Sam, putting Haleys rein in his hand,
and holding his stirrup, while Andy was untying the other two horses.
 
The instant Haley touched the saddle, the mettlesome creature bounded
from the earth with a sudden spring, that threw his master sprawling,
some feet off, on the soft, dry turf. Sam, with frantic ejaculations,
made a dive at the reins, but only succeeded in brushing the blazing
palmleaf aforenamed into the horses eyes, which by no means tended
to allay the confusion of his nerves. So, with great vehemence, he
overturned Sam, and, giving two or three contemptuous snorts, flourished
his heels vigorously in the air, and was soon prancing away towards the
lower end of the lawn, followed by Bill and Jerry, whom Andy had not
failed to let loose, according to contract, speeding them off with
various direful ejaculations. And now ensued a miscellaneous scene
of confusion. Sam and Andy ran and shouted,dogs barked here and
there,and Mike, Mose, Mandy, Fanny, and all the smaller specimens
on the place, both male and female, raced, clapped hands, whooped, and
shouted, with outrageous officiousness and untiring zeal.
 
Haleys horse, which was a white one, and very fleet and spirited,
appeared to enter into the spirit of the scene with great gusto and
having for his coursing ground a lawn of nearly half a mile in extent,
gently sloping down on every side into indefinite woodland, he appeared
to take infinite delight in seeing how near he could allow his pursuers
to approach him, and then, when within a hands breadth, whisk off with
a start and a snort, like a mischievous beast as he was and career far
down into some alley of the woodlot. Nothing was further from Sams
mind than to have any one of the troop taken until such season as
should seem to him most befitting,and the exertions that he made were
certainly most heroic. Like the sword of Coeur De Lion, which always
blazed in the front and thickest of the battle, Sams palmleaf was to
be seen everywhere when there was the least danger that a horse could be
caught there he would bear down full tilt, shouting, "Now for it! cotch
him! cotch him!" in a way that would set everything to indiscriminate
rout in a moment.
 
Haley ran up and down, and cursed and swore and stamped miscellaneously.
Mr. Shelby in vain tried to shout directions from the balcony, and Mrs.
Shelby from her chamber window alternately laughed and wondered,not
without some inkling of what lay at the bottom of all this confusion.
 
At last, about twelve oclock, Sam appeared triumphant, mounted on
Jerry, with Haleys horse by his side, reeking with sweat, but with
flashing eyes and dilated nostrils, showing that the spirit of freedom
had not yet entirely subsided.
 
"Hes cotched!" he exclaimed, triumphantly. "If t hadnt been for me,
they might a bust themselves, all on em but I cotched him!"
 
"You!" growled Haley, in no amiable mood. "If it hadnt been for you,
this never would have happened."
 
"Lord bless us, Masr," said Sam, in a tone of the deepest concern, "and
me that has been racin and chasin till the sweat jest pours off me!"
 
"Well, well!" said Haley, "youve lost me near three hours, with your
cursed nonsense. Now lets be off, and have no more fooling."
 
"Why, Masr," said Sam, in a deprecating tone, "I believe you mean to
kill us all clar, horses and all. Here we are all just ready to drop
down, and the critters all in a reek of sweat. Why, Masr wont think of
startin on now till arter dinner. Masrs hoss wants rubben down see
how he splashed hisself and Jerry limps too dont think Missis would
be willin to have us start dis yer way, no how. Lord bless you, Masr,
we can ketch up, if we do stop. Lizy never was no great of a walker."
 
Mrs. Shelby, who, greatly to her amusement, had overheard this
conversation from the verandah, now resolved to do her part. She came
forward, and, courteously expressing her concern for Haleys accident,
pressed him to stay to dinner, saying that the cook should bring it on
the table immediately.
 
Thus, all things considered, Haley, with rather an equivocal grace,
proceeded to the parlor, while Sam, rolling his eyes after him
with unutterable meaning, proceeded gravely with the horses to the
stableyard.
 
"Did yer see him, Andy? _did_ yer see him?" said Sam, when he had got
fairly beyond the shelter of the barn, and fastened the horse to a post.
"O, Lor, if it warnt as good as a meetin, now, to see him a dancin
and kickin and swarin at us. Didnt I hear him? Swar away, ole fellow
says I to myself  will yer have yer hoss now, or wait till you cotch
him? says I. Lor, Andy, I think I can see him now." And Sam and Andy
leaned up against the barn and laughed to their hearts content.
 
"Yer oughter seen how mad he looked, when I brought the hoss up.
Lord, hed a killed me, if he durs to and there I was a standin as
innercent and as humble."
 
"Lor, I seed you," said Andy "ant you an old hoss, Sam?"
 
"Rather specks I am," said Sam "did yer see Missis up stars at the
winder? I seed her laughin."
 
"Im sure, I was racin so, I didnt see nothing," said Andy.
 
"Well, yer see," said Sam, proceeding gravely to wash down Haleys pony,
"I se quired what yer may call a habit _o bobservation_, Andy. Its a
very portant habit, Andy and I commend yer to be cultivatin it,
now yer young. Hist up that hind foot, Andy. Yer see, Andy, its
_bobservation_ makes all de difference in niggers. Didnt I see which
way the wind blew dis yer mornin? Didnt I see what Missis wanted,
though she never let on? Dat ars bobservation, Andy. I spects its
what you may call a faculty. Faculties is different in different
peoples, but cultivation of em goes a great way."
 
"I guess if I hadnt helped your bobservation dis mornin, yer wouldnt
have seen your way so smart," said Andy.
 
"Andy," said Sam, "yous a promisin child, der ant no manner o doubt.
I thinks lots of yer, Andy and I dont feel no ways ashamed to take
idees from you. We oughtenter overlook nobody, Andy, cause the smartest
on us gets tripped up sometimes. And so, Andy, lets go up to the house
now. Ill be boun Missisll give us an uncommon good bite, dis yer
time."
 
 
 
CHAPTER VII
 
The Mothers Struggle
 
 
It is impossible to conceive of a human creature more wholly desolate
and forlorn than Eliza, when she turned her footsteps from Uncle Toms
cabin.
 
Her husbands suffering and dangers, and the danger of her child, all
blended in her mind, with a confused and stunning sense of the risk she
was running, in leaving the only home she had ever known, and cutting
loose from the protection of a friend whom she loved and revered. Then
there was the parting from every familiar object,the place where she
had grown up, the trees under which she had played, the groves where
she had walked many an evening in happier days, by the side of her young
husband,everything, as it lay in the clear, frosty starlight, seemed
to speak reproachfully to her, and ask her whither could she go from a
home like that?
 
But stronger than all was maternal love, wrought into a paroxysm of
frenzy by the near approach of a fearful danger. Her boy was old enough
to have walked by her side, and, in an indifferent case, she would only
have led him by the hand but now the bare thought of putting him out
of her arms made her shudder, and she strained him to her bosom with a
convulsive grasp, as she went rapidly forward.
 
The frosty ground creaked beneath her feet, and she trembled at the
sound every quaking leaf and fluttering shadow sent the blood backward
to her heart, and quickened her footsteps. She wondered within herself
at the strength that seemed to be come upon her for she felt the weight
of her boy as if it had been a feather, and every flutter of fear seemed
to increase the supernatural power that bore her on, while from her
pale lips burst forth, in frequent ejaculations, the prayer to a Friend
above"Lord, help! Lord, save me!"
 
If it were _your_ Harry, mother, or your Willie, that were going to be
torn from you by a brutal trader, tomorrow morning,if you had seen the
man, and heard that the papers were signed and delivered, and you had
only from twelve oclock till morning to make good your escape,how
fast could _you_ walk? How many miles could you make in those few brief
hours, with the darling at your bosom,the little sleepy head on your
shoulder,the small, soft arms trustingly holding on to your neck?
 
For the child slept. At first, the novelty and alarm kept him waking
but his mother so hurriedly repressed every breath or sound, and so
assured him that if he were only still she would certainly save him,
that he clung quietly round her neck, only asking, as he found himself
sinking to sleep,
 
"Mother, I dont need to keep awake, do I?"
 
"No, my darling sleep, if you want to."
 
"But, mother, if I do get asleep, you wont let him get me?"
 
"No! so may God help me!" said his mother, with a paler cheek, and a
brighter light in her large dark eyes.
 
"Youre _sure_, ant you, mother?"
 
"Yes, _sure_!" said the mother, in a voice that startled herself for it
seemed to her to come from a spirit within, that was no part of her
and the boy dropped his little weary head on her shoulder, and was soon
asleep. How the touch of those warm arms, the gentle breathings that
came in her neck, seemed to add fire and spirit to her movements! It
seemed to her as if strength poured into her in electric streams,
from every gentle touch and movement of the sleeping, confiding child.
Sublime is the dominion of the mind over the body, that, for a time, can
make flesh and nerve impregnable, and string the sinews like steel, so
that the weak become so mighty.
 
The boundaries of the farm, the grove, the woodlot, passed by her
dizzily, as she walked on and still she went, leaving one familiar
object after another, slacking not, pausing not, till reddening daylight
found her many a long mile from all traces of any familiar objects upon
the open highway.
 
She had often been, with her mistress, to visit some connections, in the
little village of T, not far from the Ohio river, and knew the road
well. To go thither, to escape across the Ohio river, were the first
hurried outlines of her plan of escape beyond that, she could only hope
in God.
 
When horses and vehicles began to move along the highway, with that
alert perception peculiar to a state of excitement, and which seems to
be a sort of inspiration, she became aware that her headlong pace and
distracted air might bring on her remark and suspicion. She therefore
put the boy on the ground, and, adjusting her dress and bonnet,
she walked on at as rapid a pace as she thought consistent with the
preservation of appearances. In her little bundle she had provided a
store of cakes and apples, which she used as expedients for quickening
the speed of the child, rolling the apple some yards before them, when
the boy would run with all his might after it and this ruse, often
repeated, carried them over many a halfmile.
 
After a while, they came to a thick patch of woodland, through which
murmured a clear brook. As the child complained of hunger and thirst,
she climbed over the fence with him and, sitting down behind a large
rock which concealed them from the road, she gave him a breakfast out of
her little package. The boy wondered and grieved that she could not eat
and when, putting his arms round her neck, he tried to wedge some of
his cake into her mouth, it seemed to her that the rising in her throat
would choke her.
 
"No, no, Harry darling! mother cant eat till you are safe! We must go
onontill we come to the river!" And she hurried again into the road,
and again constrained herself to walk regularly and composedly forward.
 
She was many miles past any neighborhood where she was personally known.
If she should chance to meet any who knew her, she reflected that
the wellknown kindness of the family would be of itself a blind to
suspicion, as making it an unlikely supposition that she could be a
fugitive. As she was also so white as not to be known as of colored
lineage, without a critical survey, and her child was white also, it was
much easier for her to pass on unsuspected.
 
On this presumption, she stopped at noon at a neat farmhouse, to rest
herself, and buy some dinner for her child and self for, as the danger
decreased with the distance, the supernatural tension of the nervous
system lessened, and she found herself both weary and hungry.
 
The good woman, kindly and gossipping, seemed rather pleased than
otherwise with having somebody come in to talk with and accepted,
without examination, Elizas statement, that she "was going on a little
piece, to spend a week with her friends,"all which she hoped in her
heart might prove strictly true.
 
An hour before sunset, she entered the village of T, by the Ohio
river, weary and footsore, but still strong in heart. Her first glance
was at the river, which lay, like Jordan, between her and the Canaan of
liberty on the other side.
 
It was now early spring, and the river was swollen and turbulent great
cakes of floating ice were swinging heavily to and fro in the turbid
waters. Owing to the peculiar form of the shore on the Kentucky side,
the land bending far out into the water, the ice had been lodged and
detained in great quantities, and the narrow channel which swept round
the bend was full of ice, piled one cake over another, thus forming
a temporary barrier to the descending ice, which lodged, and formed a
great, undulating raft, filling up the whole river, and extending almost
to the Kentucky shore.
 
Eliza stood, for a moment, contemplating this unfavorable aspect of
things, which she saw at once must prevent the usual ferryboat from
running, and then turned into a small public house on the bank, to make
a few inquiries.
 
The hostess, who was busy in various fizzing and stewing operations over
the fire, preparatory to the evening meal, stopped, with a fork in her
hand, as Elizas sweet and plaintive voice arrested her.
 
"What is it?" she said.
 
"Isnt there any ferry or boat, that takes people over to B, now?"
she said.
 
"No, indeed!" said the woman "the boats has stopped running."
 
Elizas look of dismay and disappointment struck the woman, and she
said, inquiringly,
 
"May be youre wanting to get over?anybody sick? Ye seem mighty
anxious?"
 
"Ive got a child thats very dangerous," said Eliza. "I never heard of
it till last night, and Ive walked quite a piece today, in hopes to get
to the ferry."
 
"Well, now, thats onlucky," said the woman, whose motherly sympathies
were much aroused "Im relly consarned for ye. Solomon!" she called,
from the window, towards a small back building. A man, in leather apron
and very dirty hands, appeared at the door.
 
"I say, Sol," said the woman, "is that ar man going to tote them barls
over tonight?"
 
"He said he should try, if t was any way prudent," said the man.
 
"Theres a man a piece down here, thats going over with some truck this
evening, if he durs to hell be in here to supper tonight, so youd
better set down and wait. Thats a sweet little fellow," added the
woman, offering him a cake.
 
But the child, wholly exhausted, cried with weariness.
 
"Poor fellow! he isnt used to walking, and Ive hurried him on so,"
said Eliza.
 
"Well, take him into this room," said the woman, opening into a small
bedroom, where stood a comfortable bed. Eliza laid the weary boy upon
it, and held his hands in hers till he was fast asleep. For her there
was no rest. As a fire in her bones, the thought of the pursuer urged
her on and she gazed with longing eyes on the sullen, surging waters
that lay between her and liberty.
 
Here we must take our leave of her for the present, to follow the course
of her pursuers.
 
 
Though Mrs. Shelby had promised that the dinner should be hurried on
table, yet it was soon seen, as the thing has often been seen before,
that it required more than one to make a bargain. So, although the order
was fairly given out in Haleys hearing, and carried to Aunt Chloe by at
least half a dozen juvenile messengers, that dignitary only gave certain
very gruff snorts, and tosses of her head, and went on with every
operation in an unusually leisurely and circumstantial manner.
 
For some singular reason, an impression seemed to reign among the
servants generally that Missis would not be particularly disobliged by
delay and it was wonderful what a number of counter accidents occurred
constantly, to retard the course of things. One luckless wight contrived
to upset the gravy and then gravy had to be got up _de novo_, with
due care and formality, Aunt Chloe watching and stirring with dogged
precision, answering shortly, to all suggestions of haste, that she
"warnt a going to have raw gravy on the table, to help nobodys
catchings." One tumbled down with the water, and had to go to the spring
for more and another precipitated the butter into the path of events
and there was from time to time giggling news brought into the kitchen
that "Masr Haley was mighty oneasy, and that he couldnt sit in his
cheer no ways, but was a walkin and stalkin to the winders and through
the porch."
 
"Sarves him right!" said Aunt Chloe, indignantly. "Hell get wus nor
oneasy, one of these days, if he dont mend his ways. _His_ masterll be
sending for him, and then see how hell look!"
 
"Hell go to torment, and no mistake," said little Jake.
 
"He desarves it!" said Aunt Chloe, grimly "hes broke a many, many,
many hearts,I tell ye all!" she said, stopping, with a fork uplifted
in her hands "its like what Masr George reads in Ravelations,souls
a callin under the altar! and a callin on the Lord for vengeance on
sich!and by and by the Lord hell hear emso he will!"
 
Aunt Chloe, who was much revered in the kitchen, was listened to with
open mouth and, the dinner being now fairly sent in, the whole kitchen
was at leisure to gossip with her, and to listen to her remarks.
 
"Sichll be burnt up forever, and no mistake wont ther?" said Andy.
 
"Id be glad to see it, Ill be boun," said little Jake.
 
"Chilen!" said a voice, that made them all start. It was Uncle Tom, who
had come in, and stood listening to the conversation at the door.
 
"Chilen!" he said, "Im afeard you dont know what yere sayin.
Forever is a _dreful_ word, chilen its awful to think on t. You
oughtenter wish that ar to any human crittur."
 
"We wouldnt to anybody but the souldrivers," said Andy "nobody can
help wishing it to them, they s so awful wicked."
 
"Dont natur herself kinder cry out on em?" said Aunt Chloe. "Dont dey
tear der suckin baby right off his mothers breast, and sell him, and
der little children as is crying and holding on by her clothes,dont
dey pull em off and sells em? Dont dey tear wife and husband apart?"
said Aunt Chloe, beginning to cry, "when its jest takin the very life
on em?and all the while does they feel one bit, dont dey drink and
smoke, and take it oncommon easy? Lor, if the devil dont get them,
whats he good for?" And Aunt Chloe covered her face with her checked
apron, and began to sob in good earnest.
 
"Pray for them that spitefully use you, the good book says," says Tom.
 
"Pray for em!" said Aunt Chloe "Lor, its too tough! I cant pray for
em."
 
"Its natur, Chloe, and natur s strong," said Tom, "but the Lords
grace is stronger besides, you oughter think what an awful state a poor
critturs soul s in thatll do them ar things,you oughter thank
God that you ant _like_ him, Chloe. Im sure Id rather be sold, ten
thousand times over, than to have all that ar poor critturs got to
answer for."
 
"So d I, a heap," said Jake. "Lor, _shouldnt_ we cotch it, Andy?"
 
Andy shrugged his shoulders, and gave an acquiescent whistle.
 
"Im glad Masr didnt go off this morning, as he looked to," said Tom
"that ar hurt me more than sellin, it did. Mebbe it might have been
natural for him, but t would have come despt hard on me, as has known
him from a baby but Ive seen Masr, and I begin ter feel sort o
reconciled to the Lords will now. Masr couldnt help hisself he did
right, but Im feared things will be kinder goin to rack, when Im gone
Masr cant be spected to be a pryin round everywhar, as Ive done, a
keepin up all the ends. The boys all means well, but they s powerful
carless. That ar troubles me."
 
The bell here rang, and Tom was summoned to the parlor.
 
"Tom," said his master, kindly, "I want you to notice that I give this
gentleman bonds to forfeit a thousand dollars if you are not on the spot
when he wants you hes going today to look after his other business,
and you can have the day to yourself. Go anywhere you like, boy."
 
"Thank you, Masr," said Tom.
 
"And mind yourself," said the trader, "and dont come it over your
master with any o yer nigger tricks for Ill take every cent out of
him, if you ant thar. If hed hear to me, he wouldnt trust any on
yeslippery as eels!"
 
"Masr," said Tom,and he stood very straight,"I was jist eight years
old when ole Missis put you into my arms, and you wasnt a year old.
Thar, says she, Tom, thats to be _your_ young Masr take good care
on him, says she. And now I jist ask you, Masr, have I ever broke word
to you, or gone contrary to you, specially since I was a Christian?"
 
Mr. Shelby was fairly overcome, and the tears rose to his eyes.
 
"My good boy," said he, "the Lord knows you say but the truth and if I
was able to help it, all the world shouldnt buy you."
 
"And sure as I am a Christian woman," said Mrs. Shelby, "you shall be
redeemed as soon as I can any bring together means. Sir," she said to
Haley, "take good account of who you sell him to, and let me know."
 
"Lor, yes, for that matter," said the trader, "I may bring him up in a
year, not much the wuss for wear, and trade him back."
 
"Ill trade with you then, and make it for your advantage," said Mrs.
Shelby.
 
"Of course," said the trader, "all s equal with me lives trade em
up as down, so I does a good business. All I want is a livin, you know,
maam thats all any on us wants, I, spose."
 
Mr. and Mrs. Shelby both felt annoyed and degraded by the familiar
impudence of the trader, and yet both saw the absolute necessity of
putting a constraint on their feelings. The more hopelessly sordid and
insensible he appeared, the greater became Mrs. Shelbys dread of his
succeeding in recapturing Eliza and her child, and of course the greater
her motive for detaining him by every female artifice. She therefore
graciously smiled, assented, chatted familiarly, and did all she could
to make time pass imperceptibly.
 
At two oclock Sam and Andy brought the horses up to the posts,
apparently greatly refreshed and invigorated by the scamper of the
morning.
 
Sam was there new oiled from dinner, with an abundance of zealous
and ready officiousness. As Haley approached, he was boasting, in
flourishing style, to Andy, of the evident and eminent success of the
operation, now that he had "farly come to it."
 
"Your master, I spose, dont keep no dogs," said Haley, thoughtfully,
as he prepared to mount.
 
"Heaps on em," said Sam, triumphantly "thars Brunohes a roarer!
and, besides that, bout every nigger of us keeps a pup of some natur or
uther."
 
"Poh!" said Haley,and he said something else, too, with regard to the
said dogs, at which Sam muttered,
 
"I dont see no use cussin on em, no way."
 
"But your master dont keep no dogs I pretty much know he dont for
trackin out niggers."
 
Sam knew exactly what he meant, but he kept on a look of earnest and
desperate simplicity.
 
"Our dogs all smells round considable sharp. I spect theys the kind,
though they hant never had no practice. They s _far_ dogs, though,
at most anything, if youd get em started. Here, Bruno," he called,
whistling to the lumbering Newfoundland, who came pitching tumultuously
toward them.
 
"You go hang!" said Haley, getting up. "Come, tumble up now."
 
Sam tumbled up accordingly, dexterously contriving to tickle Andy as
he did so, which occasioned Andy to split out into a laugh, greatly to
Haleys indignation, who made a cut at him with his ridingwhip.
 
"I s stonished at yer, Andy," said Sam, with awful gravity. "This
yers a seris bisness, Andy. Yer mustnt be a makin game. This yer ant
no way to help Masr."
 
"I shall take the straight road to the river," said Haley, decidedly,
after they had come to the boundaries of the estate. "I know the way of
all of em,they makes tracks for the underground."
 
"Sartin," said Sam, "dats de idee. Masr Haley hits de thing right
in de middle. Now, ders two roads to de river,de dirt road and der
pike,which Masr mean to take?"
 
Andy looked up innocently at Sam, surprised at hearing this new
geographical fact, but instantly confirmed what he said, by a vehement
reiteration.
 
"Cause," said Sam, "Id rather be clined to magine that Lizy d take
de dirt road, bein its the least travelled."
 
Haley, notwithstanding that he was a very old bird, and naturally
inclined to be suspicious of chaff, was rather brought up by this view
of the case.
 
"If yer warnt both on yer such cussed liars, now!" he said,
contemplatively as he pondered a moment.
 
The pensive, reflective tone in which this was spoken appeared to
amuse Andy prodigiously, and he drew a little behind, and shook so as
apparently to run a great risk of failing off his horse, while Sams
face was immovably composed into the most doleful gravity.
 
"Course," said Sam, "Masr can do as hed ruther, go de straight road,
if Masr thinks best,its all one to us. Now, when I study pon it, I
think de straight road de best, _deridedly_."
 
"She would naturally go a lonesome way," said Haley, thinking aloud, and
not minding Sams remark.
 
"Dar ant no sayin," said Sam "gals is pecular they never does
nothin ye thinks they will mose genlly the contrary. Gals is natlly
made contrary and so, if you thinks theyve gone one road, it is sartin
youd better go t other, and then youll be sure to find em. Now, my
private pinion is, Lizy took der road so I think wed better take de
straight one."
 
This profound generic view of the female sex did not seem to dispose
Haley particularly to the straight road, and he announced decidedly that
he should go the other, and asked Sam when they should come to it.
 
"A little piece ahead," said Sam, giving a wink to Andy with the eye
which was on Andys side of the head and he added, gravely, "but Ive
studded on de matter, and Im quite clar we ought not to go dat ar way.
I nebber been over it no way. Its despit lonesome, and we might lose
our way,whar wed come to, de Lord only knows."
 
"Nevertheless," said Haley, "I shall go that way."
 
"Now I think on t, I think I hearn em tell that dat ar road was all
fenced up and down by der creek, and thar, ant it, Andy?"
 
Andy wasnt certain hed only "hearn tell" about that road, but never
been over it. In short, he was strictly noncommittal.
 
Haley, accustomed to strike the balance of probabilities between lies
of greater or lesser magnitude, thought that it lay in favor of the dirt
road aforesaid. The mention of the thing he thought he perceived
was involuntary on Sams part at first, and his confused attempts to
dissuade him he set down to a desperate lying on second thoughts, as
being unwilling to implicate Liza.
 
When, therefore, Sam indicated the road, Haley plunged briskly into it,
followed by Sam and Andy.
 
Now, the road, in fact, was an old one, that had formerly been a
thoroughfare to the river, but abandoned for many years after the laying
of the new pike. It was open for about an hours ride, and after that it
was cut across by various farms and fences. Sam knew this fact perfectly
well,indeed, the road had been so long closed up, that Andy had never
heard of it. He therefore rode along with an air of dutiful submission,
only groaning and vociferating occasionally that t was "despt rough,
and bad for Jerrys foot."
 
"Now, I jest give yer warning," said Haley, "I know yer yer wont get
me to turn off this road, with all yer fussinso you shet up!"
 
"Masr will go his own way!" said Sam, with rueful submission, at the
same time winking most portentously to Andy, whose delight was now very
near the explosive point.
 
Sam was in wonderful spirits,professed to keep a very brisk
lookout,at one time exclaiming that he saw "a gals bonnet" on the top
of some distant eminence, or calling to Andy "if that thar wasnt Lizy
down in the hollow" always making these exclamations in some rough
or craggy part of the road, where the sudden quickening of speed was a
special inconvenience to all parties concerned, and thus keeping Haley
in a state of constant commotion.
 
After riding about an hour in this way, the whole party made a
precipitate and tumultuous descent into a barnyard belonging to a large
farming establishment. Not a soul was in sight, all the hands being
employed in the fields but, as the barn stood conspicuously and plainly
square across the road, it was evident that their journey in that
direction had reached a decided finale.
 
"Want dat ar what I telled Masr?" said Sam, with an air of injured
innocence. "How does strange gentleman spect to know more about a
country dan de natives born and raised?"
 
"You rascal!" said Haley, "you knew all about this."
 
"Didnt I tell yer I _knowd_, and yer wouldnt believe me? I telled
Masr t was all shet up, and fenced up, and I didnt spect we could get
through,Andy heard me."
 
It was all too true to be disputed, and the unlucky man had to pocket
his wrath with the best grace he was able, and all three faced to the
right about, and took up their line of march for the highway.
 
In consequence of all the various delays, it was about threequarters
of an hour after Eliza had laid her child to sleep in the village tavern
that the party came riding into the same place. Eliza was standing
by the window, looking out in another direction, when Sams quick eye
caught a glimpse of her. Haley and Andy were two yards behind. At this
crisis, Sam contrived to have his hat blown off, and uttered a loud
and characteristic ejaculation, which startled her at once she drew
suddenly back the whole train swept by the window, round to the front
door.
 
A thousand lives seemed to be concentrated in that one moment to Eliza.
Her room opened by a side door to the river. She caught her child, and
sprang down the steps towards it. The trader caught a full glimpse of
her just as she was disappearing down the bank and throwing himself
from his horse, and calling loudly on Sam and Andy, he was after her
like a hound after a deer. In that dizzy moment her feet to her scarce
seemed to touch the ground, and a moment brought her to the waters
edge. Right on behind they came and, nerved with strength such as God
gives only to the desperate, with one wild cry and flying leap, she
vaulted sheer over the turbid current by the shore, on to the raft of
ice beyond. It was a desperate leapimpossible to anything but madness
and despair and Haley, Sam, and Andy, instinctively cried out, and
lifted up their hands, as she did it.
 
The huge green fragment of ice on which she alighted pitched and creaked
as her weight came on it, but she staid there not a moment. With wild
cries and desperate energy she leaped to another and still another cake
stumblingleapingslippingspringing upwards again! Her shoes are
goneher stockings cut from her feetwhile blood marked every step
but she saw nothing, felt nothing, till dimly, as in a dream, she saw
the Ohio side, and a man helping her up the bank.
 
"Yer a brave gal, now, whoever ye ar!" said the man, with an oath.
 
Eliza recognized the voice and face for a man who owned a farm not far
from her old home.
 
"O, Mr. Symmes!save medo save medo hide me!" said Elia.
 
"Why, whats this?" said the man. "Why, if tant Shelbys gal!"
 
"My child!this boy!hed sold him! There is his Masr," said she,
pointing to the Kentucky shore. "O, Mr. Symmes, youve got a little
boy!"
 
"So I have," said the man, as he roughly, but kindly, drew her up the
steep bank. "Besides, youre a right brave gal. I like grit, wherever I
see it."
 
When they had gained the top of the bank, the man paused.
 
"Id be glad to do something for ye," said he "but then theres nowhar
I could take ye. The best I can do is to tell ye to go _thar_," said
he, pointing to a large white house which stood by itself, off the main
street of the village. "Go thar theyre kind folks. Thars no kind o
danger but theyll help you,theyre up to all that sort o thing."
 
"The Lord bless you!" said Eliza, earnestly.
 
"No casion, no casion in the world," said the man. "What Ive dones
of no count."
 
"And, oh, surely, sir, you wont tell any one!"
 
"Go to thunder, gal! What do you take a feller for? In course not," said
the man. "Come, now, go along like a likely, sensible gal, as you are.
Youve arnt your liberty, and you shall have it, for all me."
 
The woman folded her child to her bosom, and walked firmly and swiftly
away. The man stood and looked after her.
 
"Shelby, now, mebbe wont think this yer the most neighborly thing in
the world but whats a feller to do? If he catches one of my gals in
the same fix, hes welcome to pay back. Somehow I never could see no
kind o critter a strivin and pantin, and trying to clar theirselves,
with the dogs arter em and go agin em. Besides, I dont see no kind of
casion for me to be hunter and catcher for other folks, neither."
 
So spoke this poor, heathenish Kentuckian, who had not been instructed
in his constitutional relations, and consequently was betrayed into
acting in a sort of Christianized manner, which, if he had been better
situated and more enlightened, he would not have been left to do.
 
Haley had stood a perfectly amazed spectator of the scene, till Eliza
had disappeared up the bank, when he turned a blank, inquiring look on
Sam and Andy.
 
"That ar was a tolable fair stroke of business," said Sam.
 
"The gal s got seven devils in her, I believe!" said Haley. "How like a
wildcat she jumped!"
 
"Wal, now," said Sam, scratching his head, "I hope Masrll scuse us
trying dat ar road. Dont think I feel spry enough for dat ar, no way!"
and Sam gave a hoarse chuckle.
 
"_You_ laugh!" said the trader, with a growl.
 
"Lord bless you, Masr, I couldnt help it now," said Sam, giving way to
the long pentup delight of his soul. "She looked so curis, a leapin
and springinice a crackinand only to hear her,plump! ker chunk!
ker splash! Spring! Lord! how she goes it!" and Sam and Andy laughed
till the tears rolled down their cheeks.
 
"Ill make ye laugh t other side yer mouths!" said the trader, laying
about their heads with his ridingwhip.
 
Both ducked, and ran shouting up the bank, and were on their horses
before he was up.
 
"Goodevening, Masr!" said Sam, with much gravity. "I berry much spect
Missis be anxious bout Jerry. Masr Haley wont want us no longer.
Missis wouldnt hear of our ridin the critters over Lizys bridge
tonight" and, with a facetious poke into Andys ribs, he started off,
followed by the latter, at full speed,their shouts of laughter coming
faintly on the wind.
 
 
 
CHAPTER VIII
 
Elizas Escape
 
 
Eliza made her desperate retreat across the river just in the dusk
of twilight. The gray mist of evening, rising slowly from the river,
enveloped her as she disappeared up the bank, and the swollen current
and floundering masses of ice presented a hopeless barrier between her
and her pursuer. Haley therefore slowly and discontentedly returned
to the little tavern, to ponder further what was to be done. The woman
opened to him the door of a little parlor, covered with a rag carpet,
where stood a table with a very shining black oilcloth, sundry lank,
highbacked wood chairs, with some plaster images in resplendent colors
on the mantelshelf, above a very dimlysmoking grate a long hardwood
settle extended its uneasy length by the chimney, and here Haley sat
him down to meditate on the instability of human hopes and happiness in
general.
 
"What did I want with the little cuss, now," he said to himself, "that
I should have got myself treed like a coon, as I am, this yer way?" and
Haley relieved himself by repeating over a not very select litany of
imprecations on himself, which, though there was the best possible
reason to consider them as true, we shall, as a matter of taste, omit.
 
He was startled by the loud and dissonant voice of a man who was
apparently dismounting at the door. He hurried to the window.
 
"By the land! if this yer ant the nearest, now, to what Ive heard
folks call Providence," said Haley. "I do blieve that ars Tom Loker."
 
Haley hastened out. Standing by the bar, in the corner of the room,
was a brawny, muscular man, full six feet in height, and broad in
proportion. He was dressed in a coat of buffaloskin, made with the hair
outward, which gave him a shaggy and fierce appearance, perfectly in
keeping with the whole air of his physiognomy. In the head and face
every organ and lineament expressive of brutal and unhesitating violence
was in a state of the highest possible development. Indeed, could our
readers fancy a bulldog come unto mans estate, and walking about in
a hat and coat, they would have no unapt idea of the general style and
effect of his physique. He was accompanied by a travelling companion,
in many respects an exact contrast to himself. He was short and slender,
lithe and catlike in his motions, and had a peering, mousing expression
about his keen black eyes, with which every feature of his face seemed
sharpened into sympathy his thin, long nose, ran out as if it was eager
to bore into the nature of things in general his sleek, thin, black
hair was stuck eagerly forward, and all his motions and evolutions
expressed a dry, cautious acuteness. The great man poured out a big
tumbler half full of raw spirits, and gulped it down without a word. The
little man stood tiptoe, and putting his head first to one side and then
the other, and snuffing considerately in the directions of the various
bottles, ordered at last a mint julep, in a thin and quivering voice,
and with an air of great circumspection. When poured out, he took it and
looked at it with a sharp, complacent air, like a man who thinks he has
done about the right thing, and hit the nail on the head, and proceeded
to dispose of it in short and welladvised sips.
 
"Wal, now, whod a thought this yer luck ad come to me? Why, Loker, how
are ye?" said Haley, coming forward, and extending his hand to the big
man.
 
"The devil!" was the civil reply. "What brought you here, Haley?"
 
The mousing man, who bore the name of Marks, instantly stopped his
sipping, and, poking his head forward, looked shrewdly on the new
acquaintance, as a cat sometimes looks at a moving dry leaf, or some
other possible object of pursuit.
 
"I say, Tom, this yers the luckiest thing in the world. Im in a devil
of a hobble, and you must help me out."
 
"Ugh? aw! like enough!" grunted his complacent acquaintance. "A body may
be pretty sure of that, when _youre_ glad to see em something to be
made off of em. Whats the blow now?"
 
"Youve got a friend here?" said Haley, looking doubtfully at Marks
"partner, perhaps?"
 
"Yes, I have. Here, Marks! heres that ar feller that I was in with in
Natchez."
 
"Shall be pleased with his acquaintance," said Marks, thrusting out a
long, thin hand, like a ravens claw. "Mr. Haley, I believe?"
 
"The same, sir," said Haley. "And now, gentlemen, seein as weve met so
happily, I think Ill stand up to a small matter of a treat in this here
parlor. So, now, old coon," said he to the man at the bar, "get us hot
water, and sugar, and cigars, and plenty of the _real stuff_ and well
have a blowout."
 
Behold, then, the candles lighted, the fire stimulated to the burning
point in the grate, and our three worthies seated round a table, well
spread with all the accessories to good fellowship enumerated before.
 
Haley began a pathetic recital of his peculiar troubles. Loker shut up
his mouth, and listened to him with gruff and surly attention. Marks,
who was anxiously and with much fidgeting compounding a tumbler of punch
to his own peculiar taste, occasionally looked up from his employment,
and, poking his sharp nose and chin almost into Haleys face, gave the
most earnest heed to the whole narrative. The conclusion of it appeared
to amuse him extremely, for he shook his shoulders and sides in silence,
and perked up his thin lips with an air of great internal enjoyment.
 
"So, then, yer fairly sewed up, ant ye?" he said "he! he! he! Its
neatly done, too."
 
"This yer youngun business makes lots of trouble in the trade," said
Haley, dolefully.
 
"If we could get a breed of gals that didnt care, now, for their young
uns," said Marks "tell ye, I think t would be bout the greatest
modrn improvement I knows on,"and Marks patronized his joke by a
quiet introductory sniggle.
 
"Jes so," said Haley "I never couldnt see into it young uns is heaps
of trouble to em one would think, now, theyd be glad to get clar on
em but they arnt. And the more trouble a young un is, and the more
good for nothing, as a genl thing, the tighter they sticks to em."
 
"Wal, Mr. Haley," said Marks, "est pass the hot water. Yes, sir, you
say est what I feel and allus have. Now, I bought a gal once, when
I was in the trade,a tight, likely wench she was, too, and quite
considerable smart,and she had a young un that was misable sickly it
had a crooked back, or something or other and I jest gin t away to
a man that thought hed take his chance raising on t, being it didnt
cost nothinnever thought, yer know, of the gals takin on about
it,but, Lord, yer oughter seen how she went on. Why, relly, she did
seem to me to valley the child more cause _t was_ sickly and cross,
and plagued her and she warnt making blieve, neither,cried about
it, she did, and lopped round, as if shed lost every friend she had.
It relly was droll to think on t. Lord, there aint no end to womens
notions."
 
"Wal, jest so with me," said Haley. "Last summer, down on Red River, I
got a gal traded off on me, with a likely lookin child enough, and his
eyes looked as bright as yourn but, come to look, I found him stone
blind. Facthe was stone blind. Wal, ye see, I thought there warnt no
harm in my jest passing him along, and not sayin nothin and Id got
him nicely swapped off for a keg o whiskey but come to get him away
from the gal, she was jest like a tiger. So t was before we started,
and I hadnt got my gang chained up so what should she do but ups on
a cottonbale, like a cat, ketches a knife from one of the deck hands,
and, I tell ye, she made all fly for a minit, till she saw t want no
use and she jest turns round, and pitches head first, young un and all,
into the river,went down plump, and never ris."
 
"Bah!" said Tom Loker, who had listened to these stories with
illrepressed disgust,"shifless, both on ye! _my_ gals dont cut up
no such shines, I tell ye!"
 
"Indeed! how do you help it?" said Marks, briskly.
 
"Help it? why, I buys a gal, and if shes got a young un to be sold, I
jest walks up and puts my fist to her face, and says, Look here, now,
if you give me one word out of your head, Ill smash yer face in. I
wont hear one wordnot the beginning of a word. I says to em, This
yer young uns mine, and not yourn, and youve no kind o business with
it. Im going to sell it, first chance mind, you dont cut up none o
yer shines about it, or Ill make ye wish yed never been born. I tell
ye, they sees it ant no play, when I gets hold. I makes em as whist as
fishes and if one on em begins and gives a yelp, why," and Mr. Loker
brought down his fist with a thump that fully explained the hiatus.
 
"That ars what ye may call _emphasis_," said Marks, poking Haley in the
side, and going into another small giggle. "Ant Tom peculiar? he! he! I
say, Tom, I spect you make em _understand_, for all niggers heads is
woolly. They dont never have no doubt o your meaning, Tom. If you ant
the devil, Tom, you s his twin brother, Ill say that for ye!"
 
Tom received the compliment with becoming modesty, and began to look
as affable as was consistent, as John Bunyan says, "with his doggish
nature."
 
Haley, who had been imbibing very freely of the staple of the evening,
began to feel a sensible elevation and enlargement of his moral
faculties,a phenomenon not unusual with gentlemen of a serious and
reflective turn, under similar circumstances.
 
"Wal, now, Tom," he said, "ye relly is too bad, as I alays have told
ye ye know, Tom, you and I used to talk over these yer matters down in
Natchez, and I used to prove to ye that we made full as much, and was as
well off for this yer world, by treatin on em well, besides keepin
a better chance for comin in the kingdom at last, when wust comes to
wust, and thar ant nothing else left to get, ye know."
 
"Boh!" said Tom, "_dont_ I know?dont make me too sick with any yer
stuff,my stomach is a leetle riled now" and Tom drank half a glass of
raw brandy.
 
"I say," said Haley, and leaning back in his chair and gesturing
impressively, "Ill say this now, I alays meant to drive my trade so as
to make money on t _fust and foremost_, as much as any man but, then,
trade ant everything, and money ant everything, cause we s all got
souls. I dont care, now, who hears me say it,and I think a cussed
sight on it,so I may as well come out with it. I blieve in religion,
and one of these days, when Ive got matters tight and snug, I
calculates to tend to my soul and them ar matters and so whats the use
of doin any more wickedness than s relly necessary?it dont seem to
me its t all prudent."
 
"Tend to yer soul!" repeated Tom, contemptuously "take a bright lookout
to find a soul in you,save yourself any care on that score. If the
devil sifts you through a hair sieve, he wont find one."
 
"Why, Tom, youre cross," said Haley "why cant ye take it pleasant,
now, when a fellers talking for your good?"
 
"Stop that ar jaw o yourn, there," said Tom, gruffly. "I can stand most
any talk o yourn but your pious talk,that kills me right up. After
all, whats the odds between me and you? Tant that you care one bit
more, or have a bit more feelinits clean, sheer, dog meanness,
wanting to cheat the devil and save your own skin dont I see through
it? And your gettin religion, as you call it, arter all, is too
pisin mean for any critturrun up a bill with the devil all your
life, and then sneak out when pay time comes! Bob!"
 
"Come, come, gentlemen, I say this isnt business," said Marks.
"Theres different ways, you know, of looking at all subjects. Mr. Haley
is a very nice man, no doubt, and has his own conscience and, Tom, you
have your ways, and very good ones, too, Tom but quarrelling, you know,
wont answer no kind of purpose. Lets go to business. Now, Mr. Haley,
what is it?you want us to undertake to catch this yer gal?"
 
"The gals no matter of mine,shes Shelbys its only the boy. I was
a fool for buying the monkey!"
 
"Youre generally a fool!" said Tom, gruffly.
 
"Come, now, Loker, none of your huffs," said Marks, licking his lips
"you see, Mr. Haley s a puttin us in a way of a good job, I reckon
just hold stillthese yer arrangements is my forte. This yer gal, Mr.
Haley, how is she? what is she?"
 
"Wal! white and handsomewell brought up. Id a gin Shelby eight
hundred or a thousand, and then made well on her."
 
"White and handsomewell brought up!" said Marks, his sharp eyes,
nose and mouth, all alive with enterprise. "Look here, now, Loker, a
beautiful opening. Well do a business here on our own accountwe does
the catchin the boy, of course, goes to Mr. Haley,we takes the gal
to Orleans to speculate on. Ant it beautiful?"
 
Tom, whose great heavy mouth had stood ajar during this communication,
now suddenly snapped it together, as a big dog closes on a piece of
meat, and seemed to be digesting the idea at his leisure.
 
"Ye see," said Marks to Haley, stirring his punch as he did so, "ye see,
we has justices convenient at all pints along shore, that does up any
little jobs in our line quite reasonable. Tom, he does the knockin down
and that ar and I come in all dressed upshining bootseverything
first chop, when the swearin s to be done. You oughter see, now," said
Marks, in a glow of professional pride, "how I can tone it off. One day,
Im Mr. Twickem, from New Orleans nother day, Im just come from my
plantation on Pearl River, where I works seven hundred niggers then,
again, I come out a distant relation of Henry Clay, or some old cock in
Kentuck. Talents is different, you know. Now, Toms roarer when theres
any thumping or fighting to be done but at lying he ant good, Tom
ant,ye see it dont come natural to him but, Lord, if thars a
feller in the country that can swear to anything and everything, and put
in all the circumstances and flourishes with a long face, and carry t
through better n I can, why, Id like to see him, thats all! I blieve
my heart, I could get along and snake through, even if justices were
more particular than they is. Sometimes I rather wish they was more
particular t would be a heap more relishin if they was,more fun,
yer know."
 
Tom Loker, who, as we have made it appear, was a man of slow thoughts
and movements, here interrupted Marks by bringing his heavy fist down on
the table, so as to make all ring again, _"Itll do!"_ he said.
 
"Lord bless ye, Tom, ye neednt break all the glasses!" said Marks
"save your fist for time o need."
 
"But, gentlemen, ant I to come in for a share of the profits?" said
Haley.
 
"Ant it enough we catch the boy for ye?" said Loker. "What do ye want?"
 
"Wal," said Haley, "if I gives you the job, its worth something,say
ten per cent. on the profits, expenses paid."
 
"Now," said Loker, with a tremendous oath, and striking the table with
his heavy fist, "dont I know _you_, Dan Haley? Dont you think to come
it over me! Suppose Marks and I have taken up the catchin trade, jest
to commodate gentlemen like you, and get nothin for ourselves?Not by
a long chalk! well have the gal out and out, and you keep quiet, or, ye
see, well have both,whats to hinder? Hant you showd us the game?
Its as free to us as you, I hope. If you or Shelby wants to chase us,
look where the partridges was last year if you find them or us, youre
quite welcome."
 
"O, wal, certainly, jest let it go at that," said Haley, alarmed "you
catch the boy for the jobyou allers did trade _far_ with me, Tom, and
was up to yer word."
 
"Ye know that," said Tom "I dont pretend none of your snivelling ways,
but I wont lie in my counts with the devil himself. What I ses Ill
do, I will do,you know _that_, Dan Haley."
 
"Jes so, jes so,I said so, Tom," said Haley "and if youd only
promise to have the boy for me in a week, at any point youll name,
thats all I want."
 
"But it ant all I want, by a long jump," said Tom. "Ye dont think I
did business with you, down in Natchez, for nothing, Haley Ive learned
to hold an eel, when I catch him. Youve got to fork over fifty dollars,
flat down, or this child dont start a peg. I know yer."
 
"Why, when you have a job in hand that may bring a clean profit
of somewhere about a thousand or sixteen hundred, why, Tom, youre
onreasonable," said Haley.
 
"Yes, and hasnt we business booked for five weeks to come,all we can
do? And suppose we leaves all, and goes to bushwhacking round arter yer
young uns, and finally doesnt catch the gal,and gals allers is the
devil _to_ catch,whats then? would you pay us a centwould you? I
think I see you a doin itugh! No, no flap down your fifty. If we
get the job, and it pays, Ill hand it back if we dont, its for our
trouble,thats _far_, ant it, Marks?"
 
"Certainly, certainly," said Marks, with a conciliatory tone "its only
a retaining fee, you see,he! he! he!we lawyers, you know. Wal, we
must all keep goodnatured,keep easy, yer know. Tomll have the boy
for yer, anywhere yell name wont ye, Tom?"
 
"If I find the young un, Ill bring him on to Cincinnati, and leave him
at Granny Belchers, on the landing," said Loker.
 
Marks had got from his pocket a greasy pocketbook, and taking a long
paper from thence, he sat down, and fixing his keen black eyes on it,
began mumbling over its contents "BarnesShelby Countyboy Jim, three
hundred dollars for him, dead or alive.
 
"EdwardsDick and Lucyman and wife, six hundred dollars wench Polly
and two childrensix hundred for her or her head.
 
"Im jest a runnin over our business, to see if we can take up this yer
handily. Loker," he said, after a pause, "we must set Adams and Springer
on the track of these yer theyve been booked some time."
 
"Theyll charge too much," said Tom.
 
"Ill manage that ar they s young in the business, and must spect to
work cheap," said Marks, as he continued to read. "Thers three on em
easy cases, cause all youve got to do is to shoot em, or swear they
is shot they couldnt, of course, charge much for that. Them other
cases," he said, folding the paper, "will bear puttin off a spell. So
now lets come to the particulars. Now, Mr. Haley, you saw this yer gal
when she landed?"
 
"To be sure,plain as I see you."
 
"And a man helpin on her up the bank?" said Loker.
 
"To be sure, I did."
 
"Most likely," said Marks, "shes took in somewhere but where, s a
question. Tom, what do you say?"
 
"We must cross the river tonight, no mistake," said Tom.
 
"But theres no boat about," said Marks. "The ice is running awfully,
Tom ant it dangerous?"
 
"Donno nothing bout that,only its got to be done," said Tom,
decidedly.
 
"Dear me," said Marks, fidgeting, "itll beI say," he said, walking to
the window, "its dark as a wolfs mouth, and, Tom"
 
"The long and short is, youre scared, Marks but I cant help
that,youve got to go. Suppose you want to lie by a day or two, till
the gal s been carried on the underground line up to Sandusky or so,
before you start."
 
"O, no I ant a grain afraid," said Marks, "only"
 
"Only what?" said Tom.
 
"Well, about the boat. Yer see there ant any boat."
 
"I heard the woman say there was one coming along this evening, and that
a man was going to cross over in it. Neck or nothing, we must go with
him," said Tom.
 
"I spose youve got good dogs," said Haley.
 
"First rate," said Marks. "But whats the use? you hant got nothin o
hers to smell on."
 
"Yes, I have," said Haley, triumphantly. "Heres her shawl she left on
the bed in her hurry she left her bonnet, too."
 
"That ars lucky," said Loker "fork over."
 
"Though the dogs might damage the gal, if they come on her unawars,"
said Haley.
 
"That ars a consideration," said Marks. "Our dogs tore a feller half to
pieces, once, down in Mobile, fore we could get em off."
 
"Well, ye see, for this sort thats to be sold for their looks, that ar
wont answer, ye see," said Haley.
 
"I do see," said Marks. "Besides, if shes got took in, tant no go,
neither. Dogs is no count in these yer up states where these critters
gets carried of course, ye cant get on their track. They only does
down in plantations, where niggers, when they runs, has to do their own
running, and dont get no help."
 
"Well," said Loker, who had just stepped out to the bar to make some
inquiries, "they say the mans come with the boat so, Marks"
 
That worthy cast a rueful look at the comfortable quarters he was
leaving, but slowly rose to obey. After exchanging a few words of
further arrangement, Haley, with visible reluctance, handed over the
fifty dollars to Tom, and the worthy trio separated for the night.
 
If any of our refined and Christian readers object to the society into
which this scene introduces them, let us beg them to begin and conquer
their prejudices in time. The catching business, we beg to remind them,
is rising to the dignity of a lawful and patriotic profession. If all
the broad land between the Mississippi and the Pacific becomes one great
market for bodies and souls, and human property retains the locomotive
tendencies of this nineteenth century, the trader and catcher may yet be
among our aristocracy.
 
 
While this scene was going on at the tavern, Sam and Andy, in a state of
high felicitation, pursued their way home.
 
Sam was in the highest possible feather, and expressed his exultation by
all sorts of supernatural howls and ejaculations, by divers odd motions
and contortions of his whole system. Sometimes he would sit backward,
with his face to the horses tail and sides, and then, with a whoop and
a somerset, come right side up in his place again, and, drawing on a
grave face, begin to lecture Andy in highsounding tones for laughing
and playing the fool. Anon, slapping his sides with his arms, he would
burst forth in peals of laughter, that made the old woods ring as they
passed. With all these evolutions, he contrived to keep the horses up
to the top of their speed, until, between ten and eleven, their heels
resounded on the gravel at the end of the balcony. Mrs. Shelby flew to
the railings.
 
"Is that you, Sam? Where are they?"
 
"Masr Haley s arestin at the tavern hes drefful fatigued, Missis."
 
"And Eliza, Sam?"
 
"Wal, shes clar cross Jordan. As a body may say, in the land o
Canaan."
 
"Why, Sam, what _do_ you mean?" said Mrs. Shelby, breathless, and almost
faint, as the possible meaning of these words came over her.
 
"Wal, Missis, de Lord he persarves his own. Lizys done gone over the
river into Hio, as markably as if de Lord took her over in a charrit
of fire and two hosses."
 
Sams vein of piety was always uncommonly fervent in his mistress
presence and he made great capital of scriptural figures and images.
 
"Come up here, Sam," said Mr. Shelby, who had followed on to the
verandah, "and tell your mistress what she wants. Come, come, Emily,"
said he, passing his arm round her, "you are cold and all in a shiver
you allow yourself to feel too much."
 
"Feel too much! Am not I a woman,a mother? Are we not both responsible
to God for this poor girl? My God! lay not this sin to our charge."
 
"What sin, Emily? You see yourself that we have only done what we were
obliged to."
 
"Theres an awful feeling of guilt about it, though," said Mrs. Shelby.
"I cant reason it away."
 
"Here, Andy, you nigger, be alive!" called Sam, under the verandah
"take these yer hosses to der barn dont ye hear Masr a callin?" and
Sam soon appeared, palmleaf in hand, at the parlor door.
 
"Now, Sam, tell us distinctly how the matter was," said Mr. Shelby.
"Where is Eliza, if you know?"
 
"Wal, Masr, I saw her, with my own eyes, a crossin on the floatin
ice. She crossed most markably it wasnt no less nor a miracle and I
saw a man help her up the Hio side, and then she was lost in the dusk."
 
"Sam, I think this rather apocryphal,this miracle. Crossing on
floating ice isnt so easily done," said Mr. Shelby.
 
"Easy! couldnt nobody a done it, without de Lord. Why, now," said Sam,
"t was jist dis yer way. Masr Haley, and me, and Andy, we comes up
to de little tavern by the river, and I rides a leetle ahead,Is so
zealous to be a cotchin Lizy, that I couldnt hold in, no way,and
when I comes by the tavern winder, sure enough there she was, right in
plain sight, and dey diggin on behind. Wal, I loses off my hat, and
sings out nuff to raise the dead. Course Lizy she hars, and she dodges
back, when Masr Haley he goes past the door and then, I tell ye, she
clared out de side door she went down de river bankMasr Haley he
seed her, and yelled out, and him, and me, and Andy, we took arter. Down
she come to the river, and thar was the current running ten feet wide
by the shore, and over t other side ice a sawin and a jiggling up and
down, kinder as t were a great island. We come right behind her, and I
thought my soul hed got her sure enough,when she gin sich a screech
as I never hearn, and thar she was, clar over t other side of
the current, on the ice, and then on she went, a screeching and a
jumpin,the ice went crack! cwallop! cracking! chunk! and she a
boundin like a buck! Lord, the spring that ar gals got in her ant
common, Im o pinion."
 
Mrs. Shelby sat perfectly silent, pale with excitement, while Sam told
his story.
 
"God be praised, she isnt dead!" she said "but where is the poor child
now?"
 
"De Lord will pervide," said Sam, rolling up his eyes piously. "As Ive
been a sayin, dis yer s a providence and no mistake, as Missis has
allers been a instructin on us. Thars allers instruments ris up to do
de Lords will. Now, if t hadnt been for me today, shed a been took
a dozen times. Warnt it I started off de hosses, dis yer mornin and
kept em chasin till nigh dinner time? And didnt I car Masr Haley
night five miles out of de road, dis evening, or else hed a come up
with Lizy as easy as a dog arter a coon. These yer s all providences."
 
"They are a kind of providences that youll have to be pretty sparing
of, Master Sam. I allow no such practices with gentlemen on my place,"
said Mr. Shelby, with as much sternness as he could command, under the
circumstances.
 
Now, there is no more use in making believe be angry with a negro than
with a child both instinctively see the true state of the case, through
all attempts to affect the contrary and Sam was in no wise disheartened
by this rebuke, though he assumed an air of doleful gravity, and stood
with the corners of his mouth lowered in most penitential style.
 
"Masr quite right,quite it was ugly on me,theres no disputin
that ar and of course Masr and Missis wouldnt encourage no such
works. Im sensible of dat ar but a poor nigger like me s mazin
tempted to act ugly sometimes, when fellers will cut up such shines as
dat ar Masr Haley he ant no genlman no way anybodys been raised
as Ive been cant help a seein dat ar."
 
"Well, Sam," said Mrs. Shelby, "as you appear to have a proper sense of
your errors, you may go now and tell Aunt Chloe she may get you some
of that cold ham that was left of dinner today. You and Andy must be
hungry."
 
"Missis is a heap too good for us," said Sam, making his bow with
alacrity, and departing.
 
It will be perceived, as has been before intimated, that Master Sam had
a native talent that might, undoubtedly, have raised him to eminence
in political life,a talent of making capital out of everything that
turned up, to be invested for his own especial praise and glory
and having done up his piety and humility, as he trusted, to the
satisfaction of the parlor, he clapped his palmleaf on his head, with
a sort of rakish, freeandeasy air, and proceeded to the dominions of
Aunt Chloe, with the intention of flourishing largely in the kitchen.
 
"Ill speechify these yer niggers," said Sam to himself, "now Ive got a
chance. Lord, Ill reel it off to make em stare!"
 
It must be observed that one of Sams especial delights had been to ride
in attendance on his master to all kinds of political gatherings, where,
roosted on some rail fence, or perched aloft in some tree, he would
sit watching the orators, with the greatest apparent gusto, and then,
descending among the various brethren of his own color, assembled on
the same errand, he would edify and delight them with the most ludicrous
burlesques and imitations, all delivered with the most imperturbable
earnestness and solemnity and though the auditors immediately about him
were generally of his own color, it not infrequently happened that
they were fringed pretty deeply with those of a fairer complexion, who
listened, laughing and winking, to Sams great selfcongratulation.
In fact, Sam considered oratory as his vocation, and never let slip an
opportunity of magnifying his office.
 
Now, between Sam and Aunt Chloe there had existed, from ancient times,
a sort of chronic feud, or rather a decided coolness but, as Sam was
meditating something in the provision department, as the necessary and
obvious foundation of his operations, he determined, on the present
occasion, to be eminently conciliatory for he well knew that although
"Missis orders" would undoubtedly be followed to the letter, yet
he should gain a considerable deal by enlisting the spirit also. He
therefore appeared before Aunt Chloe with a touchingly subdued, resigned
expression, like one who has suffered immeasurable hardships in behalf
of a persecuted fellowcreature,enlarged upon the fact that Missis had
directed him to come to Aunt Chloe for whatever might be wanting to
make up the balance in his solids and fluids,and thus unequivocally
acknowledged her right and supremacy in the cooking department, and all
thereto pertaining.
 
The thing took accordingly. No poor, simple, virtuous body was ever
cajoled by the attentions of an electioneering politician with more ease
than Aunt Chloe was won over by Master Sams suavities and if he had
been the prodigal son himself, he could not have been overwhelmed with
more maternal bountifulness and he soon found himself seated, happy and
glorious, over a large tin pan, containing a sort of _olla podrida_ of
all that had appeared on the table for two or three days past. Savory
morsels of ham, golden blocks of corncake, fragments of pie of
every conceivable mathematical figure, chicken wings, gizzards, and
drumsticks, all appeared in picturesque confusion and Sam, as monarch
of all he surveyed, sat with his palmleaf cocked rejoicingly to one
side, and patronizing Andy at his right hand.
 
The kitchen was full of all his compeers, who had hurried and crowded
in, from the various cabins, to hear the termination of the days
exploits. Now was Sams hour of glory. The story of the day was
rehearsed, with all kinds of ornament and varnishing which might be
necessary to heighten its effect for Sam, like some of our fashionable
dilettanti, never allowed a story to lose any of its gilding by passing
through his hands. Roars of laughter attended the narration, and were
taken up and prolonged by all the smaller fry, who were lying, in any
quantity, about on the floor, or perched in every corner. In the
height of the uproar and laughter, Sam, however, preserved an immovable
gravity, only from time to time rolling his eyes up, and giving his
auditors divers inexpressibly droll glances, without departing from the
sententious elevation of his oratory.
 
"Yer see, fellowcountrymen," said Sam, elevating a turkeys leg, with
energy, "yer see, now what dis yer chile s up ter, for fendin yer
all,yes, all on yer. For him as tries to get one o our people is as
good as tryin to get all yer see the principle s de same,dat ars
clar. And any one o these yer drivers that comes smelling round arter
any our people, why, hes got _me_ in his way _Im_ the feller hes got
to set in with,Im the feller for yer all to come to, bredren,Ill
stand up for yer rights,Ill fend em to the last breath!"
 
"Why, but Sam, yer telled me, only this mornin, that youd help this
yer Masr to cotch Lizy seems to me yer talk dont hang together," said
Andy.
 
"I tell you now, Andy," said Sam, with awful superiority, "dont yer
be a talkin bout what yer dont know nothin on boys like you,
Andy, means well, but they cant be spected to collusitate the great
principles of action."
 
Andy looked rebuked, particularly by the hard word collusitate, which
most of the youngerly members of the company seemed to consider as a
settler in the case, while Sam proceeded.
 
"Dat ar was _conscience_, Andy when I thought of gwine arter Lizy, I
railly spected Masr was sot dat way. When I found Missis was sot the
contrar, dat ar was conscience _more yet_,cause fellers allers gets
more by stickin to Missis side,so yer see I s persistent either
way, and sticks up to conscience, and holds on to principles. Yes,
_principles_," said Sam, giving an enthusiastic toss to a chickens
neck,"whats principles good for, if we isnt persistent, I wanter
know? Thar, Andy, you may have dat ar bone,tant picked quite clean."
 
Sams audience hanging on his words with open mouth, he could not but
proceed.
 
"Dis yer matter bout persistence, fellerniggers," said Sam, with the
air of one entering into an abstruse subject, "dis yer sistency s a
thing what ant seed into very clar, by most anybody. Now, yer see, when
a feller stands up for a thing one day and night, de contrar de next,
folks ses and natrally enough dey ses, why he ant persistent,hand
me dat ar bit o corncake, Andy. But lets look inter it. I hope
the genlmen and der fair sex will scuse my usin an ornary sort o
parison. Here! Im a trying to get top o der hay. Wal, I puts up my
larder dis yer side tant no goden, cause I dont try dere no
more, but puts my larder right de contrar side, ant I persistent? Im
persistent in wantin to get up which ary side my larder is dont you
see, all on yer?"
 
"Its the only thing ye ever was persistent in, Lord knows!" muttered
Aunt Chloe, who was getting rather restive the merriment of the evening
being to her somewhat after the Scripture comparison,like "vinegar
upon nitre."
 
"Yes, indeed!" said Sam, rising, full of supper and glory, for a closing
effort. "Yes, my fellercitizens and ladies of de other sex in general,
I has principles,Im proud to oon em,they s perquisite to dese
yer times, and ter _all_ times. I has principles, and I sticks to em
like forty,jest anything that I thinks is principle, I goes in to
tI wouldnt mind if dey burnt me live,Id walk right up to de
stake, I would, and say, here I comes to shed my last blood fur my
principles, fur my country, fur de genl interests of society."
 
"Well," said Aunt Chloe, "one o yer principles will have to be to
get to bed some time tonight, and not be a keepin everybody up till
mornin now, every one of you young uns that dont want to be cracked,
had better be scase, mighty sudden."
 
"Niggers! all on yer," said Sam, waving his palmleaf with benignity, "I
give yer my blessin go to bed now, and be good boys."
 
And, with this pathetic benediction, the assembly dispersed.
 
 
 
CHAPTER IX
 
In Which It Appears That a Senator Is But a Man
 
 
The light of the cheerful fire shone on the rug and carpet of a cosey
parlor, and glittered on the sides of the teacups and wellbrightened
teapot, as Senator Bird was drawing off his boots, preparatory to
inserting his feet in a pair of new handsome slippers, which his wife
had been working for him while away on his senatorial tour. Mrs. Bird,
looking the very picture of delight, was superintending the arrangements
of the table, ever and anon mingling admonitory remarks to a number of
frolicsome juveniles, who were effervescing in all those modes of untold
gambol and mischief that have astonished mothers ever since the flood.
 
"Tom, let the doorknob alone,theres a man! Mary! Mary! dont pull
the cats tail,poor pussy! Jim, you mustnt climb on that table,no,
no!You dont know, my dear, what a surprise it is to us all, to see
you here tonight!" said she, at last, when she found a space to say
something to her husband.
 
"Yes, yes, I thought Id just make a run down, spend the night, and have
a little comfort at home. Im tired to death, and my head aches!"
 
Mrs. Bird cast a glance at a camphorbottle, which stood in the
halfopen closet, and appeared to meditate an approach to it, but her
husband interposed.
 
"No, no, Mary, no doctoring! a cup of your good hot tea, and some of
our good home living, is what I want. Its a tiresome business, this
legislating!"
 
And the senator smiled, as if he rather liked the idea of considering
himself a sacrifice to his country.
 
"Well," said his wife, after the business of the teatable was getting
rather slack, "and what have they been doing in the Senate?"
 
Now, it was a very unusual thing for gentle little Mrs. Bird ever to
trouble her head with what was going on in the house of the state, very
wisely considering that she had enough to do to mind her own. Mr. Bird,
therefore, opened his eyes in surprise, and said,
 
"Not very much of importance."
 
"Well but is it true that they have been passing a law forbidding
people to give meat and drink to those poor colored folks that come
along? I heard they were talking of some such law, but I didnt think
any Christian legislature would pass it!"
 
"Why, Mary, you are getting to be a politician, all at once."
 
"No, nonsense! I wouldnt give a fig for all your politics, generally,
but I think this is something downright cruel and unchristian. I hope,
my dear, no such law has been passed."
 
"There has been a law passed forbidding people to help off the slaves
that come over from Kentucky, my dear so much of that thing has been
done by these reckless Abolitionists, that our brethren in Kentucky
are very strongly excited, and it seems necessary, and no more than
Christian and kind, that something should be done by our state to quiet
the excitement."
 
"And what is the law? It dont forbid us to shelter those poor creatures
a night, does it, and to give em something comfortable to eat, and a
few old clothes, and send them quietly about their business?"
 
"Why, yes, my dear that would be aiding and abetting, you know."
 
Mrs. Bird was a timid, blushing little woman, of about four feet in
height, and with mild blue eyes, and a peachblow complexion, and the
gentlest, sweetest voice in the worldas for courage, a moderatesized
cockturkey had been known to put her to rout at the very first gobble,
and a stout housedog, of moderate capacity, would bring her into
subjection merely by a show of his teeth. Her husband and children were
her entire world, and in these she ruled more by entreaty and persuasion
than by command or argument. There was only one thing that was capable
of arousing her, and that provocation came in on the side of her
unusually gentle and sympathetic natureanything in the shape of
cruelty would throw her into a passion, which was the more alarming
and inexplicable in proportion to the general softness of her nature.
Generally the most indulgent and easy to be entreated of all mothers,
still her boys had a very reverent remembrance of a most vehement
chastisement she once bestowed on them, because she found them leagued
with several graceless boys of the neighborhood, stoning a defenceless
kitten.
 
"Ill tell you what," Master Bill used to say, "I was scared that time.
Mother came at me so that I thought she was crazy, and I was whipped
and tumbled off to bed, without any supper, before I could get over
wondering what had come about and, after that, I heard mother crying
outside the door, which made me feel worse than all the rest. Ill tell
you what," hed say, "we boys never stoned another kitten!"
 
On the present occasion, Mrs. Bird rose quickly, with very red cheeks,
which quite improved her general appearance, and walked up to her
husband, with quite a resolute air, and said, in a determined tone,
 
"Now, John, I want to know if you think such a law as that is right and
Christian?"
 
"You wont shoot me, now, Mary, if I say I do!"
 
"I never could have thought it of you, John you didnt vote for it?"
 
"Even so, my fair politician."
 
"You ought to be ashamed, John! Poor, homeless, houseless creatures!
Its a shameful, wicked, abominable law, and Ill break it, for one,
the first time I get a chance and I hope I _shall_ have a chance, I do!
Things have got to a pretty pass, if a woman cant give a warm supper
and a bed to poor, starving creatures, just because they are slaves, and
have been abused and oppressed all their lives, poor things!"
 
"But, Mary, just listen to me. Your feelings are all quite right, dear,
and interesting, and I love you for them but, then, dear, we mustnt
suffer our feelings to run away with our judgment you must consider
its a matter of private feeling,there are great public interests
involved,there is such a state of public agitation rising, that we
must put aside our private feelings."
 
"Now, John, I dont know anything about politics, but I can read my
Bible and there I see that I must feed the hungry, clothe the naked,
and comfort the desolate and that Bible I mean to follow."
 
"But in cases where your doing so would involve a great public evil"
 
"Obeying God never brings on public evils. I know it cant. Its always
safest, all round, to _do as He_ bids us.
 
"Now, listen to me, Mary, and I can state to you a very clear argument,
to show"
 
"O, nonsense, John! you can talk all night, but you wouldnt do it.
I put it to you, John,would _you_ now turn away a poor, shivering,
hungry creature from your door, because he was a runaway? _Would_ you,
now?"
 
Now, if the truth must be told, our senator had the misfortune to be
a man who had a particularly humane and accessible nature, and turning
away anybody that was in trouble never had been his forte and what was
worse for him in this particular pinch of the argument was, that
his wife knew it, and, of course was making an assault on rather an
indefensible point. So he had recourse to the usual means of gaining
time for such cases made and provided he said "ahem," and coughed
several times, took out his pockethandkerchief, and began to wipe his
glasses. Mrs. Bird, seeing the defenceless condition of the enemys
territory, had no more conscience than to push her advantage.
 
"I should like to see you doing that, JohnI really should! Turning a
woman out of doors in a snowstorm, for instance or may be youd take
her up and put her in jail, wouldnt you? You would make a great hand at
that!"
 
"Of course, it would be a very painful duty," began Mr. Bird, in a
moderate tone.
 
"Duty, John! dont use that word! You know it isnt a dutyit cant be
a duty! If folks want to keep their slaves from running away, let em
treat em well,thats my doctrine. If I had slaves as I hope I never
shall have, Id risk their wanting to run away from me, or you either,
John. I tell you folks dont run away when they are happy and when
they do run, poor creatures! they suffer enough with cold and hunger and
fear, without everybodys turning against them and, law or no law, I
never will, so help me God!"
 
"Mary! Mary! My dear, let me reason with you."
 
"I hate reasoning, John,especially reasoning on such subjects. Theres
a way you political folks have of coming round and round a plain
right thing and you dont believe in it yourselves, when it comes to
practice. I know _you_ well enough, John. You dont believe its right
any more than I do and you wouldnt do it any sooner than I."
 
At this critical juncture, old Cudjoe, the black manofallwork,
put his head in at the door, and wished "Missis would come into the
kitchen" and our senator, tolerably relieved, looked after his little
wife with a whimsical mixture of amusement and vexation, and, seating
himself in the armchair, began to read the papers.
 
After a moment, his wifes voice was heard at the door, in a quick,
earnest tone,"John! John! I do wish youd come here, a moment."
 
He laid down his paper, and went into the kitchen, and started, quite
amazed at the sight that presented itselfA young and slender woman,
with garments torn and frozen, with one shoe gone, and the stocking torn
away from the cut and bleeding foot, was laid back in a deadly swoon
upon two chairs. There was the impress of the despised race on her face,
yet none could help feeling its mournful and pathetic beauty, while its
stony sharpness, its cold, fixed, deathly aspect, struck a solemn chill
over him. He drew his breath short, and stood in silence. His wife,
and their only colored domestic, old Aunt Dinah, were busily engaged in
restorative measures while old Cudjoe had got the boy on his knee, and
was busy pulling off his shoes and stockings, and chafing his little
cold feet.
 
"Sure, now, if she ant a sight to behold!" said old Dinah,
compassionately "pears like t was the heat that made her faint.
She was tolable peart when she cum in, and asked if she couldnt warm
herself here a spell and I was just aaskin her where she cum from,
and she fainted right down. Never done much hard work, guess, by the
looks of her hands."
 
"Poor creature!" said Mrs. Bird, compassionately, as the woman slowly
unclosed her large, dark eyes, and looked vacantly at her. Suddenly an
expression of agony crossed her face, and she sprang up, saying, "O, my
Harry! Have they got him?"
 
The boy, at this, jumped from Cudjoes knee, and running to her side put
up his arms. "O, hes here! hes here!" she exclaimed.
 
"O, maam!" said she, wildly, to Mrs. Bird, "do protect us! dont let
them get him!"
 
"Nobody shall hurt you here, poor woman," said Mrs. Bird, encouragingly.
"You are safe dont be afraid."
 
"God bless you!" said the woman, covering her face and sobbing while
the little boy, seeing her crying, tried to get into her lap.
 
With many gentle and womanly offices, which none knew better how to
render than Mrs. Bird, the poor woman was, in time, rendered more calm.
A temporary bed was provided for her on the settle, near the fire and,
after a short time, she fell into a heavy slumber, with the child,
who seemed no less weary, soundly sleeping on her arm for the mother
resisted, with nervous anxiety, the kindest attempts to take him from
her and, even in sleep, her arm encircled him with an unrelaxing clasp,
as if she could not even then be beguiled of her vigilant hold.
 
Mr. and Mrs. Bird had gone back to the parlor, where, strange as it
may appear, no reference was made, on either side, to the preceding
conversation but Mrs. Bird busied herself with her knittingwork, and
Mr. Bird pretended to be reading the paper.
 
"I wonder who and what she is!" said Mr. Bird, at last, as he laid it
down.
 
"When she wakes up and feels a little rested, we will see," said Mrs.
Bird.
 
"I say, wife!" said Mr. Bird after musing in silence over his newspaper.
 
"Well, dear!"
 
"She couldnt wear one of your gowns, could she, by any letting down, or
such matter? She seems to be rather larger than you are."
 
A quite perceptible smile glimmered on Mrs. Birds face, as she
answered, "Well see."
 
Another pause, and Mr. Bird again broke out,
 
"I say, wife!"
 
"Well! What now?"
 
"Why, theres that old bombazin cloak, that you keep on purpose to
put over me when I take my afternoons nap you might as well give her
that,she needs clothes."
 
At this instant, Dinah looked in to say that the woman was awake, and
wanted to see Missis.
 
Mr. and Mrs. Bird went into the kitchen, followed by the two eldest
boys, the smaller fry having, by this time, been safely disposed of in
bed.
 
The woman was now sitting up on the settle, by the fire. She was looking
steadily into the blaze, with a calm, heartbroken expression, very
different from her former agitated wildness.
 
"Did you want me?" said Mrs. Bird, in gentle tones. "I hope you feel
better now, poor woman!"
 
A longdrawn, shivering sigh was the only answer but she lifted her
dark eyes, and fixed them on her with such a forlorn and imploring
expression, that the tears came into the little womans eyes.
 
"You neednt be afraid of anything we are friends here, poor woman!
Tell me where you came from, and what you want," said she.
 
"I came from Kentucky," said the woman.
 
"When?" said Mr. Bird, taking up the interogatory.
 
"Tonight."
 
"How did you come?"
 
"I crossed on the ice."
 
"Crossed on the ice!" said every one present.
 
"Yes," said the woman, slowly, "I did. God helping me, I crossed on the
ice for they were behind meright behindand there was no other way!"
 
"Law, Missis," said Cudjoe, "the ice is all in brokenup blocks, a
swinging and a tetering up and down in the water!"
 
"I know it wasI know it!" said she, wildly "but I did it! I wouldnt
have thought I could,I didnt think I should get over, but I didnt
care! I could but die, if I didnt. The Lord helped me nobody knows
how much the Lord can help em, till they try," said the woman, with a
flashing eye.
 
"Were you a slave?" said Mr. Bird.
 
"Yes, sir I belonged to a man in Kentucky."
 
"Was he unkind to you?"
 
"No, sir he was a good master."
 
"And was your mistress unkind to you?"
 
"No, sirno! my mistress was always good to me."
 
"What could induce you to leave a good home, then, and run away, and go
through such dangers?"
 
The woman looked up at Mrs. Bird, with a keen, scrutinizing glance, and
it did not escape her that she was dressed in deep mourning.
 
"Maam," she said, suddenly, "have you ever lost a child?"
 
The question was unexpected, and it was thrust on a new wound for it
was only a month since a darling child of the family had been laid in
the grave.
 
Mr. Bird turned around and walked to the window, and Mrs. Bird burst
into tears but, recovering her voice, she said,
 
"Why do you ask that? I have lost a little one."
 
"Then you will feel for me. I have lost two, one after another,left
em buried there when I came away and I had only this one left. I
never slept a night without him he was all I had. He was my comfort and
pride, day and night and, maam, they were going to take him away from
me,to _sell_ him,sell him down south, maam, to go all alone,a
baby that had never been away from his mother in his life! I couldnt
stand it, maam. I knew I never should be good for anything, if they
did and when I knew the papers the papers were signed, and he was sold,
I took him and came off in the night and they chased me,the man that
bought him, and some of Masrs folks,and they were coming down right
behind me, and I heard em. I jumped right on to the ice and how I got
across, I dont know,but, first I knew, a man was helping me up the
bank."
 
The woman did not sob nor weep. She had gone to a place where tears
are dry but every one around her was, in some way characteristic of
themselves, showing signs of hearty sympathy.
 
The two little boys, after a desperate rummaging in their pockets, in
search of those pockethandkerchiefs which mothers know are never to
be found there, had thrown themselves disconsolately into the skirts of
their mothers gown, where they were sobbing, and wiping their eyes and
noses, to their hearts contentMrs. Bird had her face fairly hidden
in her pockethandkerchief and old Dinah, with tears streaming down her
black, honest face, was ejaculating, "Lord have mercy on us!" with all
the fervor of a campmeetingwhile old Cudjoe, rubbing his eyes very
hard with his cuffs, and making a most uncommon variety of wry faces,
occasionally responded in the same key, with great fervor. Our senator
was a statesman, and of course could not be expected to cry, like other
mortals and so he turned his back to the company, and looked out of the
window, and seemed particularly busy in clearing his throat and wiping
his spectacleglasses, occasionally blowing his nose in a manner that
was calculated to excite suspicion, had any one been in a state to
observe critically.
 
"How came you to tell me you had a kind master?" he suddenly exclaimed,
gulping down very resolutely some kind of rising in his throat, and
turning suddenly round upon the woman.
 
"Because he _was_ a kind master Ill say that of him, any wayand my
mistress was kind but they couldnt help themselves. They were owing
money and there was some way, I cant tell how, that a man had a hold
on them, and they were obliged to give him his will. I listened, and
heard him telling mistress that, and she begging and pleading for
me,and he told her he couldnt help himself, and that the papers were
all drawnand then it was I took him and left my home, and came away.
I knew t was no use of my trying to live, if they did it for t pears
like this child is all I have."
 
"Have you no husband?"
 
"Yes, but he belongs to another man. His master is real hard to him,
and wont let him come to see me, hardly ever and hes grown harder and
harder upon us, and he threatens to sell him down southits like Ill
never see _him_ again!"
 
The quiet tone in which the woman pronounced these words might have led
a superficial observer to think that she was entirely apathetic but
there was a calm, settled depth of anguish in her large, dark eye, that
spoke of something far otherwise.
 
"And where do you mean to go, my poor woman?" said Mrs. Bird.
 
"To Canada, if I only knew where that was. Is it very far off, is
Canada?" said she, looking up, with a simple, confiding air, to Mrs.
Birds face.
 
"Poor thing!" said Mrs. Bird, involuntarily.
 
"Is t a very great way off, think?" said the woman, earnestly.
 
"Much further than you think, poor child!" said Mrs. Bird "but we will
try to think what can be done for you. Here, Dinah, make her up a bed in
your own room, close by the kitchen, and Ill think what to do for her
in the morning. Meanwhile, never fear, poor woman put your trust in
God he will protect you."
 
Mrs. Bird and her husband reentered the parlor. She sat down in her
little rockingchair before the fire, swaying thoughtfully to and fro.
Mr. Bird strode up and down the room, grumbling to himself, "Pish!
pshaw! confounded awkward business!" At length, striding up to his wife,
he said,
 
"I say, wife, shell have to get away from here, this very night. That
fellow will be down on the scent bright and early tomorrow morning if
t was only the woman, she could lie quiet till it was over but that
little chap cant be kept still by a troop of horse and foot, Ill
warrant me hell bring it all out, popping his head out of some window
or door. A pretty kettle of fish it would be for me, too, to be caught
with them both here, just now! No theyll have to be got off tonight."
 
"Tonight! How is it possible?where to?"
 
"Well, I know pretty well where to," said the senator, beginning to put
on his boots, with a reflective air and, stopping when his leg was half
in, he embraced his knee with both hands, and seemed to go off in deep
meditation.
 
"Its a confounded awkward, ugly business," said he, at last, beginning
to tug at his bootstraps again, "and thats a fact!" After one boot
was fairly on, the senator sat with the other in his hand, profoundly
studying the figure of the carpet. "It will have to be done, though, for
aught I see,hang it all!" and he drew the other boot anxiously on, and
looked out of the window.
 
Now, little Mrs. Bird was a discreet woman,a woman who never in her
life said, "I told you so!" and, on the present occasion, though pretty
well aware of the shape her husbands meditations were taking, she very
prudently forbore to meddle with them, only sat very quietly in her
chair, and looked quite ready to hear her liege lords intentions, when
he should think proper to utter them.
 
"You see," he said, "theres my old client, Van Trompe, has come over
from Kentucky, and set all his slaves free and he has bought a place
seven miles up the creek, here, back in the woods, where nobody goes,
unless they go on purpose and its a place that isnt found in a hurry.
There shed be safe enough but the plague of the thing is, nobody could
drive a carriage there tonight, but _me_."
 
"Why not? Cudjoe is an excellent driver."
 
"Ay, ay, but here it is. The creek has to be crossed twice and the
second crossing is quite dangerous, unless one knows it as I do. I have
crossed it a hundred times on horseback, and know exactly the turns to
take. And so, you see, theres no help for it. Cudjoe must put in the
horses, as quietly as may be, about twelve oclock, and Ill take her
over and then, to give color to the matter, he must carry me on to the
next tavern to take the stage for Columbus, that comes by about three or
four, and so it will look as if I had had the carriage only for that.
I shall get into business bright and early in the morning. But Im
thinking I shall feel rather cheap there, after all thats been said and
done but, hang it, I cant help it!"
 
"Your heart is better than your head, in this case, John," said the
wife, laying her little white hand on his. "Could I ever have loved you,
had I not known you better than you know yourself?" And the little
woman looked so handsome, with the tears sparkling in her eyes, that
the senator thought he must be a decidedly clever fellow, to get such a
pretty creature into such a passionate admiration of him and so, what
could he do but walk off soberly, to see about the carriage. At the
door, however, he stopped a moment, and then coming back, he said, with
some hesitation.
 
"Mary, I dont know how youd feel about it, but theres that drawer
full of thingsofofpoor little Henrys." So saying, he turned
quickly on his heel, and shut the door after him.
 
His wife opened the little bedroom door adjoining her room and, taking
the candle, set it down on the top of a bureau there then from a small
recess she took a key, and put it thoughtfully in the lock of a drawer,
and made a sudden pause, while two boys, who, boy like, had followed
close on her heels, stood looking, with silent, significant glances, at
their mother. And oh! mother that reads this, has there never been in
your house a drawer, or a closet, the opening of which has been to you
like the opening again of a little grave? Ah! happy mother that you are,
if it has not been so.
 
Mrs. Bird slowly opened the drawer. There were little coats of many a
form and pattern, piles of aprons, and rows of small stockings and even
a pair of little shoes, worn and rubbed at the toes, were peeping
from the folds of a paper. There was a toy horse and wagon, a top, a
ball,memorials gathered with many a tear and many a heartbreak! She
sat down by the drawer, and, leaning her head on her hands over it, wept
till the tears fell through her fingers into the drawer then suddenly
raising her head, she began, with nervous haste, selecting the plainest
and most substantial articles, and gathering them into a bundle.
 
"Mamma," said one of the boys, gently touching her arm, "you going to
give away _those_ things?"
 
"My dear boys," she said, softly and earnestly, "if our dear, loving
little Henry looks down from heaven, he would be glad to have us do
this. I could not find it in my heart to give them away to any common
personto anybody that was happy but I give them to a mother more
heartbroken and sorrowful than I am and I hope God will send his
blessings with them!"
 
There are in this world blessed souls, whose sorrows all spring up into
joys for others whose earthly hopes, laid in the grave with many tears,
are the seed from which spring healing flowers and balm for the desolate
and the distressed. Among such was the delicate woman who sits there by
the lamp, dropping slow tears, while she prepares the memorials of her
own lost one for the outcast wanderer.
 
After a while, Mrs. Bird opened a wardrobe, and, taking from thence a
plain, serviceable dress or two, she sat down busily to her worktable,
and, with needle, scissors, and thimble, at hand, quietly commenced the
"letting down" process which her husband had recommended, and continued
busily at it till the old clock in the corner struck twelve, and she
heard the low rattling of wheels at the door.
 
"Mary," said her husband, coming in, with his overcoat in his hand, "you
must wake her up now we must be off."
 
Mrs. Bird hastily deposited the various articles she had collected in a
small plain trunk, and locking it, desired her husband to see it in
the carriage, and then proceeded to call the woman. Soon, arrayed in
a cloak, bonnet, and shawl, that had belonged to her benefactress, she
appeared at the door with her child in her arms. Mr. Bird hurried her
into the carriage, and Mrs. Bird pressed on after her to the carriage
steps. Eliza leaned out of the carriage, and put out her hand,a hand
as soft and beautiful as was given in return. She fixed her large, dark
eyes, full of earnest meaning, on Mrs. Birds face, and seemed going
to speak. Her lips moved,she tried once or twice, but there was no
sound,and pointing upward, with a look never to be forgotten, she
fell back in the seat, and covered her face. The door was shut, and the
carriage drove on.
 
What a situation, now, for a patriotic senator, that had been all the
week before spurring up the legislature of his native state to pass more
stringent resolutions against escaping fugitives, their harborers and
abettors!
 
Our good senator in his native state had not been exceeded by any of his
brethren at Washington, in the sort of eloquence which has won for them
immortal renown! How sublimely he had sat with his hands in his pockets,
and scouted all sentimental weakness of those who would put the welfare
of a few miserable fugitives before great state interests!
 
He was as bold as a lion about it, and "mightily convinced" not only
himself, but everybody that heard himbut then his idea of a fugitive
was only an idea of the letters that spell the word,or at the most,
the image of a little newspaper picture of a man with a stick and bundle
with "Ran away from the subscriber" under it. The magic of the real
presence of distress,the imploring human eye, the frail, trembling
human hand, the despairing appeal of helpless agony,these he had never
tried. He had never thought that a fugitive might be a hapless mother,
a defenceless child,like that one which was now wearing his lost boys
little wellknown cap and so, as our poor senator was not stone or
steel,as he was a man, and a downright noblehearted one, too,he
was, as everybody must see, in a sad case for his patriotism. And you
need not exult over him, good brother of the Southern States for we
have some inklings that many of you, under similar circumstances,
would not do much better. We have reason to know, in Kentucky, as in
Mississippi, are noble and generous hearts, to whom never was tale of
suffering told in vain. Ah, good brother! is it fair for you to expect
of us services which your own brave, honorable heart would not allow you
to render, were you in our place?
 
Be that as it may, if our good senator was a political sinner, he was in
a fair way to expiate it by his nights penance. There had been a long
continuous period of rainy weather, and the soft, rich earth of Ohio, as
every one knows, is admirably suited to the manufacture of mudand the
road was an Ohio railroad of the good old times.
 
"And pray, what sort of a road may that be?" says some eastern
traveller, who has been accustomed to connect no ideas with a railroad,
but those of smoothness or speed.
 
Know, then, innocent eastern friend, that in benighted regions of the
west, where the mud is of unfathomable and sublime depth, roads are made
of round rough logs, arranged transversely side by side, and coated over
in their pristine freshness with earth, turf, and whatsoever may come to
hand, and then the rejoicing native calleth it a road, and straightway
essayeth to ride thereupon. In process of time, the rains wash off
all the turf and grass aforesaid, move the logs hither and thither, in
picturesque positions, up, down and crosswise, with divers chasms and
ruts of black mud intervening.
 
Over such a road as this our senator went stumbling along, making
moral reflections as continuously as under the circumstances could be
expected,the carriage proceeding along much as follows,bump! bump!
bump! slush! down in the mud!the senator, woman and child, reversing
their positions so suddenly as to come, without any very accurate
adjustment, against the windows of the downhill side. Carriage sticks
fast, while Cudjoe on the outside is heard making a great muster among
the horses. After various ineffectual pullings and twitchings, just as
the senator is losing all patience, the carriage suddenly rights
itself with a bounce,two front wheels go down into another abyss,
and senator, woman, and child, all tumble promiscuously on to the
front seat,senators hat is jammed over his eyes and nose quite
unceremoniously, and he considers himself fairly extinguishedchild
cries, and Cudjoe on the outside delivers animated addresses to the
horses, who are kicking, and floundering, and straining under repeated
cracks of the whip. Carriage springs up, with another bounce,down go
the hind wheels,senator, woman, and child, fly over on to the back
seat, his elbows encountering her bonnet, and both her feet being jammed
into his hat, which flies off in the concussion. After a few moments the
"slough" is passed, and the horses stop, pantingthe senator finds
his hat, the woman straightens her bonnet and hushes her child, and they
brace themselves for what is yet to come.
 
For a while only the continuous bump! bump! intermingled, just by way of
variety, with divers side plunges and compound shakes and they begin to
flatter themselves that they are not so badly off, after all. At last,
with a square plunge, which puts all on to their feet and then down into
their seats with incredible quickness, the carriage stops,and, after
much outside commotion, Cudjoe appears at the door.
 
"Please, sir, its powerful bad spot, this yer. I dont know how wes
to get clar out. Im a thinkin well have to be a gettin rails."
 
The senator despairingly steps out, picking gingerly for some firm
foothold down goes one foot an immeasurable depth,he tries to pull it
up, loses his balance, and tumbles over into the mud, and is fished out,
in a very despairing condition, by Cudjoe.
 
But we forbear, out of sympathy to our readers bones. Western
travellers, who have beguiled the midnight hour in the interesting
process of pulling down rail fences, to pry their carriages out of mud
holes, will have a respectful and mournful sympathy with our unfortunate
hero. We beg them to drop a silent tear, and pass on.
 
It was full late in the night when the carriage emerged, dripping
and bespattered, out of the creek, and stood at the door of a large
farmhouse.
 
It took no inconsiderable perseverance to arouse the inmates but at
last the respectable proprietor appeared, and undid the door. He was a
great, tall, bristling Orson of a fellow, full six feet and some inches
in his stockings, and arrayed in a red flannel huntingshirt. A very
heavy mat of sandy hair, in a decidedly tousled condition, and a beard
of some days growth, gave the worthy man an appearance, to say the
least, not particularly prepossessing. He stood for a few minutes
holding the candle aloft, and blinking on our travellers with a dismal
and mystified expression that was truly ludicrous. It cost some effort
of our senator to induce him to comprehend the case fully and while he
is doing his best at that, we shall give him a little introduction to
our readers.
 
Honest old John Van Trompe was once quite a considerable landowner and
slaveowner in the State of Kentucky. Having "nothing of the bear about
him but the skin," and being gifted by nature with a great, honest, just
heart, quite equal to his gigantic frame, he had been for some years
witnessing with repressed uneasiness the workings of a system equally
bad for oppressor and oppressed. At last, one day, Johns great heart
had swelled altogether too big to wear his bonds any longer so he
just took his pocketbook out of his desk, and went over into Ohio, and
bought a quarter of a township of good, rich land, made out free papers
for all his people,men, women, and children,packed them up in
wagons, and sent them off to settle down and then honest John turned
his face up the creek, and sat quietly down on a snug, retired farm, to
enjoy his conscience and his reflections.
 
"Are you the man that will shelter a poor woman and child from
slavecatchers?" said the senator, explicitly.
 
"I rather think I am," said honest John, with some considerable
emphasis.
 
"I thought so," said the senator.
 
"If theres anybody comes," said the good man, stretching his tall,
muscular form upward, "why here Im ready for him and Ive got seven
sons, each six foot high, and theyll be ready for em. Give our
respects to em," said John "tell em its no matter how soon they
call,make no kinder difference to us," said John, running his fingers
through the shock of hair that thatched his head, and bursting out into
a great laugh.
 
Weary, jaded, and spiritless, Eliza dragged herself up to the door,
with her child lying in a heavy sleep on her arm. The rough man held the
candle to her face, and uttering a kind of compassionate grunt, opened
the door of a small bedroom adjoining to the large kitchen where they
were standing, and motioned her to go in. He took down a candle, and
lighting it, set it upon the table, and then addressed himself to Eliza.
 
"Now, I say, gal, you neednt be a bit afeard, let who will come here.
Im up to all that sort o thing," said he, pointing to two or three
goodly rifles over the mantelpiece "and most people that know me know
that t wouldnt be healthy to try to get anybody out o my house when
Im agin it. So _now_ you jist go to sleep now, as quiet as if yer
mother was a rockin ye," said he, as he shut the door.
 
"Why, this is an uncommon handsome un," he said to the senator. "Ah,
well handsome uns has the greatest cause to run, sometimes, if they has
any kind o feelin, such as decent women should. I know all about that."
 
The senator, in a few words, briefly explained Elizas history.
 
"O! ou! aw! now, I want to know?" said the good man, pitifully
"sho! now sho! Thats natur now, poor crittur! hunted down now like a
deer,hunted down, jest for havin natural feelins, and doin what no
kind o mother could help a doin! I tell ye what, these yer things make
me come the nighest to swearin, now, o most anything," said honest
John, as he wiped his eyes with the back of a great, freckled, yellow
hand. "I tell yer what, stranger, it was years and years before Id jine
the church, cause the ministers round in our parts used to preach that
the Bible went in for these ere cuttings up,and I couldnt be up to
em with their Greek and Hebrew, and so I took up agin em, Bible and
all. I never jined the church till I found a minister that was up to em
all in Greek and all that, and he said right the contrary and then I
took right hold, and jined the church,I did now, fact," said John, who
had been all this time uncorking some very frisky bottled cider, which
at this juncture he presented.
 
"Yed better jest put up here, now, till daylight," said he, heartily,
"and Ill call up the old woman, and have a bed got ready for you in no
time."
 
"Thank you, my good friend," said the senator, "I must be along, to take
the night stage for Columbus."
 
"Ah! well, then, if you must, Ill go a piece with you, and show you a
cross road that will take you there better than the road you came on.
That roads mighty bad."
 
John equipped himself, and, with a lantern in hand, was soon seen
guiding the senators carriage towards a road that ran down in a hollow,
back of his dwelling. When they parted, the senator put into his hand a
tendollar bill.
 
"Its for her," he said, briefly.
 
"Ay, ay," said John, with equal conciseness.
 
They shook hands, and parted.
 
 
 
CHAPTER X
 
The Property Is Carried Off
 
 
The February morning looked gray and drizzling through the window of
Uncle Toms cabin. It looked on downcast faces, the images of mournful
hearts. The little table stood out before the fire, covered with an
ironingcloth a coarse but clean shirt or two, fresh from the iron,
hung on the back of a chair by the fire, and Aunt Chloe had another
spread out before her on the table. Carefully she rubbed and ironed
every fold and every hem, with the most scrupulous exactness, every now
and then raising her hand to her face to wipe off the tears that were
coursing down her cheeks.
 
Tom sat by, with his Testament open on his knee, and his head leaning
upon his handbut neither spoke. It was yet early, and the children
lay all asleep together in their little rude trundlebed.
 
Tom, who had, to the full, the gentle, domestic heart, which woe for
them! has been a peculiar characteristic of his unhappy race, got up and
walked silently to look at his children.
 
"Its the last time," he said.
 
Aunt Chloe did not answer, only rubbed away over and over on the coarse
shirt, already as smooth as hands could make it and finally setting her
iron suddenly down with a despairing plunge, she sat down to the table,
and "lifted up her voice and wept."
 
"Spose we must be resigned but oh Lord! how ken I? If I knowd
anything whar you s goin, or how theyd sarve you! Missis says shell
try and deem ye, in a year or two but Lor! nobody never comes up that
goes down thar! They kills em! Ive hearn em tell how dey works em up
on dem ar plantations."
 
"Therell be the same God there, Chloe, that there is here."
 
"Well," said Aunt Chloe, "spose dere will but de Lord lets drefful
things happen, sometimes. I dont seem to get no comfort dat way."
 
"Im in the Lords hands," said Tom "nothin can go no furder than he
lets itand thars _one_ thing I can thank him for. Its _me_
thats sold and going down, and not you nur the chilen. Here youre
safewhat comes will come only on me and the Lord, hell help me,I
know he will."
 
Ah, brave, manly heart,smothering thine own sorrow, to comfort thy
beloved ones! Tom spoke with a thick utterance, and with a bitter
choking in his throat,but he spoke brave and strong.
 
"Lets think on our marcies!" he added, tremulously, as if he was quite
sure he needed to think on them very hard indeed.
 
"Marcies!" said Aunt Chloe "dont see no marcy in t! tant right!
tant right it should be so! Masr never ought ter left it so that ye
_could_ be took for his debts. Yeve arnt him all he gets for ye, twice
over. He owed ye yer freedom, and ought ter gin t to yer years ago.
Mebbe he cant help himself now, but I feel its wrong. Nothing cant
beat that ar out o me. Sich a faithful crittur as yeve been,and
allers sot his business fore yer own every way,and reckoned on him
more than yer own wife and chilen! Them as sells hearts love and
hearts blood, to get out thar scrapes, de Lordll be up to em!"
 
"Chloe! now, if ye love me, ye wont talk so, when perhaps jest the last
time well ever have together! And Ill tell ye, Chloe, it goes agin me
to hear one word agin Masr. Want he put in my arms a baby?its natur
I should think a heap of him. And he couldnt be spected to think so
much of poor Tom. Masrs is used to havin all these yer things done for
em, and natlly they dont think so much on t. They cant be spected
to, no way. Set him longside of other Masrswhos had the treatment
and livin Ive had? And he never would have let this yer come on me, if
he could have seed it aforehand. I know he wouldnt."
 
"Wal, any way, thars wrong about it _somewhar_," said Aunt Chloe, in
whom a stubborn sense of justice was a predominant trait "I cant jest
make out whar t is, but thars wrong somewhar, Im _clar_ o that."
 
"Yer ought ter look up to the Lord abovehes above allthar dont a
sparrow fall without him."
 
"It dont seem to comfort me, but I spect it orter," said Aunt Chloe.
"But dars no use talkin Ill jes wet up de corncake, and get ye one
good breakfast, cause nobody knows when youll get another."
 
In order to appreciate the sufferings of the negroes sold south, it
must be remembered that all the instinctive affections of that race are
peculiarly strong. Their local attachments are very abiding. They are
not naturally daring and enterprising, but homeloving and affectionate.
Add to this all the terrors with which ignorance invests the unknown,
and add to this, again, that selling to the south is set before the
negro from childhood as the last severity of punishment. The threat that
terrifies more than whipping or torture of any kind is the threat of
being sent down river. We have ourselves heard this feeling expressed by
them, and seen the unaffected horror with which they will sit in their
gossipping hours, and tell frightful stories of that "down river," which
to them is
 
     _"That undiscovered country, from whose bourn
     No traveller returns."_
 
 
       A slightly inaccurate quotation from _Hamlet_, Act III,
     scene I, lines 369370.
 
A missionary figure among the fugitives in Canada told us that many of
the fugitives confessed themselves to have escaped from comparatively
kind masters, and that they were induced to brave the perils of escape,
in almost every case, by the desperate horror with which they regarded
being sold south,a doom which was hanging either over themselves
or their husbands, their wives or children. This nerves the African,
naturally patient, timid and unenterprising, with heroic courage, and
leads him to suffer hunger, cold, pain, the perils of the wilderness,
and the more dread penalties of recapture.
 
The simple morning meal now smoked on the table, for Mrs. Shelby had
excused Aunt Chloes attendance at the great house that morning.
The poor soul had expended all her little energies on this farewell
feast,had killed and dressed her choicest chicken, and prepared her
corncake with scrupulous exactness, just to her husbands taste, and
brought out certain mysterious jars on the mantelpiece, some preserves
that were never produced except on extreme occasions.
 
"Lor, Pete," said Mose, triumphantly, "hant we got a buster of a
breakfast!" at the same time catching at a fragment of the chicken.
 
Aunt Chloe gave him a sudden box on the ear. "Thar now! crowing over the
last breakfast yer poor daddys gwine to have to home!"
 
"O, Chloe!" said Tom, gently.
 
"Wal, I cant help it," said Aunt Chloe, hiding her face in her apron
"I s so tossed about it, it makes me act ugly."
 
The boys stood quite still, looking first at their father and then
at their mother, while the baby, climbing up her clothes, began an
imperious, commanding cry.
 
"Thar!" said Aunt Chloe, wiping her eyes and taking up the baby "now
Is done, I hope,now do eat something. This yers my nicest chicken.
Thar, boys, ye shall have some, poor critturs! Yer mammys been cross to
yer."
 
The boys needed no second invitation, and went in with great zeal for
the eatables and it was well they did so, as otherwise there would have
been very little performed to any purpose by the party.
 
"Now," said Aunt Chloe, bustling about after breakfast, "I must put
up yer clothes. Jest like as not, hell take em all away. I know thar
waysmean as dirt, they is! Wal, now, yer flannels for rhumatis is in
this corner so be careful, cause there wont nobody make ye no more.
Then heres yer old shirts, and these yer is new ones. I toed off these
yer stockings last night, and put de ball in em to mend with. But Lor!
wholl ever mend for ye?" and Aunt Chloe, again overcome, laid her head
on the box side, and sobbed. "To think on t! no crittur to do for ye,
sick or well! I dont railly think I ought ter be good now!"
 
The boys, having eaten everything there was on the breakfasttable,
began now to take some thought of the case and, seeing their mother
crying, and their father looking very sad, began to whimper and put
their hands to their eyes. Uncle Tom had the baby on his knee, and was
letting her enjoy herself to the utmost extent, scratching his face
and pulling his hair, and occasionally breaking out into clamorous
explosions of delight, evidently arising out of her own internal
reflections.
 
"Ay, crow away, poor crittur!" said Aunt Chloe "yell have to come to
it, too! yell live to see yer husband sold, or mebbe be sold yerself
and these yer boys, theys to be sold, I spose, too, jest like as
not, when dey gets good for somethin ant no use in niggers havin
nothin!"
 
Here one of the boys called out, "Thars Missis acomin in!"
 
"She cant do no good whats she coming for?" said Aunt Chloe.
 
Mrs. Shelby entered. Aunt Chloe set a chair for her in a manner
decidedly gruff and crusty. She did not seem to notice either the action
or the manner. She looked pale and anxious.
 
"Tom," she said, "I come to" and stopping suddenly, and regarding the
silent group, she sat down in the chair, and, covering her face with her
handkerchief, began to sob.
 
"Lor, now, Missis, dontdont!" said Aunt Chloe, bursting out in her
turn and for a few moments they all wept in company. And in those tears
they all shed together, the high and the lowly, melted away all
the heartburnings and anger of the oppressed. O, ye who visit the
distressed, do ye know that everything your money can buy, given with a
cold, averted face, is not worth one honest tear shed in real sympathy?
 
"My good fellow," said Mrs. Shelby, "I cant give you anything to do
you any good. If I give you money, it will only be taken from you. But
I tell you solemnly, and before God, that I will keep trace of you,
and bring you back as soon as I can command the moneyand, till then,
trust in God!"
 
Here the boys called out that Masr Haley was coming, and then an
unceremonious kick pushed open the door. Haley stood there in very
ill humor, having ridden hard the night before, and being not at all
pacified by his ill success in recapturing his prey.
 
"Come," said he, "ye nigger, yer ready? Servant, maam!" said he,
taking off his hat, as he saw Mrs. Shelby.
 
Aunt Chloe shut and corded the box, and, getting up, looked gruffly on
the trader, her tears seeming suddenly turned to sparks of fire.
 
Tom rose up meekly, to follow his new master, and raised up his heavy
box on his shoulder. His wife took the baby in her arms to go with him
to the wagon, and the children, still crying, trailed on behind.
 
Mrs. Shelby, walking up to the trader, detained him for a few moments,
talking with him in an earnest manner and while she was thus talking,
the whole family party proceeded to a wagon, that stood ready harnessed
at the door. A crowd of all the old and young hands on the place stood
gathered around it, to bid farewell to their old associate. Tom had been
looked up to, both as a head servant and a Christian teacher, by all
the place, and there was much honest sympathy and grief about him,
particularly among the women.
 
"Why, Chloe, you bar it better n we do!" said one of the women, who had
been weeping freely, noticing the gloomy calmness with which Aunt Chloe
stood by the wagon.
 
"Is done _my_ tears!" she said, looking grimly at the trader, who was
coming up. "I does not feel to cry fore dat ar old limb, no how!"
 
"Get in!" said Haley to Tom, as he strode through the crowd of servants,
who looked at him with lowering brows.
 
Tom got in, and Haley, drawing out from under the wagon seat a heavy
pair of shackles, made them fast around each ankle.
 
A smothered groan of indignation ran through the whole circle, and
Mrs. Shelby spoke from the verandah,"Mr. Haley, I assure you that
precaution is entirely unnecessary."
 
"Don know, maam Ive lost one five hundred dollars from this yer
place, and I cant afford to run no more risks."
 
"What else could she spect on him?" said Aunt Chloe, indignantly,
while the two boys, who now seemed to comprehend at once their fathers
destiny, clung to her gown, sobbing and groaning vehemently.
 
"Im sorry," said Tom, "that Masr George happened to be away."
 
George had gone to spend two or three days with a companion on a
neighboring estate, and having departed early in the morning, before
Toms misfortune had been made public, had left without hearing of it.
 
"Give my love to Masr George," he said, earnestly.
 
Haley whipped up the horse, and, with a steady, mournful look, fixed to
the last on the old place, Tom was whirled away.
 
Mr. Shelby at this time was not at home. He had sold Tom under the
spur of a driving necessity, to get out of the power of a man whom he
dreaded,and his first feeling, after the consummation of the bargain,
had been that of relief. But his wifes expostulations awoke his
halfslumbering regrets and Toms manly disinterestedness increased the
unpleasantness of his feelings. It was in vain that he said to himself
that he had a _right_ to do it,that everybody did it,and that some
did it without even the excuse of necessityhe could not satisfy his
own feelings and that he might not witness the unpleasant scenes of
the consummation, he had gone on a short business tour up the country,
hoping that all would be over before he returned.
 
Tom and Haley rattled on along the dusty road, whirling past every old
familiar spot, until the bounds of the estate were fairly passed, and
they found themselves out on the open pike. After they had ridden about
a mile, Haley suddenly drew up at the door of a blacksmiths shop, when,
taking out with him a pair of handcuffs, he stepped into the shop, to
have a little alteration in them.
 
"These yer s a little too small for his build," said Haley, showing the
fetters, and pointing out to Tom.
 
"Lor! now, if thar ant Shelbys Tom. He hant sold him, now?" said the
smith.
 
"Yes, he has," said Haley.
 
"Now, ye dont! well, reely," said the smith, "whod a thought it! Why,
ye neednt go to fetterin him up this yer way. Hes the faithfullest,
best crittur"
 
"Yes, yes," said Haley "but your good fellers are just the critturs to
want ter run off. Them stupid ones, as doesnt care whar they go, and
shifless, drunken ones, as dont care for nothin, theyll stick by,
and like as not be rather pleased to be toted round but these yer
prime fellers, they hates it like sin. No way but to fetter em got
legs,theyll use em,no mistake."
 
"Well," said the smith, feeling among his tools, "them plantations down
thar, stranger, ant jest the place a Kentuck nigger wants to go to
they dies thar tolable fast, dont they?"
 
"Wal, yes, tolable fast, ther dying is what with the climating and
one thing and another, they dies so as to keep the market up pretty
brisk," said Haley.
 
"Wal, now, a feller cant help thinkin its a mighty pity to have a
nice, quiet, likely feller, as good un as Tom is, go down to be fairly
ground up on one of them ar sugar plantations."
 
"Wal, hes got a far chance. I promised to do well by him. Ill get
him in houseservant in some good old family, and then, if he stands the
fever and climating, hell have a berth good as any nigger ought ter
ask for."
 
"He leaves his wife and chilen up here, spose?"
 
"Yes but hell get another thar. Lord, thars women enough everywhar,"
said Haley.
 
Tom was sitting very mournfully on the outside of the shop while this
conversation was going on. Suddenly he heard the quick, short click of
a horses hoof behind him and, before he could fairly awake from his
surprise, young Master George sprang into the wagon, threw his arms
tumultuously round his neck, and was sobbing and scolding with energy.
 
"I declare, its real mean! I dont care what they say, any of em! Its
a nasty, mean shame! If I was a man, they shouldnt do it,they should
not, _so_!" said George, with a kind of subdued howl.
 
"O! Masr George! this does me good!" said Tom. "I couldnt bar to go
off without seein ye! It does me real good, ye cant tell!" Here Tom
made some movement of his feet, and Georges eye fell on the fetters.
 
"What a shame!" he exclaimed, lifting his hands. "Ill knock that old
fellow downI will!"
 
"No you wont, Masr George and you must not talk so loud. It wont
help me any, to anger him."
 
"Well, I wont, then, for your sake but only to think of itisnt it
a shame? They never sent for me, nor sent me any word, and, if it hadnt
been for Tom Lincon, I shouldnt have heard it. I tell you, I blew em
up well, all of em, at home!"
 
"That ar wasnt right, Im feard, Masr George."
 
"Cant help it! I say its a shame! Look here, Uncle Tom," said he,
turning his back to the shop, and speaking in a mysterious tone, _"Ive
brought you my dollar!"_
 
"O! I couldnt think o takin on t, Masr George, no ways in the
world!" said Tom, quite moved.
 
"But you _shall_ take it!" said George "look hereI told Aunt Chloe
Id do it, and she advised me just to make a hole in it, and put a
string through, so you could hang it round your neck, and keep it out of
sight else this mean scamp would take it away. I tell ye, Tom, I want
to blow him up! it would do me good!"
 
"No, dont Masr George, for it wont do _me_ any good."
 
"Well, I wont, for your sake," said George, busily tying his dollar
round Toms neck "but there, now, button your coat tight over it, and
keep it, and remember, every time you see it, that Ill come down after
you, and bring you back. Aunt Chloe and I have been talking about it. I
told her not to fear Ill see to it, and Ill tease fathers life out,
if he dont do it."
 
"O! Masr George, ye mustnt talk so bout yer father!"
 
"Lor, Uncle Tom, I dont mean anything bad."
 
"And now, Masr George," said Tom, "ye must be a good boy member how
many hearts is sot on ye. Alays keep close to yer mother. Dont be
gettin into any of them foolish ways boys has of gettin too big to
mind their mothers. Tell ye what, Masr George, the Lord gives good many
things twice over but he dont give ye a mother but once. Yell never
see sich another woman, Masr George, if ye live to be a hundred years
old. So, now, you hold on to her, and grow up, and be a comfort to her,
thars my own good boy,you will now, wont ye?"
 
"Yes, I will, Uncle Tom," said George seriously.
 
"And be careful of yer speaking, Masr George. Young boys, when they
comes to your age, is wilful, sometimesit is natur they should be.
But real gentlemen, such as I hopes youll be, never lets fall on words
that isnt spectful to thar parents. Ye ant fended, Masr George?"
 
"No, indeed, Uncle Tom you always did give me good advice."
 
"Is older, ye know," said Tom, stroking the boys fine, curly head with
his large, strong hand, but speaking in a voice as tender as a womans,
"and I sees all thats bound up in you. O, Masr George, you has
everything,larnin, privileges, readin, writin,and youll grow
up to be a great, learned, good man and all the people on the place and
your mother and fatherll be so proud on ye! Be a good Masr, like yer
father and be a Christian, like yer mother. Member yer Creator in the
days o yer youth, Masr George."
 
"Ill be _real_ good, Uncle Tom, I tell you," said George. "Im going to
be a _firstrater_ and dont you be discouraged. Ill have you back to
the place, yet. As I told Aunt Chloe this morning, Ill build our house
all over, and you shall have a room for a parlor with a carpet on it,
when Im a man. O, youll have good times yet!"
 
Haley now came to the door, with the handcuffs in his hands.
 
"Look here, now, Mister," said George, with an air of great superiority,
as he got out, "I shall let father and mother know how you treat Uncle
Tom!"
 
"Youre welcome," said the trader.
 
"I should think youd be ashamed to spend all your life buying men and
women, and chaining them, like cattle! I should think youd feel mean!"
said George.
 
"So long as your grand folks wants to buy men and women, Im as good
as they is," said Haley "tant any meaner sellin on em, that t is
buyin!"
 
"Ill never do either, when Im a man," said George "Im ashamed, this
day, that Im a Kentuckian. I always was proud of it before" and George
sat very straight on his horse, and looked round with an air, as if he
expected the state would be impressed with his opinion.
 
"Well, goodby, Uncle Tom keep a stiff upper lip," said George.
 
"Goodby, Masr George," said Tom, looking fondly and admiringly at him.
"God Almighty bless you! Ah! Kentucky hant got many like you!" he said,
in the fulness of his heart, as the frank, boyish face was lost to his
view. Away he went, and Tom looked, till the clatter of his horses
heels died away, the last sound or sight of his home. But over his heart
there seemed to be a warm spot, where those young hands had placed that
precious dollar. Tom put up his hand, and held it close to his heart.
 
"Now, I tell ye what, Tom," said Haley, as he came up to the wagon, and
threw in the handcuffs, "I mean to start far with ye, as I genally do
with my niggers and Ill tell ye now, to begin with, you treat me far,
and Ill treat you far I ant never hard on my niggers. Calculates to
do the best for em I can. Now, ye see, youd better jest settle down
comfortable, and not be tryin no tricks because niggers tricks of all
sorts Im up to, and its no use. If niggers is quiet, and dont try to
get off, they has good times with me and if they dont, why, its thar
fault, and not mine."
 
Tom assured Haley that he had no present intentions of running off. In
fact, the exhortation seemed rather a superfluous one to a man with a
great pair of iron fetters on his feet. But Mr. Haley had got in
the habit of commencing his relations with his stock with little
exhortations of this nature, calculated, as he deemed, to inspire
cheerfulness and confidence, and prevent the necessity of any unpleasant
scenes.
 
And here, for the present, we take our leave of Tom, to pursue the
fortunes of other characters in our story.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XI
 
In Which Property Gets into an Improper State of Mind
 
It was late in a drizzly afternoon that a traveler alighted at the door
of a small country hotel, in the village of N, in Kentucky. In the
barroom he found assembled quite a miscellaneous company, whom stress of
weather had driven to harbor, and the place presented the usual scenery
of such reunions. Great, tall, rawboned Kentuckians, attired in
huntingshirts, and trailing their loose joints over a vast extent of
territory, with the easy lounge peculiar to the race,rifles stacked
away in the corner, shotpouches, gamebags, huntingdogs, and little
negroes, all rolled together in the corners,were the characteristic
features in the picture. At each end of the fireplace sat a longlegged
gentleman, with his chair tipped back, his hat on his head, and the
heels of his muddy boots reposing sublimely on the mantelpiece,a
position, we will inform our readers, decidedly favorable to the turn
of reflection incident to western taverns, where travellers exhibit
a decided preference for this particular mode of elevating their
understandings.
 
Mine host, who stood behind the bar, like most of his country men, was
great of stature, goodnatured and loosejointed, with an enormous shock
of hair on his head, and a great tall hat on the top of that.
 
In fact, everybody in the room bore on his head this characteristic
emblem of mans sovereignty whether it were felt hat, palmleaf, greasy
beaver, or fine new chapeau, there it reposed with true republican
independence. In truth, it appeared to be the characteristic mark of
every individual. Some wore them tipped rakishly to one sidethese
were your men of humor, jolly, freeandeasy dogs some had them jammed
independently down over their nosesthese were your hard characters,
thorough men, who, when they wore their hats, _wanted_ to wear them, and
to wear them just as they had a mind to there were those who had them
set far over backwideawake men, who wanted a clear prospect while
careless men, who did not know, or care, how their hats sat, had them
shaking about in all directions. The various hats, in fact, were quite a
Shakespearean study.
 
Divers negroes, in very freeandeasy pantaloons, and with no redundancy
in the shirt line, were scuttling about, hither and thither, without
bringing to pass any very particular results, except expressing a
generic willingness to turn over everything in creation generally
for the benefit of Masr and his guests. Add to this picture a
jolly, crackling, rollicking fire, going rejoicingly up a great wide
chimney,the outer door and every window being set wide open, and the
calico windowcurtain flopping and snapping in a good stiff breeze
of damp raw air,and you have an idea of the jollities of a Kentucky
tavern.
 
Your Kentuckian of the present day is a good illustration of the
doctrine of transmitted instincts and pecularities. His fathers were
mighty hunters,men who lived in the woods, and slept under the free,
open heavens, with the stars to hold their candles and their descendant
to this day always acts as if the house were his camp,wears his hat
at all hours, tumbles himself about, and puts his heels on the tops of
chairs or mantelpieces, just as his father rolled on the green sward,
and put his upon trees and logs,keeps all the windows and doors
open, winter and summer, that he may get air enough for his great
lungs,calls everybody "stranger," with nonchalant _bonhommie_, and
is altogether the frankest, easiest, most jovial creature living.
 
Into such an assembly of the free and easy our traveller entered. He was
a short, thickset man, carefully dressed, with a round, goodnatured
countenance, and something rather fussy and particular in his
appearance. He was very careful of his valise and umbrella, bringing
them in with his own hands, and resisting, pertinaciously, all offers
from the various servants to relieve him of them. He looked round the
barroom with rather an anxious air, and, retreating with his valuables
to the warmest corner, disposed them under his chair, sat down, and
looked rather apprehensively up at the worthy whose heels illustrated
the end of the mantelpiece, who was spitting from right to left, with
a courage and energy rather alarming to gentlemen of weak nerves and
particular habits.
 
"I say, stranger, how are ye?" said the aforesaid gentleman, firing an
honorary salute of tobaccojuice in the direction of the new arrival.
 
"Well, I reckon," was the reply of the other, as he dodged, with some
alarm, the threatening honor.
 
"Any news?" said the respondent, taking out a strip of tobacco and a
large huntingknife from his pocket.
 
"Not that I know of," said the man.
 
"Chaw?" said the first speaker, handing the old gentleman a bit of his
tobacco, with a decidedly brotherly air.
 
"No, thank yeit dont agree with me," said the little man, edging off.
 
"Dont, eh?" said the other, easily, and stowing away the morsel in
his own mouth, in order to keep up the supply of tobaccojuice, for the
general benefit of society.
 
The old gentleman uniformly gave a little start whenever his longsided
brother fired in his direction and this being observed by his
companion, he very goodnaturedly turned his artillery to another
quarter, and proceeded to storm one of the fireirons with a degree of
military talent fully sufficient to take a city.
 
"Whats that?" said the old gentleman, observing some of the company
formed in a group around a large handbill.
 
"Nigger advertised!" said one of the company, briefly.
 
Mr. Wilson, for that was the old gentlemans name, rose up, and, after
carefully adjusting his valise and umbrella, proceeded deliberately to
take out his spectacles and fix them on his nose and, this operation
being performed, read as follows
 
     "Ran away from the subscriber, my mulatto boy, George. Said
     George six feet in height, a very light mulatto, brown curly
     hair is very intelligent, speaks handsomely, can read and
     write, will probably try to pass for a white man, is deeply
     scarred on his back and shoulders, has been branded in his
     right hand with the letter H.
 
     "I will give four hundred dollars for him alive, and the
     same sum for satisfactory proof that he has been _killed."_
 
The old gentleman read this advertisement from end to end in a low
voice, as if he were studying it.
 
The longlegged veteran, who had been besieging the fireiron, as before
related, now took down his cumbrous length, and rearing aloft his tall
form, walked up to the advertisement and very deliberately spit a full
discharge of tobaccojuice on it.
 
"Theres my mind upon that!" said he, briefly, and sat down again.
 
"Why, now, stranger, whats that for?" said mine host.
 
"Id do it all the same to the writer of that ar paper, if he was
here," said the long man, coolly resuming his old employment of cutting
tobacco. "Any man that owns a boy like that, and cant find any better
way o treating on him, _deserves_ to lose him. Such papers as these
is a shame to Kentucky thats my mind right out, if anybody wants to
know!"
 
"Well, now, thats a fact," said mine host, as he made an entry in his
book.
 
"Ive got a gang of boys, sir," said the long man, resuming his attack
on the fireirons, "and I jest tells emBoys, says I,_run_ now!
dig! put! jest when ye want to! I never shall come to look after you!
Thats the way I keep mine. Let em know they are free to run any time,
and it jest breaks up their wanting to. More n all, Ive got free
papers for em all recorded, in case I gets keeled up any o these
times, and they know it and I tell ye, stranger, there ant a fellow in
our parts gets more out of his niggers than I do. Why, my boys have been
to Cincinnati, with five hundred dollars worth of colts, and brought
me back the money, all straight, time and agin. It stands to reason
they should. Treat em like dogs, and youll have dogs works and dogs
actions. Treat em like men, and youll have mens works." And the
honest drover, in his warmth, endorsed this moral sentiment by firing a
perfect _feu de joi_ at the fireplace.
 
"I think youre altogether right, friend," said Mr. Wilson "and this
boy described here _is_ a fine fellowno mistake about that. He worked
for me some halfdozen years in my bagging factory, and he was my best
hand, sir. He is an ingenious fellow, too he invented a machine for
the cleaning of hempa really valuable affair its gone into use in
several factories. His master holds the patent of it."
 
"Ill warrant ye," said the drover, "holds it and makes money out of it,
and then turns round and brands the boy in his right hand. If I had a
fair chance, Id mark him, I reckon so that hed carry it _one_ while."
 
"These yer knowin boys is allers aggravatin and sarcy," said a
coarselooking fellow, from the other side of the room "thats why they
gets cut up and marked so. If they behaved themselves, they wouldnt."
 
"That is to say, the Lord made em men, and its a hard squeeze gettin
em down into beasts," said the drover, dryly.
 
"Bright niggers isnt no kind of vantage to their masters," continued
the other, well entrenched, in a coarse, unconscious obtuseness, from
the contempt of his opponent "whats the use o talents and them
things, if you cant get the use on em yourself? Why, all the use they
make on t is to get round you. Ive had one or two of these fellers,
and I jest sold em down river. I knew Id got to lose em, first or
last, if I didnt."
 
"Better send orders up to the Lord, to make you a set, and leave out
their souls entirely," said the drover.
 
Here the conversation was interrupted by the approach of a small
onehorse buggy to the inn. It had a genteel appearance, and a
welldressed, gentlemanly man sat on the seat, with a colored servant
driving.
 
The whole party examined the new comer with the interest with which a
set of loafers in a rainy day usually examine every newcomer. He was
very tall, with a dark, Spanish complexion, fine, expressive black eyes,
and closecurling hair, also of a glossy blackness. His wellformed
aquiline nose, straight thin lips, and the admirable contour of his
finelyformed limbs, impressed the whole company instantly with the idea
of something uncommon. He walked easily in among the company, and with
a nod indicated to his waiter where to place his trunk, bowed to the
company, and, with his hat in his hand, walked up leisurely to the bar,
and gave in his name as Henry Butter, Oaklands, Shelby County. Turning,
with an indifferent air, he sauntered up to the advertisement, and read
it over.
 
"Jim," he said to his man, "seems to me we met a boy something like
this, up at Bemans, didnt we?"
 
"Yes, Masr," said Jim, "only I ant sure about the hand."
 
"Well, I didnt look, of course," said the stranger with a careless
yawn. Then walking up to the landlord, he desired him to furnish him
with a private apartment, as he had some writing to do immediately.
 
The landlord was all obsequious, and a relay of about seven negroes, old
and young, male and female, little and big, were soon whizzing about,
like a covey of partridges, bustling, hurrying, treading on each others
toes, and tumbling over each other, in their zeal to get Masrs room
ready, while he seated himself easily on a chair in the middle of the
room, and entered into conversation with the man who sat next to him.
 
The manufacturer, Mr. Wilson, from the time of the entrance of
the stranger, had regarded him with an air of disturbed and uneasy
curiosity. He seemed to himself to have met and been acquainted with him
somewhere, but he could not recollect. Every few moments, when the man
spoke, or moved, or smiled, he would start and fix his eyes on him, and
then suddenly withdraw them, as the bright, dark eyes met his with such
unconcerned coolness. At last, a sudden recollection seemed to flash
upon him, for he stared at the stranger with such an air of blank
amazement and alarm, that he walked up to him.
 
"Mr. Wilson, I think," said he, in a tone of recognition, and extending
his hand. "I beg your pardon, I didnt recollect you before. I see you
remember me,Mr. Butler, of Oaklands, Shelby County."
 
"Yeyesyes, sir," said Mr. Wilson, like one speaking in a dream.
 
Just then a negro boy entered, and announced that Masrs room was
ready.
 
"Jim, see to the trunks," said the gentleman, negligently then
addressing himself to Mr. Wilson, he added"I should like to have a few
moments conversation with you on business, in my room, if you please."
 
Mr. Wilson followed him, as one who walks in his sleep and they
proceeded to a large upper chamber, where a newmade fire was crackling,
and various servants flying about, putting finishing touches to the
arrangements.
 
When all was done, and the servants departed, the young man deliberately
locked the door, and putting the key in his pocket, faced about, and
folding his arms on his bosom, looked Mr. Wilson full in the face.
 
"George!" said Mr. Wilson.
 
"Yes, George," said the young man.
 
"I couldnt have thought it!"
 
"I am pretty well disguised, I fancy," said the young man, with a smile.
"A little walnut bark has made my yellow skin a genteel brown, and Ive
dyed my hair black so you see I dont answer to the advertisement at
all."
 
"O, George! but this is a dangerous game you are playing. I could not
have advised you to it."
 
"I can do it on my own responsibility," said George, with the same proud
smile.
 
We remark, _en passant_, that George was, by his fathers side, of white
descent. His mother was one of those unfortunates of her race, marked
out by personal beauty to be the slave of the passions of her possessor,
and the mother of children who may never know a father. From one of the
proudest families in Kentucky he had inherited a set of fine European
features, and a high, indomitable spirit. From his mother he had
received only a slight mulatto tinge, amply compensated by its
accompanying rich, dark eye. A slight change in the tint of the skin
and the color of his hair had metamorphosed him into the Spanishlooking
fellow he then appeared and as gracefulness of movement and gentlemanly
manners had always been perfectly natural to him, he found no difficulty
in playing the bold part he had adoptedthat of a gentleman travelling
with his domestic.
 
Mr. Wilson, a goodnatured but extremely fidgety and cautious old
gentleman, ambled up and down the room, appearing, as John Bunyan hath
it, "much tumbled up and down in his mind," and divided between his wish
to help George, and a certain confused notion of maintaining law and
order so, as he shambled about, he delivered himself as follows
 
"Well, George, I spose youre running awayleaving your lawful
master, GeorgeI dont wonder at itat the same time, Im sorry,
George,yes, decidedlyI think I must say that, Georgeits my duty
to tell you so."
 
"Why are you sorry, sir?" said George, calmly.
 
"Why, to see you, as it were, setting yourself in opposition to the laws
of your country."
 
"_My_ country!" said George, with a strong and bitter emphasis "what
country have I, but the grave,and I wish to God that I was laid
there!"
 
"Why, George, nonoit wont do this way of talking is
wickedunscriptural. George, youve got a hard masterin fact, he
iswell he conducts himself reprehensiblyI cant pretend to defend
him. But you know how the angel commanded Hagar to return to her
mistress, and submit herself under the hand and the apostle sent back
Onesimus to his master."
 
       Gen. 16.  The angel bade the pregnant Hagar return to her
     mistress Sarai, even though Sarai had dealt harshly with
     her.
 
       Phil. 110.  Onesimus went back to his master to become
     no longer a servant but a "brother beloved."
 
"Dont quote Bible at me that way, Mr. Wilson," said George, with a
flashing eye, "dont! for my wife is a Christian, and I mean to be,
if ever I get to where I can but to quote Bible to a fellow in my
circumstances, is enough to make him give it up altogether. I appeal to
God AlmightyIm willing to go with the case to Him, and ask Him if I
do wrong to seek my freedom."
 
"These feelings are quite natural, George," said the goodnatured
man, blowing his nose. "Yes, theyre natural, but it is my duty not to
encourage em in you. Yes, my boy, Im sorry for you, now its a
bad casevery bad but the apostle says, Let everyone abide in the
condition in which he is called. We must all submit to the indications
of Providence, George,dont you see?"
 
George stood with his head drawn back, his arms folded tightly over his
broad breast, and a bitter smile curling his lips.
 
"I wonder, Mr. Wilson, if the Indians should come and take you a
prisoner away from your wife and children, and want to keep you all your
life hoeing corn for them, if youd think it your duty to abide in the
condition in which you were called. I rather think that youd think the
first stray horse you could find an indication of Providenceshouldnt
you?"
 
The little old gentleman stared with both eyes at this illustration of
the case but, though not much of a reasoner, he had the sense in which
some logicians on this particular subject do not excel,that of saying
nothing, where nothing could be said. So, as he stood carefully stroking
his umbrella, and folding and patting down all the creases in it, he
proceeded on with his exhortations in a general way.
 
"You see, George, you know, now, I always have stood your friend and
whatever Ive said, Ive said for your good. Now, here, it seems to me,
youre running an awful risk. You cant hope to carry it out. If youre
taken, it will be worse with you than ever theyll only abuse you, and
half kill you, and sell you down the river."
 
"Mr. Wilson, I know all this," said George. "I _do_ run a risk, but"
he threw open his overcoat, and showed two pistols and a bowieknife.
"There!" he said, "Im ready for em! Down south I never _will_ go.
No! if it comes to that, I can earn myself at least six feet of free
soil,the first and last I shall ever own in Kentucky!"
 
"Why, George, this state of mind is awful its getting really desperate
George. Im concerned. Going to break the laws of your country!"
 
"My country again! Mr. Wilson, _you_ have a country but what country
have _I_, or any one like me, born of slave mothers? What laws are there
for us? We dont make them,we dont consent to them,we have nothing
to do with them all they do for us is to crush us, and keep us down.
Havent I heard your FourthofJuly speeches? Dont you tell us all,
once a year, that governments derive their just power from the consent
of the governed? Cant a fellow _think_, that hears such things? Cant
he put this and that together, and see what it comes to?"
 
Mr. Wilsons mind was one of those that may not unaptly be represented
by a bale of cotton,downy, soft, benevolently fuzzy and confused.
He really pitied George with all his heart, and had a sort of dim and
cloudy perception of the style of feeling that agitated him but
he deemed it his duty to go on talking _good_ to him, with infinite
pertinacity.
 
"George, this is bad. I must tell you, you know, as a friend, youd
better not be meddling with such notions they are bad, George, very
bad, for boys in your condition,very" and Mr. Wilson sat down to a
table, and began nervously chewing the handle of his umbrella.
 
"See here, now, Mr. Wilson," said George, coming up and sitting himself
determinately down in front of him "look at me, now. Dont I sit before
you, every way, just as much a man as you are? Look at my face,look at
my hands,look at my body," and the young man drew himself up proudly
"why am I _not_ a man, as much as anybody? Well, Mr. Wilson, hear what I
can tell you. I had a fatherone of your Kentucky gentlemenwho didnt
think enough of me to keep me from being sold with his dogs and horses,
to satisfy the estate, when he died. I saw my mother put up at sheriffs
sale, with her seven children. They were sold before her eyes, one by
one, all to different masters and I was the youngest. She came and
kneeled down before old Masr, and begged him to buy her with me, that
she might have at least one child with her and he kicked her away with
his heavy boot. I saw him do it and the last that I heard was her moans
and screams, when I was tied to his horses neck, to be carried off to
his place."
 
"Well, then?"
 
"My master traded with one of the men, and bought my oldest sister.
She was a pious, good girl,a member of the Baptist church,and as
handsome as my poor mother had been. She was well brought up, and had
good manners. At first, I was glad she was bought, for I had one friend
near me. I was soon sorry for it. Sir, I have stood at the door and
heard her whipped, when it seemed as if every blow cut into my naked
heart, and I couldnt do anything to help her and she was whipped, sir,
for wanting to live a decent Christian life, such as your laws give
no slave girl a right to live and at last I saw her chained with a
traders gang, to be sent to market in Orleans,sent there for
nothing else but that,and thats the last I know of her. Well, I
grew up,long years and years,no father, no mother, no sister, not
a living soul that cared for me more than a dog nothing but whipping,
scolding, starving. Why, sir, Ive been so hungry that I have been glad
to take the bones they threw to their dogs and yet, when I was a little
fellow, and laid awake whole nights and cried, it wasnt the hunger, it
wasnt the whipping, I cried for. No, sir, it was for _my mother_ and
_my sisters_,it was because I hadnt a friend to love me on earth. I
never knew what peace or comfort was. I never had a kind word spoken to
me till I came to work in your factory. Mr. Wilson, you treated me well
you encouraged me to do well, and to learn to read and write, and to
try to make something of myself and God knows how grateful I am for it.
Then, sir, I found my wife youve seen her,you know how beautiful
she is. When I found she loved me, when I married her, I scarcely could
believe I was alive, I was so happy and, sir, she is as good as she is
beautiful. But now what? Why, now comes my master, takes me right away
from my work, and my friends, and all I like, and grinds me down into
the very dirt! And why? Because, he says, I forgot who I was he says,
to teach me that I am only a nigger! After all, and last of all, he
comes between me and my wife, and says I shall give her up, and live
with another woman. And all this your laws give him power to do, in
spite of God or man. Mr. Wilson, look at it! There isnt _one_ of all
these things, that have broken the hearts of my mother and my sister,
and my wife and myself, but your laws allow, and give every man power to
do, in Kentucky, and none can say to him nay! Do you call these the laws
of _my_ country? Sir, I havent any country, anymore than I have any
father. But Im going to have one. I dont want anything of _your_
country, except to be let alone,to go peaceably out of it and when I
get to Canada, where the laws will own me and protect me, _that_ shall
be my country, and its laws I will obey. But if any man tries to stop
me, let him take care, for I am desperate. Ill fight for my liberty to
the last breath I breathe. You say your fathers did it if it was right
for them, it is right for me!"
 
This speech, delivered partly while sitting at the table, and partly
walking up and down the room,delivered with tears, and flashing eyes,
and despairing gestures,was altogether too much for the goodnatured
old body to whom it was addressed, who had pulled out a great yellow
silk pockethandkerchief, and was mopping up his face with great energy.
 
"Blast em all!" he suddenly broke out. "Havent I always said sothe
infernal old cusses! I hope I ant swearing, now. Well! go ahead,
George, go ahead but be careful, my boy dont shoot anybody, George,
unlesswellyoud _better_ not shoot, I reckon at least, I wouldnt
_hit_ anybody, you know. Where is your wife, George?" he added, as he
nervously rose, and began walking the room.
 
"Gone, sir gone, with her child in her arms, the Lord only knows
wheregone after the north star and when we ever meet, or whether we
meet at all in this world, no creature can tell."
 
"Is it possible! astonishing! from such a kind family?"
 
"Kind families get in debt, and the laws of _our_ country allow them
to sell the child out of its mothers bosom to pay its masters debts,"
said George, bitterly.
 
"Well, well," said the honest old man, fumbling in his pocket "I
spose, perhaps, I ant following my judgment,hang it, I _wont_
follow my judgment!" he added, suddenly "so here, George," and, taking
out a roll of bills from his pocketbook, he offered them to George.
 
"No, my kind, good sir!" said George, "youve done a great deal for me,
and this might get you into trouble. I have money enough, I hope, to
take me as far as I need it."
 
"No but you must, George. Money is a great help everywherecant have
too much, if you get it honestly. Take it,_do_ take it, _now_,do, my
boy!"
 
"On condition, sir, that I may repay it at some future time, I will,"
said George, taking up the money.
 
"And now, George, how long are you going to travel in this way?not
long or far, I hope. Its well carried on, but too bold. And this black
fellow,who is he?"
 
"A true fellow, who went to Canada more than a year ago. He heard, after
he got there, that his master was so angry at him for going off that
he had whipped his poor old mother and he has come all the way back to
comfort her, and get a chance to get her away."
 
"Has he got her?"
 
"Not yet he has been hanging about the place, and found no chance yet.
Meanwhile, he is going with me as far as Ohio, to put me among friends
that helped him, and then he will come back after her.
 
"Dangerous, very dangerous!" said the old man.
 
George drew himself up, and smiled disdainfully.
 
The old gentleman eyed him from head to foot, with a sort of innocent
wonder.
 
"George, something has brought you out wonderfully. You hold up your
head, and speak and move like another man," said Mr. Wilson.
 
"Because Im a _freeman_!" said George, proudly. "Yes, sir Ive said
Masr for the last time to any man. _Im free!"_
 
"Take care! You are not sure,you may be taken."
 
"All men are free and equal _in the grave_, if it comes to that, Mr.
Wilson," said George.
 
"Im perfectly dumbfounded with your boldness!" said Mr. Wilson,"to
come right here to the nearest tavern!"
 
"Mr. Wilson, it is _so_ bold, and this tavern is so near, that they
will never think of it they will look for me on ahead, and you yourself
wouldnt know me. Jims master dont live in this county he isnt known
in these parts. Besides, he is given up nobody is looking after him,
and nobody will take me up from the advertisement, I think."
 
"But the mark in your hand?"
 
George drew off his glove, and showed a newlyhealed scar in his hand.
 
"That is a parting proof of Mr. Harris regard," he said, scornfully.
"A fortnight ago, he took it into his head to give it to me, because
he said he believed I should try to get away one of these days. Looks
interesting, doesnt it?" he said, drawing his glove on again.
 
"I declare, my very blood runs cold when I think of it,your condition
and your risks!" said Mr. Wilson.
 
"Mine has run cold a good many years, Mr. Wilson at present, its about
up to the boiling point," said George.
 
"Well, my good sir," continued George, after a few moments silence, "I
saw you knew me I thought Id just have this talk with you, lest your
surprised looks should bring me out. I leave early tomorrow morning,
before daylight by tomorrow night I hope to sleep safe in Ohio. I shall
travel by daylight, stop at the best hotels, go to the dinnertables
with the lords of the land. So, goodby, sir if you hear that Im
taken, you may know that Im dead!"
 
George stood up like a rock, and put out his hand with the air of a
prince. The friendly little old man shook it heartily, and after a
little shower of caution, he took his umbrella, and fumbled his way out
of the room.
 
George stood thoughtfully looking at the door, as the old man closed it.
A thought seemed to flash across his mind. He hastily stepped to it, and
opening it, said,
 
"Mr. Wilson, one word more."
 
The old gentleman entered again, and George, as before, locked the door,
and then stood for a few moments looking on the floor, irresolutely. At
last, raising his head with a sudden effort"Mr. Wilson, you have shown
yourself a Christian in your treatment of me,I want to ask one last
deed of Christian kindness of you."
 
"Well, George."
 
"Well, sir,what you said was true. I _am_ running a dreadful risk.
There isnt, on earth, a living soul to care if I die," he added,
drawing his breath hard, and speaking with a great effort,"I shall
be kicked out and buried like a dog, and nobodyll think of it a day
after,_only my poor wife!_ Poor soul! shell mourn and grieve and
if youd only contrive, Mr. Wilson, to send this little pin to her. She
gave it to me for a Christmas present, poor child! Give it to her,
and tell her I loved her to the last. Will you? _Will_ you?" he added,
earnestly.
 
"Yes, certainlypoor fellow!" said the old gentleman, taking the pin,
with watery eyes, and a melancholy quiver in his voice.
 
"Tell her one thing," said George "its my last wish, if she _can_ get
to Canada, to go there. No matter how kind her mistress is,no matter
how much she loves her home beg her not to go back,for slavery always
ends in misery. Tell her to bring up our boy a free man, and then he
wont suffer as I have. Tell her this, Mr. Wilson, will you?"
 
"Yes, George. Ill tell her but I trust you wont die take
heart,youre a brave fellow. Trust in the Lord, George. I wish in my
heart you were safe through, though,thats what I do."
 
"_Is_ there a God to trust in?" said George, in such a tone of bitter
despair as arrested the old gentlemans words. "O, Ive seen things all
my life that have made me feel that there cant be a God. You Christians
dont know how these things look to us. Theres a God for you, but is
there any for us?"
 
"O, now, dontdont, my boy!" said the old man, almost sobbing as
he spoke "dont feel so! There isthere is clouds and darkness are
around about him, but righteousness and judgment are the habitation of
his throne. Theres a _God_, George,believe it trust in Him, and Im
sure Hell help you. Everything will be set right,if not in this life,
in another."
 
The real piety and benevolence of the simple old man invested him with
a temporary dignity and authority, as he spoke. George stopped his
distracted walk up and down the room, stood thoughtfully a moment, and
then said, quietly,
 
"Thank you for saying that, my good friend Ill _think of that_."
 
 
 
CHAPTER XII
 
Select Incident of Lawful Trade
 
 
"In Ramah there was a voice heard,weeping, and lamentation, and great
mourning Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted."
 
      Jer. 3115.
 
Mr. Haley and Tom jogged onward in their wagon, each, for a time,
absorbed in his own reflections. Now, the reflections of two men sitting
side by side are a curious thing,seated on the same seat, having the
same eyes, ears, hands and organs of all sorts, and having pass before
their eyes the same objects,it is wonderful what a variety we shall
find in these same reflections!
 
As, for example, Mr. Haley he thought first of Toms length, and
breadth, and height, and what he would sell for, if he was kept fat and
in good case till he got him into market. He thought of how he should
make out his gang he thought of the respective market value of certain
supposititious men and women and children who were to compose it, and
other kindred topics of the business then he thought of himself, and
how humane he was, that whereas other men chained their "niggers" hand
and foot both, he only put fetters on the feet, and left Tom the use
of his hands, as long as he behaved well and he sighed to think how
ungrateful human nature was, so that there was even room to doubt
whether Tom appreciated his mercies. He had been taken in so by
"niggers" whom he had favored but still he was astonished to consider
how goodnatured he yet remained!
 
As to Tom, he was thinking over some words of an unfashionable old book,
which kept running through his head, again and again, as follows "We
have here no continuing city, but we seek one to come wherefore God
himself is not ashamed to be called our God for he hath prepared for
us a city." These words of an ancient volume, got up principally by
"ignorant and unlearned men," have, through all time, kept up, somehow,
a strange sort of power over the minds of poor, simple fellows, like
Tom. They stir up the soul from its depths, and rouse, as with trumpet
call, courage, energy, and enthusiasm, where before was only the
blackness of despair.
 
Mr. Haley pulled out of his pocket sundry newspapers, and began
looking over their advertisements, with absorbed interest. He was not a
remarkably fluent reader, and was in the habit of reading in a sort
of recitative halfaloud, by way of calling in his ears to verify the
deductions of his eyes. In this tone he slowly recited the following
paragraph
 
 
"EXECUTORS SALE,NEGROES!Agreeably to order of court, will be sold,
on Tuesday, February 20, before the Courthouse door, in the town of
Washington, Kentucky, the following negroes Hagar, aged 60 John, aged
30 Ben, aged 21 Saul, aged 25 Albert, aged 14. Sold for the benefit
of the creditors and heirs of the estate of Jesse Blutchford,
 
"SAMUEL MORRIS, THOMAS FLINT, _Executors_."
 
 
"This yer I must look at," said he to Tom, for want of somebody else to
talk to.
 
"Ye see, Im going to get up a prime gang to take down with ye, Tom
itll make it sociable and pleasant like,good company will, ye know.
We must drive right to Washington first and foremost, and then Ill clap
you into jail, while I does the business."
 
Tom received this agreeable intelligence quite meekly simply wondering,
in his own heart, how many of these doomed men had wives and children,
and whether they would feel as he did about leaving them. It is to be
confessed, too, that the naive, offhand information that he was to be
thrown into jail by no means produced an agreeable impression on a poor
fellow who had always prided himself on a strictly honest and upright
course of life. Yes, Tom, we must confess it, was rather proud of his
honesty, poor fellow,not having very much else to be proud ofif he
had belonged to some of the higher walks of society, he, perhaps, would
never have been reduced to such straits. However, the day wore on,
and the evening saw Haley and Tom comfortably accommodated in
Washington,the one in a tavern, and the other in a jail.
 
About eleven oclock the next day, a mixed throng was gathered around
the courthouse steps,smoking, chewing, spitting, swearing, and
conversing, according to their respective tastes and turns,waiting
for the auction to commence. The men and women to be sold sat in a
group apart, talking in a low tone to each other. The woman who had been
advertised by the name of Hagar was a regular African in feature and
figure. She might have been sixty, but was older than that by hard work
and disease, was partially blind, and somewhat crippled with rheumatism.
By her side stood her only remaining son, Albert, a brightlooking
little fellow of fourteen years. The boy was the only survivor of a
large family, who had been successively sold away from her to a southern
market. The mother held on to him with both her shaking hands, and eyed
with intense trepidation every one who walked up to examine him.
 
"Dont be feard, Aunt Hagar," said the oldest of the men, "I spoke to
Masr Thomas bout it, and he thought he might manage to sell you in a
lot both together."
 
"Dey neednt call me worn out yet," said she, lifting her shaking hands.
"I can cook yet, and scrub, and scour,Im wuth a buying, if I do come
cheaptell em dat ar,you _tell_ em," she added, earnestly.
 
Haley here forced his way into the group, walked up to the old man,
pulled his mouth open and looked in, felt of his teeth, made him stand
and straighten himself, bend his back, and perform various evolutions
to show his muscles and then passed on to the next, and put him
through the same trial. Walking up last to the boy, he felt of his arms,
straightened his hands, and looked at his fingers, and made him jump, to
show his agility.
 
"He ant gwine to be sold widout me!" said the old woman, with
passionate eagerness "he and I goes in a lot together I s rail strong
yet, Masr and can do heaps o work,heaps on it, Masr."
 
"On plantation?" said Haley, with a contemptuous glance. "Likely story!"
and, as if satisfied with his examination, he walked out and looked, and
stood with his hands in his pocket, his cigar in his mouth, and his hat
cocked on one side, ready for action.
 
"What think of em?" said a man who had been following Haleys
examination, as if to make up his own mind from it.
 
"Wal," said Haley, spitting, "I shall put in, I think, for the youngerly
ones and the boy."
 
"They want to sell the boy and the old woman together," said the man.
 
"Find it a tight pullwhy, shes an old rack o bones,not worth her
salt."
 
"You wouldnt then?" said the man.
 
"Anybody d be a fool t would. Shes half blind, crooked with
rheumatis, and foolish to boot."
 
"Some buys up these yer old critturs, and ses theres a sight more wear
in em than a body d think," said the man, reflectively.
 
"No go, t all," said Haley "wouldnt take her for a
present,fact,Ive _seen_, now."
 
"Wal, t is kinder pity, now, not to buy her with her son,her heart
seems so sot on him,spose they fling her in cheap."
 
"Them thats got money to spend that ar way, its all well enough.
I shall bid off on that ar boy for a plantationhandwouldnt be
bothered with her, no way, not if theyd give her to me," said Haley.
 
"Shell take on despt," said the man.
 
"Natlly, she will," said the trader, coolly.
 
The conversation was here interrupted by a busy hum in the audience
and the auctioneer, a short, bustling, important fellow, elbowed his
way into the crowd. The old woman drew in her breath, and caught
instinctively at her son.
 
"Keep close to yer mammy, Albert,close,deyll put us up togedder,"
she said.
 
"O, mammy, Im feard they wont," said the boy.
 
"Dey must, child I cant live, no ways, if they dont" said the old
creature, vehemently.
 
The stentorian tones of the auctioneer, calling out to clear the way,
now announced that the sale was about to commence. A place was cleared,
and the bidding began. The different men on the list were soon knocked
off at prices which showed a pretty brisk demand in the market two of
them fell to Haley.
 
"Come, now, young un," said the auctioneer, giving the boy a touch with
his hammer, "be up and show your springs, now."
 
"Put us two up togedder, togedder,do please, Masr," said the old
woman, holding fast to her boy.
 
"Be off," said the man, gruffly, pushing her hands away "you come last.
Now, darkey, spring" and, with the word, he pushed the boy toward the
block, while a deep, heavy groan rose behind him. The boy paused, and
looked back but there was no time to stay, and, dashing the tears from
his large, bright eyes, he was up in a moment.
 
His fine figure, alert limbs, and bright face, raised an instant
competition, and half a dozen bids simultaneously met the ear of the
auctioneer. Anxious, halffrightened, he looked from side to side, as
he heard the clatter of contending bids,now here, now there,till the
hammer fell. Haley had got him. He was pushed from the block toward his
new master, but stopped one moment, and looked back, when his poor old
mother, trembling in every limb, held out her shaking hands toward him.
 
"Buy me too, Masr, for de dear Lords sake!buy me,I shall die if
you dont!"
 
"Youll die if I do, thats the kink of it," said Haley,"no!" And he
turned on his heel.
 
The bidding for the poor old creature was summary. The man who had
addressed Haley, and who seemed not destitute of compassion, bought her
for a trifle, and the spectators began to disperse.
 
The poor victims of the sale, who had been brought up in one place
together for years, gathered round the despairing old mother, whose
agony was pitiful to see.
 
"Couldnt dey leave me one? Masr allers said I should have one,he
did," she repeated over and over, in heartbroken tones.
 
"Trust in the Lord, Aunt Hagar," said the oldest of the men,
sorrowfully.
 
"What good will it do?" said she, sobbing passionately.
 
"Mother, mother,dont! dont!" said the boy. "They say you s got a
good master."
 
"I dont care,I dont care. O, Albert! oh, my boy! you s my last
baby. Lord, how ken I?"
 
"Come, take her off, cant some of ye?" said Haley, dryly "dont do no
good for her to go on that ar way."
 
The old men of the company, partly by persuasion and partly by force,
loosed the poor creatures last despairing hold, and, as they led her
off to her new masters wagon, strove to comfort her.
 
"Now!" said Haley, pushing his three purchases together, and producing
a bundle of handcuffs, which he proceeded to put on their wrists and
fastening each handcuff to a long chain, he drove them before him to the
jail.
 
A few days saw Haley, with his possessions, safely deposited on one of
the Ohio boats. It was the commencement of his gang, to be augmented, as
the boat moved on, by various other merchandise of the same kind, which
he, or his agent, had stored for him in various points along shore.
 
The La Belle Riviere, as brave and beautiful a boat as ever walked the
waters of her namesake river, was floating gayly down the stream,
under a brilliant sky, the stripes and stars of free America waving and
fluttering over head the guards crowded with welldressed ladies and
gentlemen walking and enjoying the delightful day. All was full of life,
buoyant and rejoicingall but Haleys gang, who were stored, with
other freight, on the lower deck, and who, somehow, did not seem to
appreciate their various privileges, as they sat in a knot, talking to
each other in low tones.
 
"Boys," said Haley, coming up, briskly, "I hope you keep up good heart,
and are cheerful. Now, no sulks, ye see keep stiff upper lip, boys do
well by me, and Ill do well by you."
 
The boys addressed responded the invariable "Yes, Masr," for ages
the watchword of poor Africa but its to be owned they did not look
particularly cheerful they had their various little prejudices in favor
of wives, mothers, sisters, and children, seen for the last time,and
though "they that wasted them required of them mirth," it was not
instantly forthcoming.
 
"Ive got a wife," spoke out the article enumerated as "John, aged
thirty," and he laid his chained hand on Toms knee,"and she dont
know a word about this, poor girl!"
 
"Where does she live?" said Tom.
 
"In a tavern a piece down here," said John "I wish, now, I _could_ see
her once more in this world," he added.
 
Poor John! It _was_ rather natural and the tears that fell, as he
spoke, came as naturally as if he had been a white man. Tom drew a long
breath from a sore heart, and tried, in his poor way, to comfort him.
 
And over head, in the cabin, sat fathers and mothers, husbands and
wives and merry, dancing children moved round among them, like so
many little butterflies, and everything was going on quite easy and
comfortable.
 
"O, mamma," said a boy, who had just come up from below, "theres a
negro trader on board, and hes brought four or five slaves down there."
 
"Poor creatures!" said the mother, in a tone between grief and
indignation.
 
"Whats that?" said another lady.
 
"Some poor slaves below," said the mother.
 
"And theyve got chains on," said the boy.
 
"What a shame to our country that such sights are to be seen!" said
another lady.
 
"O, theres a great deal to be said on both sides of the subject," said
a genteel woman, who sat at her stateroom door sewing, while her little
girl and boy were playing round her. "Ive been south, and I must say I
think the negroes are better off than they would be to be free."
 
"In some respects, some of them are well off, I grant," said the lady to
whose remark she had answered. "The most dreadful part of slavery, to my
mind, is its outrages on the feelings and affections,the separating of
families, for example."
 
"That _is_ a bad thing, certainly," said the other lady, holding up
a babys dress she had just completed, and looking intently on its
trimmings "but then, I fancy, it dont occur often."
 
"O, it does," said the first lady, eagerly "Ive lived many years in
Kentucky and Virginia both, and Ive seen enough to make any ones heart
sick. Suppose, maam, your two children, there, should be taken from
you, and sold?"
 
"We cant reason from our feelings to those of this class of persons,"
said the other lady, sorting out some worsteds on her lap.
 
"Indeed, maam, you can know nothing of them, if you say so," answered
the first lady, warmly. "I was born and brought up among them. I know
they _do_ feel, just as keenly,even more so, perhaps,as we do."
 
The lady said "Indeed!" yawned, and looked out the cabin window,
and finally repeated, for a finale, the remark with which she had
begun,"After all, I think they are better off than they would be to be
free."
 
"Its undoubtedly the intention of Providence that the African race
should be servants,kept in a low condition," said a gravelooking
gentleman in black, a clergyman, seated by the cabin door. "Cursed be
Canaan a servant of servants shall he be, the scripture says."
 
      Gen. 925.  This is what Noah says when he wakes out of
     drunkenness and realizes that his youngest son, Ham, father
     of Canaan, has seen him naked.
 
"I say, stranger, is that ar what that text means?" said a tall man,
standing by.
 
"Undoubtedly. It pleased Providence, for some inscrutable reason, to
doom the race to bondage, ages ago and we must not set up our opinion
against that."
 
"Well, then, well all go ahead and buy up niggers," said the man, "if
thats the way of Providence,wont we, Squire?" said he, turning to
Haley, who had been standing, with his hands in his pockets, by the
stove and intently listening to the conversation.
 
"Yes," continued the tall man, "we must all be resigned to the decrees
of Providence. Niggers must be sold, and trucked round, and kept
under its what theys made for. Pears like this yer view s quite
refreshing, ant it, stranger?" said he to Haley.
 
"I never thought on t," said Haley, "I couldnt have said as much,
myself I hant no larning. I took up the trade just to make a living
if tant right, I calculated to pent on t in time, ye know."
 
"And now youll save yerself the trouble, wont ye?" said the tall man.
"See what t is, now, to know scripture. If yed only studied yer Bible,
like this yer good man, ye might have knowd it before, and saved ye
a heap o trouble. Ye could jist have said, Cussed bewhats his
name?and t would all have come right." And the stranger, who was
no other than the honest drover whom we introduced to our readers in the
Kentucky tavern, sat down, and began smoking, with a curious smile on
his long, dry face.
 
A tall, slender young man, with a face expressive of great feeling
and intelligence, here broke in, and repeated the words, "All things
whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto
them. I suppose," he added, "_that_ is scripture, as much as Cursed be
Canaan."
 
"Wal, it seems quite _as_ plain a text, stranger," said John the drover,
"to poor fellows like us, now" and John smoked on like a volcano.
 
The young man paused, looked as if he was going to say more, when
suddenly the boat stopped, and the company made the usual steamboat
rush, to see where they were landing.
 
"Both them ar chaps parsons?" said John to one of the men, as they were
going out.
 
The man nodded.
 
As the boat stopped, a black woman came running wildly up the plank,
darted into the crowd, flew up to where the slave gang sat, and
threw her arms round that unfortunate piece of merchandise before
enumerate"John, aged thirty," and with sobs and tears bemoaned him as
her husband.
 
But what needs tell the story, told too oft,every day told,of
heartstrings rent and broken,the weak broken and torn for the profit
and convenience of the strong! It needs not to be toldevery day is
telling it,telling it, too, in the ear of One who is not deaf, though
he be long silent.
 
The young man who had spoken for the cause of humanity and God before
stood with folded arms, looking on this scene. He turned, and Haley
was standing at his side. "My friend," he said, speaking with thick
utterance, "how can you, how dare you, carry on a trade like this? Look
at those poor creatures! Here I am, rejoicing in my heart that I am
going home to my wife and child and the same bell which is a signal
to carry me onward towards them will part this poor man and his wife
forever. Depend upon it, God will bring you into judgment for this."
 
The trader turned away in silence.
 
"I say, now," said the drover, touching his elbow, "theres differences
in parsons, ant there? Cussed be Canaan dont seem to go down with
this un, does it?"
 
Haley gave an uneasy growl.
 
"And that ar ant the worst on t," said John "mabbee it wont go down
with the Lord, neither, when ye come to settle with Him, one o these
days, as all on us must, I reckon."
 
Haley walked reflectively to the other end of the boat.
 
"If I make pretty handsomely on one or two next gangs," he thought, "I
reckon Ill stop off this yer its really getting dangerous." And he
took out his pocketbook, and began adding over his accounts,a process
which many gentlemen besides Mr. Haley have found a specific for an
uneasy conscience.
 
The boat swept proudly away from the shore, and all went on merrily, as
before. Men talked, and loafed, and read, and smoked. Women sewed, and
children played, and the boat passed on her way.
 
One day, when she lay to for a while at a small town in Kentucky, Haley
went up into the place on a little matter of business.
 
Tom, whose fetters did not prevent his taking a moderate circuit, had
drawn near the side of the boat, and stood listlessly gazing over the
railing. After a time, he saw the trader returning, with an alert step,
in company with a colored woman, bearing in her arms a young child. She
was dressed quite respectably, and a colored man followed her, bringing
along a small trunk. The woman came cheerfully onward, talking, as she
came, with the man who bore her trunk, and so passed up the plank into
the boat. The bell rung, the steamer whizzed, the engine groaned and
coughed, and away swept the boat down the river.
 
The woman walked forward among the boxes and bales of the lower deck,
and, sitting down, busied herself with chirruping to her baby.
 
Haley made a turn or two about the boat, and then, coming up, seated
himself near her, and began saying something to her in an indifferent
undertone.
 
Tom soon noticed a heavy cloud passing over the womans brow and that
she answered rapidly, and with great vehemence.
 
"I dont believe it,I wont believe it!" he heard her say. "Youre
jist a foolin with me."
 
"If you wont believe it, look here!" said the man, drawing out a paper
"this yers the bill of sale, and theres your masters name to it and
I paid down good solid cash for it, too, I can tell you,so, now!"
 
"I dont believe Masr would cheat me so it cant be true!" said the
woman, with increasing agitation.
 
"You can ask any of these men here, that can read writing. Here!" he
said, to a man that was passing by, "jist read this yer, wont you! This
yer gal wont believe me, when I tell her what t is."
 
"Why, its a bill of sale, signed by John Fosdick," said the man,
"making over to you the girl Lucy and her child. Its all straight
enough, for aught I see."
 
The womans passionate exclamations collected a crowd around her, and
the trader briefly explained to them the cause of the agitation.
 
"He told me that I was going down to Louisville, to hire out as cook to
the same tavern where my husband works,thats what Masr told me, his
own self and I cant believe hed lie to me," said the woman.
 
"But he has sold you, my poor woman, theres no doubt about it," said
a goodnatured looking man, who had been examining the papers "he has
done it, and no mistake."
 
"Then its no account talking," said the woman, suddenly growing quite
calm and, clasping her child tighter in her arms, she sat down on her
box, turned her back round, and gazed listlessly into the river.
 
"Going to take it easy, after all!" said the trader. "Gals got grit, I
see."
 
The woman looked calm, as the boat went on and a beautiful soft summer
breeze passed like a compassionate spirit over her head,the gentle
breeze, that never inquires whether the brow is dusky or fair that it
fans. And she saw sunshine sparkling on the water, in golden ripples,
and heard gay voices, full of ease and pleasure, talking around her
everywhere but her heart lay as if a great stone had fallen on it.
Her baby raised himself up against her, and stroked her cheeks with his
little hands and, springing up and down, crowing and chatting, seemed
determined to arouse her. She strained him suddenly and tightly in
her arms, and slowly one tear after another fell on his wondering,
unconscious face and gradually she seemed, and little by little, to
grow calmer, and busied herself with tending and nursing him.
 
The child, a boy of ten months, was uncommonly large and strong of his
age, and very vigorous in his limbs. Never, for a moment, still, he kept
his mother constantly busy in holding him, and guarding his springing
activity.
 
"Thats a fine chap!" said a man, suddenly stopping opposite to him,
with his hands in his pockets. "How old is he?"
 
"Ten months and a half," said the mother.
 
The man whistled to the boy, and offered him part of a stick of candy,
which he eagerly grabbed at, and very soon had it in a babys general
depository, to wit, his mouth.
 
"Rum fellow!" said the man "Knows whats what!" and he whistled, and
walked on. When he had got to the other side of the boat, he came across
Haley, who was smoking on top of a pile of boxes.
 
The stranger produced a match, and lighted a cigar, saying, as he did
so,
 
"Decentish kind o wench youve got round there, stranger."
 
"Why, I reckon she _is_ tolable fair," said Haley, blowing the smoke
out of his mouth.
 
"Taking her down south?" said the man.
 
Haley nodded, and smoked on.
 
"Plantation hand?" said the man.
 
"Wal," said Haley, "Im fillin out an order for a plantation, and I
think I shall put her in. They telled me she was a good cook and they
can use her for that, or set her at the cottonpicking. Shes got the
right fingers for that I looked at em. Sell well, either way" and
Haley resumed his cigar.
 
"They wont want the young un on the plantation," said the man.
 
"I shall sell him, first chance I find," said Haley, lighting another
cigar.
 
"Spose youd be selling him tolable cheap," said the stranger,
mounting the pile of boxes, and sitting down comfortably.
 
"Dont know bout that," said Haley "hes a pretty smart young un,
straight, fat, strong flesh as hard as a brick!"
 
"Very true, but then theres the bother and expense of raisin."
 
"Nonsense!" said Haley "they is raised as easy as any kind of critter
there is going they ant a bit more trouble than pups. This yer chap
will be running all around, in a month."
 
"Ive got a good place for raisin, and I thought of takin in a little
more stock," said the man. "One cook lost a young un last week,got
drownded in a washtub, while she was a hangin out the clothes,and I
reckon it would be well enough to set her to raisin this yer."
 
Haley and the stranger smoked a while in silence, neither seeming
willing to broach the test question of the interview. At last the man
resumed
 
"You wouldnt think of wantin more than ten dollars for that ar chap,
seeing you _must_ get him off yer hand, any how?"
 
Haley shook his head, and spit impressively.
 
"That wont do, no ways," he said, and began his smoking again.
 
"Well, stranger, what will you take?"
 
"Well, now," said Haley, "I _could_ raise that ar chap myself, or get
him raised hes oncommon likely and healthy, and hed fetch a hundred
dollars, six months hence and, in a year or two, hed bring two
hundred, if I had him in the right spot I shant take a cent less nor
fifty for him now."
 
"O, stranger! thats rediculous, altogether," said the man.
 
"Fact!" said Haley, with a decisive nod of his head.
 
"Ill give thirty for him," said the stranger, "but not a cent more."
 
"Now, Ill tell ye what I will do," said Haley, spitting again, with
renewed decision. "Ill split the difference, and say fortyfive and
thats the most I will do."
 
"Well, agreed!" said the man, after an interval.
 
"Done!" said Haley. "Where do you land?"
 
"At Louisville," said the man.
 
"Louisville," said Haley. "Very fair, we get there about dusk. Chap will
be asleep,all fair,get him off quietly, and no screaming,happens
beautiful,I like to do everything quietly,I hates all kind of
agitation and fluster." And so, after a transfer of certain bills had
passed from the mans pocketbook to the traders, he resumed his cigar.
 
It was a bright, tranquil evening when the boat stopped at the wharf at
Louisville. The woman had been sitting with her baby in her arms, now
wrapped in a heavy sleep. When she heard the name of the place called
out, she hastily laid the child down in a little cradle formed by the
hollow among the boxes, first carefully spreading under it her cloak
and then she sprung to the side of the boat, in hopes that, among the
various hotelwaiters who thronged the wharf, she might see her husband.
In this hope, she pressed forward to the front rails, and, stretching
far over them, strained her eyes intently on the moving heads on the
shore, and the crowd pressed in between her and the child.
 
"Nows your time," said Haley, taking the sleeping child up, and handing
him to the stranger. "Dont wake him up, and set him to crying, now
it would make a devil of a fuss with the gal." The man took the bundle
carefully, and was soon lost in the crowd that went up the wharf.
 
When the boat, creaking, and groaning, and puffing, had loosed from
the wharf, and was beginning slowly to strain herself along, the woman
returned to her old seat. The trader was sitting there,the child was
gone!
 
"Why, why,where?" she began, in bewildered surprise.
 
"Lucy," said the trader, "your childs gone you may as well know it
first as last. You see, I knowd you couldnt take him down south and
I got a chance to sell him to a firstrate family, thatll raise him
better than you can."
 
The trader had arrived at that stage of Christian and political
perfection which has been recommended by some preachers and politicians
of the north, lately, in which he had completely overcome every humane
weakness and prejudice. His heart was exactly where yours, sir, and mine
could be brought, with proper effort and cultivation. The wild look
of anguish and utter despair that the woman cast on him might have
disturbed one less practised but he was used to it. He had seen that
same look hundreds of times. You can get used to such things, too, my
friend and it is the great object of recent efforts to make our whole
northern community used to them, for the glory of the Union. So the
trader only regarded the mortal anguish which he saw working in those
dark features, those clenched hands, and suffocating breathings, as
necessary incidents of the trade, and merely calculated whether she was
going to scream, and get up a commotion on the boat for, like other
supporters of our peculiar institution, he decidedly disliked agitation.
 
But the woman did not scream. The shot had passed too straight and
direct through the heart, for cry or tear.
 
Dizzily she sat down. Her slack hands fell lifeless by her side. Her
eyes looked straight forward, but she saw nothing. All the noise and
hum of the boat, the groaning of the machinery, mingled dreamily to her
bewildered ear and the poor, dumbstricken heart had neither cry not
tear to show for its utter misery. She was quite calm.
 
The trader, who, considering his advantages, was almost as humane as
some of our politicians, seemed to feel called on to administer such
consolation as the case admitted of.
 
"I know this yer comes kinder hard, at first, Lucy," said he "but such
a smart, sensible gal as you are, wont give way to it. You see its
_necessary_, and cant be helped!"
 
"O! dont, Masr, dont!" said the woman, with a voice like one that is
smothering.
 
"Youre a smart wench, Lucy," he persisted "I mean to do well by
ye, and get ye a nice place down river and youll soon get another
husband,such a likely gal as you"
 
"O! Masr, if you _only_ wont talk to me now," said the woman, in a
voice of such quick and living anguish that the trader felt that there
was something at present in the case beyond his style of operation. He
got up, and the woman turned away, and buried her head in her cloak.
 
The trader walked up and down for a time, and occasionally stopped and
looked at her.
 
"Takes it hard, rather," he soliloquized, "but quiet, tholet her
sweat a while shell come right, by and by!"
 
Tom had watched the whole transaction from first to last, and had a
perfect understanding of its results. To him, it looked like something
unutterably horrible and cruel, because, poor, ignorant black soul! he
had not learned to generalize, and to take enlarged views. If he had
only been instructed by certain ministers of Christianity, he might have
thought better of it, and seen in it an everyday incident of a lawful
trade a trade which is the vital support of an institution which an
American divine tells us has _"no evils but such as are inseparable
from any other relations in social and domestic life_." But Tom, as
we see, being a poor, ignorant fellow, whose reading had been confined
entirely to the New Testament, could not comfort and solace himself with
views like these. His very soul bled within him for what seemed to him
the _wrongs_ of the poor suffering thing that lay like a crushed reed
on the boxes the feeling, living, bleeding, yet immortal _thing_,
which American state law coolly classes with the bundles, and bales, and
boxes, among which she is lying.

     family. Mrs. Stowe attempted unsuccessfully to have this
     identifying note removed from the stereotypeplate of the
     first edition.
 
Tom drew near, and tried to say something but she only groaned.
Honestly, and with tears running down his own cheeks, he spoke of a
heart of love in the skies, of a pitying Jesus, and an eternal home but
the ear was deaf with anguish, and the palsied heart could not feel.
 
Night came on,night calm, unmoved, and glorious, shining down with
her innumerable and solemn angel eyes, twinkling, beautiful, but silent.
There was no speech nor language, no pitying voice or helping hand, from
that distant sky. One after another, the voices of business or pleasure
died away all on the boat were sleeping, and the ripples at the prow
were plainly heard. Tom stretched himself out on a box, and there, as he
lay, he heard, ever and anon, a smothered sob or cry from the prostrate
creature,"O! what shall I do? O Lord! O good Lord, do help me!" and
so, ever and anon, until the murmur died away in silence.
 
At midnight, Tom waked, with a sudden start. Something black passed
quickly by him to the side of the boat, and he heard a splash in the
water. No one else saw or heard anything. He raised his head,the
womans place was vacant! He got up, and sought about him in vain.
The poor bleeding heart was still, at last, and the river rippled and
dimpled just as brightly as if it had not closed above it.
 
Patience! patience! ye whose hearts swell indignant at wrongs like
these. Not one throb of anguish, not one tear of the oppressed, is
forgotten by the Man of Sorrows, the Lord of Glory. In his patient,
generous bosom he bears the anguish of a world. Bear thou, like him,
in patience, and labor in love for sure as he is God, "the year of his
redeemed _shall_ come."
 
The trader waked up bright and early, and came out to see to his live
stock. It was now his turn to look about in perplexity.
 
"Where alive is that gal?" he said to Tom.
 
Tom, who had learned the wisdom of keeping counsel, did not feel called
upon to state his observations and suspicions, but said he did not know.
 
"She surely couldnt have got off in the night at any of the landings,
for I was awake, and on the lookout, whenever the boat stopped. I never
trust these yer things to other folks."
 
This speech was addressed to Tom quite confidentially, as if it was
something that would be specially interesting to him. Tom made no
answer.
 
The trader searched the boat from stem to stern, among boxes, bales and
barrels, around the machinery, by the chimneys, in vain.
 
"Now, I say, Tom, be fair about this yer," he said, when, after a
fruitless search, he came where Tom was standing. "You know something
about it, now. Dont tell me,I know you do. I saw the gal stretched
out here about ten oclock, and agin at twelve, and agin between one
and two and then at four she was gone, and you was a sleeping right
there all the time. Now, you know something,you cant help it."
 
"Well, Masr," said Tom, "towards morning something brushed by me, and I
kinder half woke and then I hearn a great splash, and then I clare woke
up, and the gal was gone. Thats all I know on t."
 
The trader was not shocked nor amazed because, as we said before, he
was used to a great many things that you are not used to. Even the awful
presence of Death struck no solemn chill upon him. He had seen Death
many times,met him in the way of trade, and got acquainted with
him,and he only thought of him as a hard customer, that embarrassed
his property operations very unfairly and so he only swore that the
gal was a baggage, and that he was devilish unlucky, and that, if things
went on in this way, he should not make a cent on the trip. In short, he
seemed to consider himself an illused man, decidedly but there was no
help for it, as the woman had escaped into a state which _never will_
give up a fugitive,not even at the demand of the whole glorious
Union. The trader, therefore, sat discontentedly down, with his little
accountbook, and put down the missing body and soul under the head of
_losses!_
 
"Hes a shocking creature, isnt he,this trader? so unfeeling! Its
dreadful, really!"
 
"O, but nobody thinks anything of these traders! They are universally
despised,never received into any decent society."
 
But who, sir, makes the trader? Who is most to blame? The enlightened,
cultivated, intelligent man, who supports the system of which the trader
is the inevitable result, or the poor trader himself? You make the
public statement that calls for his trade, that debauches and depraves
him, till he feels no shame in it and in what are you better than he?
 
Are you educated and he ignorant, you high and he low, you refined and
he coarse, you talented and he simple?
 
In the day of a future judgment, these very considerations may make it
more tolerable for him than for you.
 
In concluding these little incidents of lawful trade, we must beg the
world not to think that American legislators are entirely destitute of
humanity, as might, perhaps, be unfairly inferred from the great efforts
made in our national body to protect and perpetuate this species of
traffic.
 
Who does not know how our great men are outdoing themselves, in
declaiming against the _foreign_ slavetrade. There are a perfect host
of Clarksons and Wilberforces risen up among us on that subject, most
edifying to hear and behold. Trading negroes from Africa, dear reader,
is so horrid! It is not to be thought of! But trading them from
Kentucky,thats quite another thing!

CHAPTER XIII
 
The Quaker Settlement
 
 
A quiet scene now rises before us. A large, roomy, neatlypainted
kitchen, its yellow floor glossy and smooth, and without a particle
of dust a neat, wellblacked cookingstove rows of shining tin,
suggestive of unmentionable good things to the appetite glossy green
wood chairs, old and firm a small flagbottomed rockingchair, with
a patchwork cushion in it, neatly contrived out of small pieces of
different colored woollen goods, and a larger sized one, motherly and
old, whose wide arms breathed hospitable invitation, seconded by the
solicitation of its feather cushions,a real comfortable, persuasive
old chair, and worth, in the way of honest, homely enjoyment, a dozen of
your plush or _brochetelle_ drawingroom gentry and in the chair, gently
swaying back and forward, her eyes bent on some fine sewing, sat our
fine old friend Eliza. Yes, there she is, paler and thinner than in her
Kentucky home, with a world of quiet sorrow lying under the shadow of
her long eyelashes, and marking the outline of her gentle mouth! It
was plain to see how old and firm the girlish heart was grown under
the discipline of heavy sorrow and when, anon, her large dark eye was
raised to follow the gambols of her little Harry, who was sporting, like
some tropical butterfly, hither and thither over the floor, she showed a
depth of firmness and steady resolve that was never there in her earlier
and happier days.
 
By her side sat a woman with a bright tin pan in her lap, into which
she was carefully sorting some dried peaches. She might be fiftyfive or
sixty but hers was one of those faces that time seems to touch only
to brighten and adorn. The snowy lisse crape cap, made after the strait
Quaker pattern,the plain white muslin handkerchief, lying in placid
folds across her bosom,the drab shawl and dress,showed at once the
community to which she belonged. Her face was round and rosy, with
a healthful downy softness, suggestive of a ripe peach. Her hair,
partially silvered by age, was parted smoothly back from a high placid
forehead, on which time had written no inscription, except peace on
earth, good will to men, and beneath shone a large pair of clear,
honest, loving brown eyes you only needed to look straight into them,
to feel that you saw to the bottom of a heart as good and true as ever
throbbed in womans bosom. So much has been said and sung of beautiful
young girls, why dont somebody wake up to the beauty of old women? If
any want to get up an inspiration under this head, we refer them to
our good friend Rachel Halliday, just as she sits there in her little
rockingchair. It had a turn for quacking and squeaking,that chair
had,either from having taken cold in early life, or from some
asthmatic affection, or perhaps from nervous derangement but, as she
gently swung backward and forward, the chair kept up a kind of subdued
"creechy crawchy," that would have been intolerable in any other chair.
But old Simeon Halliday often declared it was as good as any music to
him, and the children all avowed that they wouldnt miss of hearing
mothers chair for anything in the world. For why? for twenty years
or more, nothing but loving words, and gentle moralities, and motherly
loving kindness, had come from that chairheadaches and heartaches
innumerable had been cured there,difficulties spiritual and temporal
solved there,all by one good, loving woman, God bless her!
 
"And so thee still thinks of going to Canada, Eliza?" she said, as she
was quietly looking over her peaches.
 
"Yes, maam," said Eliza, firmly. "I must go onward. I dare not stop."
 
"And whatll thee do, when thee gets there? Thee must think about that,
my daughter."
 
"My daughter" came naturally from the lips of Rachel Halliday for hers
was just the face and form that made "mother" seem the most natural word
in the world.
 
Elizas hands trembled, and some tears fell on her fine work but she
answered, firmly,
 
"I shall doanything I can find. I hope I can find something."
 
"Thee knows thee can stay here, as long as thee pleases," said Rachel.
 
"O, thank you," said Eliza, "but"she pointed to Harry"I cant sleep
nights I cant rest. Last night I dreamed I saw that man coming into
the yard," she said, shuddering.
 
"Poor child!" said Rachel, wiping her eyes "but thee mustnt feel so.
The Lord hath ordered it so that never hath a fugitive been stolen from
our village. I trust thine will not be the first."
 
The door here opened, and a little short, round, pincushiony woman
stood at the door, with a cheery, blooming face, like a ripe apple. She
was dressed, like Rachel, in sober gray, with the muslin folded neatly
across her round, plump little chest.
 
"Ruth Stedman," said Rachel, coming joyfully forward "how is thee,
Ruth? she said, heartily taking both her hands.
 
"Nicely," said Ruth, taking off her little drab bonnet, and dusting it
with her handkerchief, displaying, as she did so, a round little head,
on which the Quaker cap sat with a sort of jaunty air, despite all the
stroking and patting of the small fat hands, which were busily applied
to arranging it. Certain stray locks of decidedly curly hair, too, had
escaped here and there, and had to be coaxed and cajoled into
their place again and then the new comer, who might have been
fiveandtwenty, turned from the small lookingglass, before which she
had been making these arrangements, and looked well pleased,as most
people who looked at her might have been,for she was decidedly a
wholesome, wholehearted, chirruping little woman, as ever gladdened
mans heart withal.
 
"Ruth, this friend is Eliza Harris and this is the little boy I told
thee of."
 
"I am glad to see thee, Eliza,very," said Ruth, shaking hands, as if
Eliza were an old friend she had long been expecting "and this is thy
dear boy,I brought a cake for him," she said, holding out a little
heart to the boy, who came up, gazing through his curls, and accepted it
shyly.
 
"Wheres thy baby, Ruth?" said Rachel.
 
"O, hes coming but thy Mary caught him as I came in, and ran off with
him to the barn, to show him to the children."
 
At this moment, the door opened, and Mary, an honest, rosylooking girl,
with large brown eyes, like her mothers, came in with the baby.
 
"Ah! ha!" said Rachel, coming up, and taking the great, white, fat
fellow in her arms, "how good he looks, and how he does grow!"
 
"To be sure, he does," said little bustling Ruth, as she took the child,
and began taking off a little blue silk hood, and various layers and
wrappers of outer garments and having given a twitch here, and a pull
there, and variously adjusted and arranged him, and kissed him heartily,
she set him on the floor to collect his thoughts. Baby seemed quite used
to this mode of proceeding, for he put his thumb in his mouth as if
it were quite a thing of course, and seemed soon absorbed in his own
reflections, while the mother seated herself, and taking out a long
stocking of mixed blue and white yarn, began to knit with briskness.
 
"Mary, theed better fill the kettle, hadnt thee?" gently suggested the
mother.
 
Mary took the kettle to the well, and soon reappearing, placed it over
the stove, where it was soon purring and steaming, a sort of censer of
hospitality and good cheer. The peaches, moreover, in obedience to a few
gentle whispers from Rachel, were soon deposited, by the same hand, in a
stewpan over the fire.
 
Rachel now took down a snowy mouldingboard, and, tying on an
apron, proceeded quietly to making up some biscuits, first saying to
Mary,"Mary, hadnt thee better tell John to get a chicken ready?" and
Mary disappeared accordingly.
 
"And how is Abigail Peters?" said Rachel, as she went on with her
biscuits.
 
"O, shes better," said Ruth "I was in, this morning made the bed,
tidied up the house. Leah Hills went in, this afternoon, and baked bread
and pies enough to last some days and I engaged to go back to get her
up, this evening."
 
"I will go in tomorrow, and do any cleaning there may be, and look over
the mending," said Rachel.
 
"Ah! that is well," said Ruth. "Ive heard," she added, "that Hannah
Stanwood is sick. John was up there, last night,I must go there
tomorrow."
 
"John can come in here to his meals, if thee needs to stay all day,"
suggested Rachel.
 
"Thank thee, Rachel will see, tomorrow but, here comes Simeon."
 
Simeon Halliday, a tall, straight, muscular man, in drab coat and
pantaloons, and broadbrimmed hat, now entered.
 
"How is thee, Ruth?" he said, warmly, as he spread his broad open hand
for her little fat palm "and how is John?"
 
"O! John is well, and all the rest of our folks," said Ruth, cheerily.
 
"Any news, father?" said Rachel, as she was putting her biscuits into
the oven.
 
"Peter Stebbins told me that they should be along tonight, with
_friends_," said Simeon, significantly, as he was washing his hands at a
neat sink, in a little back porch.
 
"Indeed!" said Rachel, looking thoughtfully, and glancing at Eliza.
 
"Did thee say thy name was Harris?" said Simeon to Eliza, as he
reentered.
 
Rachel glanced quickly at her husband, as Eliza tremulously answered
"yes" her fears, ever uppermost, suggesting that possibly there might
be advertisements out for her.
 
"Mother!" said Simeon, standing in the porch, and calling Rachel out.
 
"What does thee want, father?" said Rachel, rubbing her floury hands, as
she went into the porch.
 
"This childs husband is in the settlement, and will be here tonight,"
said Simeon.
 
"Now, thee doesnt say that, father?" said Rachel, all her face radiant
with joy.
 
"Its really true. Peter was down yesterday, with the wagon, to the
other stand, and there he found an old woman and two men and one said
his name was George Harris and from what he told of his history, I am
certain who he is. He is a bright, likely fellow, too."
 
"Shall we tell her now?" said Simeon.
 
"Lets tell Ruth," said Rachel. "Here, Ruth,come here."
 
Ruth laid down her knittingwork, and was in the back porch in a moment.
 
"Ruth, what does thee think?" said Rachel. "Father says Elizas husband
is in the last company, and will be here tonight."
 
A burst of joy from the little Quakeress interrupted the speech. She
gave such a bound from the floor, as she clapped her little hands, that
two stray curls fell from under her Quaker cap, and lay brightly on her
white neckerchief.
 
"Hush thee, dear!" said Rachel, gently "hush, Ruth! Tell us, shall we
tell her now?"
 
"Now! to be sure,this very minute. Why, now, suppose t was my John,
how should I feel? Do tell her, right off."
 
"Thee uses thyself only to learn how to love thy neighbor, Ruth," said
Simeon, looking, with a beaming face, on Ruth.
 
"To be sure. Isnt it what we are made for? If I didnt love John and
the baby, I should not know how to feel for her. Come, now do tell
her,do!" and she laid her hands persuasively on Rachels arm. "Take
her into thy bedroom, there, and let me fry the chicken while thee does
it."
 
Rachel came out into the kitchen, where Eliza was sewing, and opening
the door of a small bedroom, said, gently, "Come in here with me, my
daughter I have news to tell thee."
 
The blood flushed in Elizas pale face she rose, trembling with nervous
anxiety, and looked towards her boy.
 
"No, no," said little Ruth, darting up, and seizing her hands. "Never
thee fear its good news, Eliza,go in, go in!" And she gently pushed
her to the door which closed after her and then, turning round, she
caught little Harry in her arms, and began kissing him.
 
"Theell see thy father, little one. Does thee know it? Thy father is
coming," she said, over and over again, as the boy looked wonderingly at
her.
 
Meanwhile, within the door, another scene was going on. Rachel Halliday
drew Eliza toward her, and said, "The Lord hath had mercy on thee,
daughter thy husband hath escaped from the house of bondage."
 
The blood flushed to Elizas cheek in a sudden glow, and went back to
her heart with as sudden a rush. She sat down, pale and faint.
 
"Have courage, child," said Rachel, laying her hand on her head. "He is
among friends, who will bring him here tonight."
 
"Tonight!" Eliza repeated, "tonight!" The words lost all meaning to her
her head was dreamy and confused all was mist for a moment.
 
 
When she awoke, she found herself snugly tucked up on the bed, with a
blanket over her, and little Ruth rubbing her hands with camphor. She
opened her eyes in a state of dreamy, delicious languor, such as one
who has long been bearing a heavy load, and now feels it gone, and would
rest. The tension of the nerves, which had never ceased a moment since
the first hour of her flight, had given way, and a strange feeling of
security and rest came over her and as she lay, with her large, dark
eyes open, she followed, as in a quiet dream, the motions of those about
her. She saw the door open into the other room saw the suppertable,
with its snowy cloth heard the dreamy murmur of the singing teakettle
saw Ruth tripping backward and forward, with plates of cake and saucers
of preserves, and ever and anon stopping to put a cake into Harrys
hand, or pat his head, or twine his long curls round her snowy fingers.
She saw the ample, motherly form of Rachel, as she ever and anon came to
the bedside, and smoothed and arranged something about the bedclothes,
and gave a tuck here and there, by way of expressing her goodwill
and was conscious of a kind of sunshine beaming down upon her from her
large, clear, brown eyes. She saw Ruths husband come in,saw her fly
up to him, and commence whispering very earnestly, ever and anon, with
impressive gesture, pointing her little finger toward the room. She saw
her, with the baby in her arms, sitting down to tea she saw them all
at table, and little Harry in a high chair, under the shadow of
Rachels ample wing there were low murmurs of talk, gentle tinkling of
teaspoons, and musical clatter of cups and saucers, and all mingled
in a delightful dream of rest and Eliza slept, as she had not slept
before, since the fearful midnight hour when she had taken her child and
fled through the frosty starlight.
 
She dreamed of a beautiful country,a land, it seemed to her, of
rest,green shores, pleasant islands, and beautifully glittering water
and there, in a house which kind voices told her was a home, she saw her
boy playing, free and happy child. She heard her husbands footsteps
she felt him coming nearer his arms were around her, his tears falling
on her face, and she awoke! It was no dream. The daylight had long
faded her child lay calmly sleeping by her side a candle was burning
dimly on the stand, and her husband was sobbing by her pillow.
 
 
The next morning was a cheerful one at the Quaker house. "Mother" was up
betimes, and surrounded by busy girls and boys, whom we had scarce time
to introduce to our readers yesterday, and who all moved obediently to
Rachels gentle "Thee had better," or more gentle "Hadnt thee better?"
in the work of getting breakfast for a breakfast in the luxurious
valleys of Indiana is a thing complicated and multiform, and, like
picking up the roseleaves and trimming the bushes in Paradise, asking
other hands than those of the original mother. While, therefore, John
ran to the spring for fresh water, and Simeon the second sifted meal
for corncakes, and Mary ground coffee, Rachel moved gently, and quietly
about, making biscuits, cutting up chicken, and diffusing a sort of
sunny radiance over the whole proceeding generally. If there was any
danger of friction or collision from the illregulated zeal of so many
young operators, her gentle "Come! come!" or "I wouldnt, now," was
quite sufficient to allay the difficulty. Bards have written of the
cestus of Venus, that turned the heads of all the world in successive
generations. We had rather, for our part, have the cestus of Rachel
Halliday, that kept heads from being turned, and made everything go on
harmoniously. We think it is more suited to our modern days, decidedly.
 
While all other preparations were going on, Simeon the elder stood in
his shirtsleeves before a little lookingglass in the corner, engaged
in the antipatriarchal operation of shaving. Everything went on so
sociably, so quietly, so harmoniously, in the great kitchen,it seemed
so pleasant to every one to do just what they were doing, there was such
an atmosphere of mutual confidence and good fellowship everywhere,even
the knives and forks had a social clatter as they went on to the table
and the chicken and ham had a cheerful and joyous fizzle in the pan, as
if they rather enjoyed being cooked than otherwiseand when George
and Eliza and little Harry came out, they met such a hearty, rejoicing
welcome, no wonder it seemed to them like a dream.
 
At last, they were all seated at breakfast, while Mary stood at the
stove, baking griddlecakes, which, as they gained the true exact
goldenbrown tint of perfection, were transferred quite handily to the
table.
 
Rachel never looked so truly and benignly happy as at the head of her
table. There was so much motherliness and fullheartedness even in
the way she passed a plate of cakes or poured a cup of coffee, that it
seemed to put a spirit into the food and drink she offered.
 
It was the first time that ever George had sat down on equal terms at
any white mans table and he sat down, at first, with some constraint
and awkwardness but they all exhaled and went off like fog, in the
genial morning rays of this simple, overflowing kindness.
 
This, indeed, was a home,_home_,a word that George had never yet
known a meaning for and a belief in God, and trust in his providence,
began to encircle his heart, as, with a golden cloud of protection and
confidence, dark, misanthropic, pining atheistic doubts, and fierce
despair, melted away before the light of a living Gospel, breathed in
living faces, preached by a thousand unconscious acts of love and good
will, which, like the cup of cold water given in the name of a disciple,
shall never lose their reward.
 
"Father, what if thee should get found out again?" said Simeon second,
as he buttered his cake.
 
"I should pay my fine," said Simeon, quietly.
 
"But what if they put thee in prison?"
 
"Couldnt thee and mother manage the farm?" said Simeon, smiling.
 
"Mother can do almost everything," said the boy. "But isnt it a shame
to make such laws?"
 
"Thee mustnt speak evil of thy rulers, Simeon," said his father,
gravely. "The Lord only gives us our worldly goods that we may do
justice and mercy if our rulers require a price of us for it, we must
deliver it up.
 
"Well, I hate those old slaveholders!" said the boy, who felt as
unchristian as became any modern reformer.
 
"I am surprised at thee, son," said Simeon "thy mother never taught
thee so. I would do even the same for the slaveholder as for the slave,
if the Lord brought him to my door in affliction."
 
Simeon second blushed scarlet but his mother only smiled, and said,
"Simeon is my good boy he will grow older, by and by, and then he will
be like his father."
 
"I hope, my good sir, that you are not exposed to any difficulty on our
account," said George, anxiously.
 
"Fear nothing, George, for therefore are we sent into the world. If
we would not meet trouble for a good cause, we were not worthy of our
name."
 
"But, for _me_," said George, "I could not bear it."
 
"Fear not, then, friend George it is not for thee, but for God and man,
we do it," said Simeon. "And now thou must lie by quietly this day, and
tonight, at ten oclock, Phineas Fletcher will carry thee onward to the
next stand,thee and the rest of they company. The pursuers are hard
after thee we must not delay."
 
"If that is the case, why wait till evening?" said George.
 
"Thou art safe here by daylight, for every one in the settlement is
a Friend, and all are watching. It has been found safer to travel by
night."
 
 
 
CHAPTER XIV
 
Evangeline
 
     "A young star! which shone
     Oer lifetoo sweet an image, for such glass!
     A lovely being, scarcely formed or moulded
     A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded."
 
The Mississippi! How, as by an enchanted wand, have its scenes been
changed, since Chateaubriand wrote his prosepoetic description of it,
as a river of mighty, unbroken solitudes, rolling amid undreamed wonders
of vegetable and animal existence.
 
      _In Atala or the Love and Constantcy of Two Savages in
     the Desert_ 1801 by Francois Auguste Rene, Vicomte de
     Chateaubriand 17681848.
 
But as in an hour, this river of dreams and wild romance has emerged to
a reality scarcely less visionary and splendid. What other river of the
world bears on its bosom to the ocean the wealth and enterprise of
such another country?a country whose products embrace all between the
tropics and the poles! Those turbid waters, hurrying, foaming, tearing
along, an apt resemblance of that headlong tide of business which is
poured along its wave by a race more vehement and energetic than any the
old world ever saw. Ah! would that they did not also bear along a more
fearful freight,the tears of the oppressed, the sighs of the helpless,
the bitter prayers of poor, ignorant hearts to an unknown Godunknown,
unseen and silent, but who will yet "come out of his place to save all
the poor of the earth!"
 
The slanting light of the setting sun quivers on the sealike expanse
of the river the shivery canes, and the tall, dark cypress, hung
with wreaths of dark, funereal moss, glow in the golden ray, as the
heavilyladen steamboat marches onward.
 
Piled with cottonbales, from many a plantation, up over deck and sides,
till she seems in the distance a square, massive block of gray, she
moves heavily onward to the nearing mart. We must look some time among
its crowded decks before we shall find again our humble friend Tom. High
on the upper deck, in a little nook among the everywhere predominant
cottonbales, at last we may find him.
 
Partly from confidence inspired by Mr. Shelbys representations, and
partly from the remarkably inoffensive and quiet character of the man,
Tom had insensibly won his way far into the confidence even of such a
man as Haley.
 
At first he had watched him narrowly through the day, and never allowed
him to sleep at night unfettered but the uncomplaining patience and
apparent contentment of Toms manner led him gradually to discontinue
these restraints, and for some time Tom had enjoyed a sort of parole
of honor, being permitted to come and go freely where he pleased on the
boat.
 
Ever quiet and obliging, and more than ready to lend a hand in every
emergency which occurred among the workmen below, he had won the good
opinion of all the hands, and spent many hours in helping them with as
hearty a good will as ever he worked on a Kentucky farm.
 
When there seemed to be nothing for him to do, he would climb to a nook
among the cottonbales of the upper deck, and busy himself in studying
over his Bible,and it is there we see him now.
 
For a hundred or more miles above New Orleans, the river is higher than
the surrounding country, and rolls its tremendous volume between
massive levees twenty feet in height. The traveller from the deck of the
steamer, as from some floating castle top, overlooks the whole country
for miles and miles around. Tom, therefore, had spread out full before
him, in plantation after plantation, a map of the life to which he was
approaching.
 
He saw the distant slaves at their toil he saw afar their villages of
huts gleaming out in long rows on many a plantation, distant from the
stately mansions and pleasuregrounds of the masterand as the moving
picture passed on, his poor, foolish heart would be turning backward to
the Kentucky farm, with its old shadowy beeches,to the masters house,
with its wide, cool halls, and, near by, the little cabin overgrown with
the multiflora and bignonia. There he seemed to see familiar faces of
comrades who had grown up with him from infancy he saw his busy wife,
bustling in her preparations for his evening meals he heard the merry
laugh of his boys at their play, and the chirrup of the baby at his
knee and then, with a start, all faded, and he saw again the canebrakes
and cypresses and gliding plantations, and heard again the creaking and
groaning of the machinery, all telling him too plainly that all that
phase of life had gone by forever.
 
In such a case, you write to your wife, and send messages to your
children but Tom could not write,the mail for him had no existence,
and the gulf of separation was unbridged by even a friendly word or
signal.
 
Is it strange, then, that some tears fall on the pages of his Bible, as
he lays it on the cottonbale, and, with patient finger, threading his
slow way from word to word, traces out its promises? Having learned late
in life, Tom was but a slow reader, and passed on laboriously from verse
to verse. Fortunate for him was it that the book he was intent on was
one which slow reading cannot injure,nay, one whose words, like ingots
of gold, seem often to need to be weighed separately, that the mind may
take in their priceless value. Let us follow him a moment, as, pointing
to each word, and pronouncing each half aloud, he reads,
 
"Letnotyourheartbetroubled. Inmy
Fathershousearemanymansions.
Igotoprepareaplaceforyou."
 
Cicero, when he buried his darling and only daughter, had a heart as
full of honest grief as poor Toms,perhaps no fuller, for both were
only menbut Cicero could pause over no such sublime words of hope,
and look to no such future reunion and if he _had_ seen them, ten to
one he would not have believed,he must fill his head first with a
thousand questions of authenticity of manuscript, and correctness of
translation. But, to poor Tom, there it lay, just what he needed, so
evidently true and divine that the possibility of a question never
entered his simple head. It must be true for, if not true, how could he
live?
 
As for Toms Bible, though it had no annotations and helps in margin
from learned commentators, still it had been embellished with certain
waymarks and guideboards of Toms own invention, and which helped him
more than the most learned expositions could have done. It had been
his custom to get the Bible read to him by his masters children,
in particular by young Master George and, as they read, he would
designate, by bold, strong marks and dashes, with pen and ink, the
passages which more particularly gratified his ear or affected his
heart. His Bible was thus marked through, from one end to the other,
with a variety of styles and designations so he could in a moment seize
upon his favorite passages, without the labor of spelling out what
lay between themand while it lay there before him, every passage
breathing of some old home scene, and recalling some past enjoyment,
his Bible seemed to him all of this life that remained, as well as the
promise of a future one.
 
Among the passengers on the boat was a young gentleman of fortune and
family, resident in New Orleans, who bore the name of St. Clare. He had
with him a daughter between five and six years of age, together with a
lady who seemed to claim relationship to both, and to have the little
one especially under her charge.
 
Tom had often caught glimpses of this little girl,for she was one of
those busy, tripping creatures, that can be no more contained in one
place than a sunbeam or a summer breeze,nor was she one that, once
seen, could be easily forgotten.
 
Her form was the perfection of childish beauty, without its usual
chubbiness and squareness of outline. There was about it an undulating
and aerial grace, such as one might dream of for some mythic and
allegorical being. Her face was remarkable less for its perfect beauty
of feature than for a singular and dreamy earnestness of expression,
which made the ideal start when they looked at her, and by which the
dullest and most literal were impressed, without exactly knowing why.
The shape of her head and the turn of her neck and bust was peculiarly
noble, and the long goldenbrown hair that floated like a cloud around
it, the deep spiritual gravity of her violet blue eyes, shaded by heavy
fringes of golden brown,all marked her out from other children, and
made every one turn and look after her, as she glided hither and thither
on the boat. Nevertheless, the little one was not what you would have
called either a grave child or a sad one. On the contrary, an airy and
innocent playfulness seemed to flicker like the shadow of summer leaves
over her childish face, and around her buoyant figure. She was always
in motion, always with a half smile on her rosy mouth, flying hither and
thither, with an undulating and cloudlike tread, singing to herself
as she moved as in a happy dream. Her father and female guardian were
incessantly busy in pursuit of her,but, when caught, she melted from
them again like a summer cloud and as no word of chiding or reproof
ever fell on her ear for whatever she chose to do, she pursued her own
way all over the boat. Always dressed in white, she seemed to move like
a shadow through all sorts of places, without contracting spot or stain
and there was not a corner or nook, above or below, where those fairy
footsteps had not glided, and that visionary golden head, with its deep
blue eyes, fleeted along.
 
The fireman, as he looked up from his sweaty toil, sometimes found those
eyes looking wonderingly into the raging depths of the furnace, and
fearfully and pityingly at him, as if she thought him in some dreadful
danger. Anon the steersman at the wheel paused and smiled, as the
picturelike head gleamed through the window of the round house, and
in a moment was gone again. A thousand times a day rough voices blessed
her, and smiles of unwonted softness stole over hard faces, as she
passed and when she tripped fearlessly over dangerous places, rough,
sooty hands were stretched involuntarily out to save her, and smooth her
path.
 
Tom, who had the soft, impressible nature of his kindly race, ever
yearning toward the simple and childlike, watched the little creature
with daily increasing interest. To him she seemed something almost
divine and whenever her golden head and deep blue eyes peered out upon
him from behind some dusky cottonbale, or looked down upon him over
some ridge of packages, he half believed that he saw one of the angels
stepped out of his New Testament.
 
Often and often she walked mournfully round the place where Haleys gang
of men and women sat in their chains. She would glide in among them,
and look at them with an air of perplexed and sorrowful earnestness and
sometimes she would lift their chains with her slender hands, and then
sigh wofully, as she glided away. Several times she appeared suddenly
among them, with her hands full of candy, nuts, and oranges, which she
would distribute joyfully to them, and then be gone again.
 
Tom watched the little lady a great deal, before he ventured on any
overtures towards acquaintanceship. He knew an abundance of simple acts
to propitiate and invite the approaches of the little people, and he
resolved to play his part right skilfully. He could cut cunning
little baskets out of cherrystones, could make grotesque faces on
hickorynuts, or oddjumping figures out of elderpith, and he was a
very Pan in the manufacture of whistles of all sizes and sorts. His
pockets were full of miscellaneous articles of attraction, which he
had hoarded in days of old for his masters children, and which he
now produced, with commendable prudence and economy, one by one, as
overtures for acquaintance and friendship.
 
The little one was shy, for all her busy interest in everything going
on, and it was not easy to tame her. For a while, she would perch like
a canarybird on some box or package near Tom, while busy in the little
arts aforenamed, and take from him, with a kind of grave bashfulness,
the little articles he offered. But at last they got on quite
confidential terms.
 
"Whats little missys name?" said Tom, at last, when he thought matters
were ripe to push such an inquiry.
 
"Evangeline St. Clare," said the little one, "though papa and everybody
else call me Eva. Now, whats your name?"
 
"My names Tom the little chilen used to call me Uncle Tom, way back
thar in Kentuck."
 
"Then I mean to call you Uncle Tom, because, you see, I like you," said
Eva. "So, Uncle Tom, where are you going?"
 
"I dont know, Miss Eva."
 
"Dont know?" said Eva.
 
"No, I am going to be sold to somebody. I dont know who."
 
"My papa can buy you," said Eva, quickly "and if he buys you, you will
have good times. I mean to ask him, this very day."
 
"Thank you, my little lady," said Tom.
 
The boat here stopped at a small landing to take in wood, and Eva,
hearing her fathers voice, bounded nimbly away. Tom rose up, and went
forward to offer his service in wooding, and soon was busy among the
hands.
 
Eva and her father were standing together by the railings to see the
boat start from the landingplace, the wheel had made two or three
revolutions in the water, when, by some sudden movement, the little one
suddenly lost her balance and fell sheer over the side of the boat into
the water. Her father, scarce knowing what he did, was plunging in after
her, but was held back by some behind him, who saw that more efficient
aid had followed his child.
 
Tom was standing just under her on the lower deck, as she fell. He
saw her strike the water, and sink, and was after her in a moment.
A broadchested, strongarmed fellow, it was nothing for him to keep
afloat in the water, till, in a moment or two the child rose to the
surface, and he caught her in his arms, and, swimming with her to the
boatside, handed her up, all dripping, to the grasp of hundreds of
hands, which, as if they had all belonged to one man, were stretched
eagerly out to receive her. A few moments more, and her father bore
her, dripping and senseless, to the ladies cabin, where, as is usual
in cases of the kind, there ensued a very wellmeaning and kindhearted
strife among the female occupants generally, as to who should do the
most things to make a disturbance, and to hinder her recovery in every
way possible.
 
 
It was a sultry, close day, the next day, as the steamer drew near to
New Orleans. A general bustle of expectation and preparation was spread
through the boat in the cabin, one and another were gathering their
things together, and arranging them, preparatory to going ashore. The
steward and chambermaid, and all, were busily engaged in cleaning,
furbishing, and arranging the splendid boat, preparatory to a grand
entree.
 
On the lower deck sat our friend Tom, with his arms folded, and
anxiously, from time to time, turning his eyes towards a group on the
other side of the boat.
 
There stood the fair Evangeline, a little paler than the day before, but
otherwise exhibiting no traces of the accident which had befallen her.
A graceful, elegantlyformed young man stood by her, carelessly leaning
one elbow on a bale of cotton while a large pocketbook lay open before
him. It was quite evident, at a glance, that the gentleman was Evas
father. There was the same noble cast of head, the same large blue eyes,
the same goldenbrown hair yet the expression was wholly different. In
the large, clear blue eyes, though in form and color exactly similar,
there was wanting that misty, dreamy depth of expression all was clear,
bold, and bright, but with a light wholly of this world the beautifully
cut mouth had a proud and somewhat sarcastic expression, while an air
of freeandeasy superiority sat not ungracefully in every turn and
movement of his fine form. He was listening, with a goodhumored,
negligent air, half comic, half contemptuous, to Haley, who was very
volubly expatiating on the quality of the article for which they were
bargaining.
 
"All the moral and Christian virtues bound in black Morocco, complete!"
he said, when Haley had finished. "Well, now, my good fellow, whats
the damage, as they say in Kentucky in short, whats to be paid out for
this business? How much are you going to cheat me, now? Out with it!"
 
"Wal," said Haley, "if I should say thirteen hundred dollars for that ar
fellow, I shouldnt but just save myself I shouldnt, now, rely."
 
"Poor fellow!" said the young man, fixing his keen, mocking blue eye on
him "but I suppose youd let me have him for that, out of a particular
regard for me."
 
"Well, the young lady here seems to be sot on him, and natlly enough."
 
"O! certainly, theres a call on your benevolence, my friend. Now, as a
matter of Christian charity, how cheap could you afford to let him go,
to oblige a young lady thats particular sot on him?"
 
"Wal, now, just think on t," said the trader "just look at them
limbs,broadchested, strong as a horse. Look at his head them high
forrads allays shows calculatin niggers, thatll do any kind o thing.
Ive, marked that ar. Now, a nigger of that ar heft and build is worth
considerable, just as you may say, for his body, supposin hes stupid
but come to put in his calculatin faculties, and them which I can show
he has oncommon, why, of course, it makes him come higher. Why, that ar
fellow managed his masters whole farm. He has a strornary talent for
business."
 
"Bad, bad, very bad knows altogether too much!" said the young man,
with the same mocking smile playing about his mouth. "Never will do, in
the world. Your smart fellows are always running off, stealing horses,
and raising the devil generally. I think youll have to take off a
couple of hundred for his smartness."
 
"Wal, there might be something in that ar, if it warnt for his
character but I can show recommends from his master and others, to
prove he is one of your real pious,the most humble, prayin, pious
crittur ye ever did see. Why, hes been called a preacher in them parts
he came from."
 
"And I might use him for a family chaplain, possibly," added the young
man, dryly. "Thats quite an idea. Religion is a remarkably scarce
article at our house."
 
"Youre joking, now."
 
"How do you know I am? Didnt you just warrant him for a preacher? Has
he been examined by any synod or council? Come, hand over your papers."
 
If the trader had not been sure, by a certain goodhumored twinkle in
the large eye, that all this banter was sure, in the long run, to turn
out a cash concern, he might have been somewhat out of patience as it
was, he laid down a greasy pocketbook on the cottonbales, and began
anxiously studying over certain papers in it, the young man standing by,
the while, looking down on him with an air of careless, easy drollery.
 
"Papa, do buy him! its no matter what you pay," whispered Eva, softly,
getting up on a package, and putting her arm around her fathers neck.
"You have money enough, I know. I want him."
 
"What for, pussy? Are you going to use him for a rattlebox, or a
rockinghorse, or what?
 
"I want to make him happy."
 
"An original reason, certainly."
 
Here the trader handed up a certificate, signed by Mr. Shelby, which
the young man took with the tips of his long fingers, and glanced over
carelessly.
 
"A gentlemanly hand," he said, "and well spelt, too. Well, now, but
Im not sure, after all, about this religion," said he, the old wicked
expression returning to his eye "the country is almost ruined with
pious white people such pious politicians as we have just before
elections,such pious goings on in all departments of church and state,
that a fellow does not know wholl cheat him next. I dont know, either,
about religions being up in the market, just now. I have not looked in
the papers lately, to see how it sells. How many hundred dollars, now,
do you put on for this religion?"
 
"You like to be jokin, now," said the trader "but, then, theres
_sense_ under all that ar. I know theres differences in religion. Some
kinds is misrable theres your meetin pious theres your singin,
roarin pious them ar ant no account, in black or whitebut these
rayly is and Ive seen it in niggers as often as any, your rail softly,
quiet, stiddy, honest, pious, that the hull world couldnt tempt em
to do nothing that they thinks is wrong and ye see in this letter what
Toms old master says about him."
 
"Now," said the young man, stooping gravely over his book of bills, "if
you can assure me that I really can buy _this_ kind of pious, and that
it will be set down to my account in the book up above, as something
belonging to me, I wouldnt care if I did go a little extra for it. How
dye say?"
 
"Wal, raily, I cant do that," said the trader. "Im a thinkin that
every manll have to hang on his own hook, in them ar quarters."
 
"Rather hard on a fellow that pays extra on religion, and cant trade
with it in the state where he wants it most, ant it, now?" said
the young man, who had been making out a roll of bills while he was
speaking. "There, count your money, old boy!" he added, as he handed the
roll to the trader.
 
"All right," said Haley, his face beaming with delight and pulling out
an old inkhorn, he proceeded to fill out a bill of sale, which, in a few
moments, he handed to the young man.
 
"I wonder, now, if I was divided up and inventoried," said the latter
as he ran over the paper, "how much I might bring. Say so much for the
shape of my head, so much for a high forehead, so much for arms, and
hands, and legs, and then so much for education, learning, talent,
honesty, religion! Bless me! there would be small charge on that last,
Im thinking. But come, Eva," he said and taking the hand of his
daughter, he stepped across the boat, and carelessly putting the tip of
his finger under Toms chin, said, goodhumoredly, "Lookup, Tom, and
see how you like your new master."
 
Tom looked up. It was not in nature to look into that gay, young,
handsome face, without a feeling of pleasure and Tom felt the tears
start in his eyes as he said, heartily, "God bless you, Masr!"
 
"Well, I hope he will. Whats your name? Tom? Quite as likely to do it
for your asking as mine, from all accounts. Can you drive horses, Tom?"
 
"Ive been allays used to horses," said Tom. "Masr Shelby raised heaps
of em."
 
"Well, I think I shall put you in coachy, on condition that you wont be
drunk more than once a week, unless in cases of emergency, Tom."
 
Tom looked surprised, and rather hurt, and said, "I never drink, Masr."
 
"Ive heard that story before, Tom but then well see. It will be a
special accommodation to all concerned, if you dont. Never mind, my
boy," he added, goodhumoredly, seeing Tom still looked grave "I dont
doubt you mean to do well."
 
"I sartin do, Masr," said Tom.
 
"And you shall have good times," said Eva. "Papa is very good to
everybody, only he always will laugh at them."
 
"Papa is much obliged to you for his recommendation," said St. Clare,
laughing, as he turned on his heel and walked away.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XV
 
Of Toms New Master, and Various Other Matters
 
 
Since the thread of our humble heros life has now become interwoven
with that of higher ones, it is necessary to give some brief
introduction to them.
 
Augustine St. Clare was the son of a wealthy planter of Louisiana.
The family had its origin in Canada. Of two brothers, very similar in
temperament and character, one had settled on a flourishing farm in
Vermont, and the other became an opulent planter in Louisiana. The
mother of Augustine was a Huguenot French lady, whose family had
emigrated to Louisiana during the days of its early settlement.
Augustine and another brother were the only children of their parents.
Having inherited from his mother an exceeding delicacy of constitution,
he was, at the instance of physicians, during many years of his boyhood,
sent to the care of his uncle in Vermont, in order that his constitution
might, be strengthened by the cold of a more bracing climate.
 
In childhood, he was remarkable for an extreme and marked sensitiveness
of character, more akin to the softness of woman than the ordinary
hardness of his own sex. Time, however, overgrew this softness with the
rough bark of manhood, and but few knew how living and fresh it still
lay at the core. His talents were of the very first order, although his
mind showed a preference always for the ideal and the aesthetic, and
there was about him that repugnance to the actual business of life which
is the common result of this balance of the faculties. Soon after the
completion of his college course, his whole nature was kindled into
one intense and passionate effervescence of romantic passion. His
hour came,the hour that comes only once his star rose in the
horizon,that star that rises so often in vain, to be remembered
only as a thing of dreams and it rose for him in vain. To drop the
figure,he saw and won the love of a highminded and beautiful woman,
in one of the northern states, and they were affianced. He returned
south to make arrangements for their marriage, when, most unexpectedly,
his letters were returned to him by mail, with a short note from her
guardian, stating to him that ere this reached him the lady would be the
wife of another. Stung to madness, he vainly hoped, as many another has
done, to fling the whole thing from his heart by one desperate effort.
Too proud to supplicate or seek explanation, he threw himself at once
into a whirl of fashionable society, and in a fortnight from the time
of the fatal letter was the accepted lover of the reigning belle of the
season and as soon as arrangements could be made, he became the husband
of a fine figure, a pair of bright dark eyes, and a hundred thousand
dollars and, of course, everybody thought him a happy fellow.
 
The married couple were enjoying their honeymoon, and entertaining
a brilliant circle of friends in their splendid villa, near Lake
Pontchartrain, when, one day, a letter was brought to him in _that_
wellremembered writing. It was handed to him while he was in full tide
of gay and successful conversation, in a whole roomfull of company.
He turned deadly pale when he saw the writing, but still preserved his
composure, and finished the playful warfare of badinage which he was at
the moment carrying on with a lady opposite and, a short time after,
was missed from the circle. In his room, alone, he opened and read the
letter, now worse than idle and useless to be read. It was from her,
giving a long account of a persecution to which she had been exposed by
her guardians family, to lead her to unite herself with their son and
she related how, for a long time, his letters had ceased to arrive how
she had written time and again, till she became weary and doubtful how
her health had failed under her anxieties, and how, at last, she had
discovered the whole fraud which had been practised on them both. The
letter ended with expressions of hope and thankfulness, and professions
of undying affection, which were more bitter than death to the unhappy
young man. He wrote to her immediately
 
"I have received yours,but too late. I believed all I heard. I was
desperate. _I am married_, and all is over. Only forget,it is all that
remains for either of us."
 
And thus ended the whole romance and ideal of life for Augustine St.
Clare. But the _real_ remained,the _real_, like the flat, bare, oozy
tidemud, when the blue sparkling wave, with all its company of gliding
boats and whitewinged ships, its music of oars and chiming waters, has
gone down, and there it lies, flat, slimy, bare,exceedingly real.
 
Of course, in a novel, peoples hearts break, and they die, and that is
the end of it and in a story this is very convenient. But in real life
we do not die when all that makes life bright dies to us. There is a
most busy and important round of eating, drinking, dressing, walking,
visiting, buying, selling, talking, reading, and all that makes up
what is commonly called _living_, yet to be gone through and this yet
remained to Augustine. Had his wife been a whole woman, she might yet
have done somethingas woman canto mend the broken threads of life,
and weave again into a tissue of brightness. But Marie St. Clare could
not even see that they had been broken. As before stated, she consisted
of a fine figure, a pair of splendid eyes, and a hundred thousand
dollars and none of these items were precisely the ones to minister to
a mind diseased.
 
When Augustine, pale as death, was found lying on the sofa, and pleaded
sudden sickheadache as the cause of his distress, she recommended to
him to smell of hartshorn and when the paleness and headache came on
week after week, she only said that she never thought Mr. St. Clare was
sickly but it seems he was very liable to sickheadaches, and that it
was a very unfortunate thing for her, because he didnt enjoy going into
company with her, and it seemed odd to go so much alone, when they were
just married. Augustine was glad in his heart that he had married so
undiscerning a woman but as the glosses and civilities of the honeymoon
wore away, he discovered that a beautiful young woman, who has lived all
her life to be caressed and waited on, might prove quite a hard
mistress in domestic life. Marie never had possessed much capability of
affection, or much sensibility, and the little that she had, had been
merged into a most intense and unconscious selfishness a selfishness
the more hopeless, from its quiet obtuseness, its utter ignorance of
any claims but her own. From her infancy, she had been surrounded with
servants, who lived only to study her caprices the idea that they had
either feelings or rights had never dawned upon her, even in distant
perspective. Her father, whose only child she had been, had never denied
her anything that lay within the compass of human possibility and when
she entered life, beautiful, accomplished, and an heiress, she had, of
course, all the eligibles and noneligibles of the other sex sighing at
her feet, and she had no doubt that Augustine was a most fortunate man
in having obtained her. It is a great mistake to suppose that a woman
with no heart will be an easy creditor in the exchange of affection.
There is not on earth a more merciless exactor of love from others than
a thoroughly selfish woman and the more unlovely she grows, the more
jealously and scrupulously she exacts love, to the uttermost farthing.
When, therefore, St. Clare began to drop off those gallantries and small
attentions which flowed at first through the habitude of courtship, he
found his sultana no way ready to resign her slave there were abundance
of tears, poutings, and small tempests, there were discontents, pinings,
upbraidings. St. Clare was goodnatured and selfindulgent, and sought
to buy off with presents and flatteries and when Marie became mother to
a beautiful daughter, he really felt awakened, for a time, to something
like tenderness.
 
St. Clares mother had been a woman of uncommon elevation and purity of
character, and he gave to his child his mothers name, fondly fancying
that she would prove a reproduction of her image. The thing had been
remarked with petulant jealousy by his wife, and she regarded her
husbands absorbing devotion to the child with suspicion and dislike
all that was given to her seemed so much taken from herself. From the
time of the birth of this child, her health gradually sunk. A life of
constant inaction, bodily and mental,the friction of ceaseless ennui
and discontent, united to the ordinary weakness which attended the
period of maternity,in course of a few years changed the blooming
young belle into a yellow faded, sickly woman, whose time was divided
among a variety of fanciful diseases, and who considered herself, in
every sense, the most illused and suffering person in existence.
 
There was no end of her various complaints but her principal forte
appeared to lie in sickheadache, which sometimes would confine her to
her room three days out of six. As, of course, all family arrangements
fell into the hands of servants, St. Clare found his menage anything but
comfortable. His only daughter was exceedingly delicate, and he feared
that, with no one to look after her and attend to her, her health and
life might yet fall a sacrifice to her mothers inefficiency. He had
taken her with him on a tour to Vermont, and had persuaded his cousin,
Miss Ophelia St. Clare, to return with him to his southern residence
and they are now returning on this boat, where we have introduced them
to our readers.
 
And now, while the distant domes and spires of New Orleans rise to our
view, there is yet time for an introduction to Miss Ophelia.
 
Whoever has travelled in the New England States will remember, in some
cool village, the large farmhouse, with its cleanswept grassy yard,
shaded by the dense and massive foliage of the sugar maple and remember
the air of order and stillness, of perpetuity and unchanging repose,
that seemed to breathe over the whole place. Nothing lost, or out of
order not a picket loose in the fence, not a particle of litter in
the turfy yard, with its clumps of lilac bushes growing up under the
windows. Within, he will remember wide, clean rooms, where nothing ever
seems to be doing or going to be done, where everything is once and
forever rigidly in place, and where all household arrangements move with
the punctual exactness of the old clock in the corner. In the family
"keepingroom," as it is termed, he will remember the staid, respectable
old bookcase, with its glass doors, where Rollins History, Miltons
Paradise Lost, Bunyans Pilgrims Progress, and Scotts Family Bible,
stand side by side in decorous order, with multitudes of other books,
equally solemn and respectable. There are no servants in the house, but
the lady in the snowy cap, with the spectacles, who sits sewing every
afternoon among her daughters, as if nothing ever had been done, or were
to be done,she and her girls, in some longforgotten fore part of the
day, "_did up the work_," and for the rest of the time, probably, at all
hours when you would see them, it is "_done up_." The old kitchen floor
never seems stained or spotted the tables, the chairs, and the various
cooking utensils, never seem deranged or disordered though three and
sometimes four meals a day are got there, though the family washing and
ironing is there performed, and though pounds of butter and cheese are
in some silent and mysterious manner there brought into existence.

On such a farm, in such a house and family, Miss Ophelia had spent a
quiet existence of some fortyfive years, when her cousin invited her to
visit his southern mansion. The eldest of a large family, she was still
considered by her father and mother as one of "the children," and the
proposal that she should go to _Orleans_ was a most momentous one to the
family circle. The old grayheaded father took down Morses Atlas out
of the bookcase, and looked out the exact latitude and longitude and
read Flints Travels in the South and West, to make up his own mind as
to the nature of the country.

The good mother inquired, anxiously, "if Orleans wasnt an awful wicked
place," saying, "that it seemed to her most equal to going to the
Sandwich Islands, or anywhere among the heathen."
 
It was known at the ministers and at the doctors, and at Miss
Peabodys milliner shop, that Ophelia St. Clare was "talking about"
going away down to Orleans with her cousin and of course the whole
village could do no less than help this very important process of
_talking about_ the matter. The minister, who inclined strongly to
abolitionist views, was quite doubtful whether such a step might not
tend somewhat to encourage the southerners in holding on to their
slaves while the doctor, who was a stanch colonizationist, inclined to
the opinion that Miss Ophelia ought to go, to show the Orleans people
that we dont think hardly of them, after all. He was of opinion, in
fact, that southern people needed encouraging. When however, the fact
that she had resolved to go was fully before the public mind, she was
solemnly invited out to tea by all her friends and neighbors for the
space of a fortnight, and her prospects and plans duly canvassed and
inquired into. Miss Moseley, who came into the house to help to do
the dressmaking, acquired daily accessions of importance from the
developments with regard to Miss Ophelias wardrobe which she had been
enabled to make. It was credibly ascertained that Squire Sinclare, as
his name was commonly contracted in the neighborhood, had counted out
fifty dollars, and given them to Miss Ophelia, and told her to buy any
clothes she thought best and that two new silk dresses, and a bonnet,
had been sent for from Boston. As to the propriety of this extraordinary
outlay, the public mind was divided,some affirming that it was well
enough, all things considered, for once in ones life, and others
stoutly affirming that the money had better have been sent to the
missionaries but all parties agreed that there had been no such parasol
seen in those parts as had been sent on from New York, and that she had
one silk dress that might fairly be trusted to stand alone, whatever
might be said of its mistress. There were credible rumors, also, of a
hemstitched pockethandkerchief and report even went so far as to
state that Miss Ophelia had one pockethandkerchief with lace all around
it,it was even added that it was worked in the corners but this
latter point was never satisfactorily ascertained, and remains, in fact,
unsettled to this day.
 
Miss Ophelia, as you now behold her, stands before you, in a very
shining brown linen travellingdress, tall, squareformed, and
angular. Her face was thin, and rather sharp in its outlines the lips
compressed, like those of a person who is in the habit of making up
her mind definitely on all subjects while the keen, dark eyes had a
peculiarly searching, advised movement, and travelled over everything,
as if they were looking for something to take care of.
 
All her movements were sharp, decided, and energetic and, though she
was never much of a talker, her words were remarkably direct, and to the
purpose, when she did speak.
 
In her habits, she was a living impersonation of order, method, and
exactness. In punctuality, she was as inevitable as a clock, and as
inexorable as a railroad engine and she held in most decided contempt
and abomination anything of a contrary character.
 
The great sin of sins, in her eyes,the sum of all evils,was
expressed by one very common and important word in her
vocabulary"shiftlessness." Her finale and ultimatum of contempt
consisted in a very emphatic pronunciation of the word "shiftless" and
by this she characterized all modes of procedure which had not a
direct and inevitable relation to accomplishment of some purpose then
definitely had in mind. People who did nothing, or who did not know
exactly what they were going to do, or who did not take the most direct
way to accomplish what they set their hands to, were objects of her
entire contempt,a contempt shown less frequently by anything she said,
than by a kind of stony grimness, as if she scorned to say anything
about the matter.
 
As to mental cultivation,she had a clear, strong, active mind, was
well and thoroughly read in history and the older English classics,
and thought with great strength within certain narrow limits. Her
theological tenets were all made up, labelled in most positive and
distinct forms, and put by, like the bundles in her patch trunk there
were just so many of them, and there were never to be any more.
So, also, were her ideas with regard to most matters of practical
life,such as housekeeping in all its branches, and the various
political relations of her native village. And, underlying all, deeper
than anything else, higher and broader, lay the strongest principle
of her beingconscientiousness. Nowhere is conscience so dominant and
allabsorbing as with New England women. It is the granite formation,
which lies deepest, and rises out, even to the tops of the highest
mountains.
 
Miss Ophelia was the absolute bondslave of the "_ought_." Once make her
certain that the "path of duty," as she commonly phrased it, lay in
any given direction, and fire and water could not keep her from it. She
would walk straight down into a well, or up to a loaded cannons mouth,
if she were only quite sure that there the path lay. Her standard
of right was so high, so allembracing, so minute, and making so few
concessions to human frailty, that, though she strove with heroic ardor
to reach it, she never actually did so, and of course was burdened with
a constant and often harassing sense of deficiencythis gave a severe
and somewhat gloomy cast to her religious character.
 
But, how in the world can Miss Ophelia get along with Augustine
St. Clare,gay, easy, unpunctual, unpractical, sceptical,in
short,walking with impudent and nonchalant freedom over every one of
her most cherished habits and opinions?
 
To tell the truth, then, Miss Ophelia loved him. When a boy, it had been
hers to teach him his catechism, mend his clothes, comb his hair, and
bring him up generally in the way he should go and her heart having
a warm side to it, Augustine had, as he usually did with most people,
monopolized a large share of it for himself, and therefore it was that
he succeeded very easily in persuading her that the "path of duty" lay
in the direction of New Orleans, and that she must go with him to take
care of Eva, and keep everything from going to wreck and ruin during the
frequent illnesses of his wife. The idea of a house without anybody
to take care of it went to her heart then she loved the lovely little
girl, as few could help doing and though she regarded Augustine as very
much of a heathen, yet she loved him, laughed at his jokes, and forbore
with his failings, to an extent which those who knew him thought
perfectly incredible. But what more or other is to be known of Miss
Ophelia our reader must discover by a personal acquaintance.
 
There she is, sitting now in her stateroom, surrounded by a mixed
multitude of little and big carpetbags, boxes, baskets, each containing
some separate responsibility which she is tying, binding up, packing, or
fastening, with a face of great earnestness.
 
"Now, Eva, have you kept count of your things? Of course you
havent,children never do theres the spotted carpetbag and the
little blue bandbox with your best bonnet,thats two then the India
rubber satchel is three and my tape and needle box is four and my
bandbox, five and my collarbox and that little hair trunk, seven.
What have you done with your sunshade? Give it to me, and let me put a
paper round it, and tie it to my umbrella with my shadethere, now."
 
"Why, aunty, we are only going up homewhat is the use?"
 
"To keep it nice, child people must take care of their things, if they
ever mean to have anything and now, Eva, is your thimble put up?"
 
"Really, aunty, I dont know."
 
"Well, never mind Ill look your box over,thimble, wax, two spools,
scissors, knife, tapeneedle all right,put it in here. What did you
ever do, child, when you were coming on with only your papa. I should
have thought youd a lost everything you had."
 
"Well, aunty, I did lose a great many and then, when we stopped
anywhere, papa would buy some more of whatever it was."
 
"Mercy on us, child,what a way!"
 
"It was a very easy way, aunty," said Eva.
 
"Its a dreadful shiftless one," said aunty.
 
"Why, aunty, whatll you do now?" said Eva "that trunk is too full to
be shut down."
 
"It _must_ shut down," said aunty, with the air of a general, as she
squeezed the things in, and sprung upon the lidstill a little gap
remained about the mouth of the trunk.
 
"Get up here, Eva!" said Miss Ophelia, courageously "what has been done
can be done again. This trunk has _got to be_ shut and lockedthere are
no two ways about it."
 
And the trunk, intimidated, doubtless, by this resolute statement, gave
in. The hasp snapped sharply in its hole, and Miss Ophelia turned the
key, and pocketed it in triumph.
 
"Now were ready. Wheres your papa? I think it time this baggage was
set out. Do look out, Eva, and see if you see your papa."
 
"O, yes, hes down the other end of the gentlemens cabin, eating an
orange."
 
"He cant know how near we are coming," said aunty "hadnt you better
run and speak to him?"
 
"Papa never is in a hurry about anything," said Eva, "and we havent
come to the landing. Do step on the guards, aunty. Look! theres our
house, up that street!"
 
The boat now began, with heavy groans, like some vast, tired monster,
to prepare to push up among the multiplied steamers at the levee. Eva
joyously pointed out the various spires, domes, and waymarks, by which
she recognized her native city.
 
"Yes, yes, dear very fine," said Miss Ophelia. "But mercy on us! the
boat has stopped! where is your father?"
 
And now ensued the usual turmoil of landingwaiters running twenty ways
at oncemen tugging trunks, carpetbags, boxeswomen anxiously calling
to their children, and everybody crowding in a dense mass to the plank
towards the landing.
 
Miss Ophelia seated herself resolutely on the lately vanquished trunk,
and marshalling all her goods and chattels in fine military order,
seemed resolved to defend them to the last.
 
"Shall I take your trunk, maam?" "Shall I take your baggage?" "Let me
tend to your baggage, Missis?" "Shant I carry out these yer, Missis?"
rained down upon her unheeded. She sat with grim determination, upright
as a darningneedle stuck in a board, holding on her bundle of umbrella
and parasols, and replying with a determination that was enough to
strike dismay even into a hackman, wondering to Eva, in each interval,
"what upon earth her papa could be thinking of he couldnt have fallen
over, now,but something must have happened"and just as she had
begun to work herself into a real distress, he came up, with his usually
careless motion, and giving Eva a quarter of the orange he was eating,
said,
 
"Well, Cousin Vermont, I suppose you are all ready."
 
"Ive been ready, waiting, nearly an hour," said Miss Ophelia "I began
to be really concerned about you.
 
"Thats a clever fellow, now," said he. "Well, the carriage is waiting,
and the crowd are now off, so that one can walk out in a decent and
Christian manner, and not be pushed and shoved. Here," he added to a
driver who stood behind him, "take these things."
 
"Ill go and see to his putting them in," said Miss Ophelia.
 
"O, pshaw, cousin, whats the use?" said St. Clare.
 
"Well, at any rate, Ill carry this, and this, and this," said Miss
Ophelia, singling out three boxes and a small carpetbag.
 
"My dear Miss Vermont, positively you mustnt come the Green Mountains
over us that way. You must adopt at least a piece of a southern
principle, and not walk out under all that load. Theyll take you for a
waitingmaid give them to this fellow hell put them down as if they
were eggs, now."
 
Miss Ophelia looked despairingly as her cousin took all her treasures
from her, and rejoiced to find herself once more in the carriage with
them, in a state of preservation.
 
"Wheres Tom?" said Eva.
 
"O, hes on the outside, Pussy. Im going to take Tom up to mother for
a peaceoffering, to make up for that drunken fellow that upset the
carriage."
 
"O, Tom will make a splendid driver, I know," said Eva "hell never get
drunk."
 
The carriage stopped in front of an ancient mansion, built in that odd
mixture of Spanish and French style, of which there are specimens in
some parts of New Orleans. It was built in the Moorish fashion,a
square building enclosing a courtyard, into which the carriage drove
through an arched gateway. The court, in the inside, had evidently
been arranged to gratify a picturesque and voluptuous ideality. Wide
galleries ran all around the four sides, whose Moorish arches, slender
pillars, and arabesque ornaments, carried the mind back, as in a dream,
to the reign of oriental romance in Spain. In the middle of the court, a
fountain threw high its silvery water, falling in a neverceasing spray
into a marble basin, fringed with a deep border of fragrant violets. The
water in the fountain, pellucid as crystal, was alive with myriads of
gold and silver fishes, twinkling and darting through it like so many
living jewels. Around the fountain ran a walk, paved with a mosaic
of pebbles, laid in various fanciful patterns and this, again, was
surrounded by turf, smooth as green velvet, while a carriagedrive
enclosed the whole. Two large orangetrees, now fragrant with blossoms,
threw a delicious shade and, ranged in a circle round upon the turf,
were marble vases of arabesque sculpture, containing the choicest
flowering plants of the tropics. Huge pomegranate trees, with their
glossy leaves and flamecolored flowers, darkleaved Arabian jessamines,
with their silvery stars, geraniums, luxuriant roses bending beneath
their heavy abundance of flowers, golden jessamines, lemonscented
verbenum, all united their bloom and fragrance, while here and there a
mystic old aloe, with its strange, massive leaves, sat looking like some
old enchanter, sitting in weird grandeur among the more perishable bloom
and fragrance around it.
 
The galleries that surrounded the court were festooned with a curtain
of some kind of Moorish stuff, and could be drawn down at pleasure, to
exclude the beams of the sun. On the whole, the appearance of the place
was luxurious and romantic.
 
As the carriage drove in, Eva seemed like a bird ready to burst from a
cage, with the wild eagerness of her delight.
 
"O, isnt it beautiful, lovely! my own dear, darling home!" she said to
Miss Ophelia. "Isnt it beautiful?"
 
"T is a pretty place," said Miss Ophelia, as she alighted "though it
looks rather old and heathenish to me."
 
Tom got down from the carriage, and looked about with an air of calm,
still enjoyment. The negro, it must be remembered, is an exotic of the
most gorgeous and superb countries of the world, and he has, deep in his
heart, a passion for all that is splendid, rich, and fanciful a passion
which, rudely indulged by an untrained taste, draws on them the ridicule
of the colder and more correct white race.
 
St. Clare, who was in heart a poetical voluptuary, smiled as Miss
Ophelia made her remark on his premises, and, turning to Tom, who was
standing looking round, his beaming black face perfectly radiant with
admiration, he said,
 
"Tom, my boy, this seems to suit you."
 
"Yes, Masr, it looks about the right thing," said Tom.
 
All this passed in a moment, while trunks were being hustled off,
hackman paid, and while a crowd, of all ages and sizes,men, women, and
children,came running through the galleries, both above and below
to see Masr come in. Foremost among them was a highlydressed young
mulatto man, evidently a very _distingue_ personage, attired in the
ultra extreme of the mode, and gracefully waving a scented cambric
handkerchief in his hand.
 
This personage had been exerting himself, with great alacrity, in
driving all the flock of domestics to the other end of the verandah.
 
"Back! all of you. I am ashamed of you," he said, in a tone of
authority. "Would you intrude on Masters domestic relations, in the
first hour of his return?"
 
All looked abashed at this elegant speech, delivered with quite an air,
and stood huddled together at a respectful distance, except two stout
porters, who came up and began conveying away the baggage.
 
Owing to Mr. Adolphs systematic arrangements, when St. Clare turned
round from paying the hackman, there was nobody in view but Mr. Adolph
himself, conspicuous in satin vest, gold guardchain, and white pants,
and bowing with inexpressible grace and suavity.
 
"Ah, Adolph, is it you?" said his master, offering his hand to him
"how are you, boy?" while Adolph poured forth, with great fluency, an
extemporary speech, which he had been preparing, with great care, for a
fortnight before.
 
"Well, well," said St. Clare, passing on, with his usual air of
negligent drollery, "thats very well got up, Adolph. See that the
baggage is well bestowed. Ill come to the people in a minute" and,
so saying, he led Miss Ophelia to a large parlor that opened on the
verandah.
 
While this had been passing, Eva had flown like a bird, through the
porch and parlor, to a little boudoir opening likewise on the verandah.
 
A tall, darkeyed, sallow woman, half rose from a couch on which she was
reclining.
 
"Mamma!" said Eva, in a sort of a rapture, throwing herself on her neck,
and embracing her over and over again.
 
"Thatll do,take care, child,dont, you make my head ache," said the
mother, after she had languidly kissed her.
 
St. Clare came in, embraced his wife in true, orthodox, husbandly
fashion, and then presented to her his cousin. Marie lifted her large
eyes on her cousin with an air of some curiosity, and received her with
languid politeness. A crowd of servants now pressed to the entry
door, and among them a middleaged mulatto woman, of very respectable
appearance, stood foremost, in a tremor of expectation and joy, at the
door.
 
"O, theres Mammy!" said Eva, as she flew across the room and, throwing
herself into her arms, she kissed her repeatedly.
 
This woman did not tell her that she made her head ache, but, on the
contrary, she hugged her, and laughed, and cried, till her sanity was a
thing to be doubted of and when released from her, Eva flew from one
to another, shaking hands and kissing, in a way that Miss Ophelia
afterwards declared fairly turned her stomach.
 
"Well!" said Miss Ophelia, "you southern children can do something that
_I_ couldnt."
 
"What, now, pray?" said St. Clare.
 
"Well, I want to be kind to everybody, and I wouldnt have anything
hurt but as to kissing"
 
"Niggers," said St. Clare, "that youre not up to,hey?"
 
"Yes, thats it. How can she?"
 
St. Clare laughed, as he went into the passage. "Halloa, here, whats
to pay out here? Here, you allMammy, Jimmy, Polly, Sukeyglad to see
Masr?" he said, as he went shaking hands from one to another. "Look out
for the babies!" he added, as he stumbled over a sooty little urchin,
who was crawling upon all fours. "If I step upon anybody, let em
mention it."
 
There was an abundance of laughing and blessing Masr, as St. Clare
distributed small pieces of change among them.
 
"Come, now, take yourselves off, like good boys and girls," he said and
the whole assemblage, dark and light, disappeared through a door into a
large verandah, followed by Eva, who carried a large satchel, which she
had been filling with apples, nuts, candy, ribbons, laces, and toys of
every description, during her whole homeward journey.
 
As St. Clare turned to go back his eye fell upon Tom, who was standing
uneasily, shifting from one foot to the other, while Adolph stood
negligently leaning against the banisters, examining Tom through an
operaglass, with an air that would have done credit to any dandy
living.
 
"Puh! you puppy," said his master, striking down the opera glass "is
that the way you treat your company? Seems to me, Dolph," he added,
laying his finger on the elegant figured satin vest that Adolph was
sporting, "seems to me thats _my_ vest."
 
"O! Master, this vest all stained with wine of course, a gentleman in
Masters standing never wears a vest like this. I understood I was to
take it. It does for a poor niggerfellow, like me."
 
And Adolph tossed his head, and passed his fingers through his scented
hair, with a grace.
 
"So, thats it, is it?" said St. Clare, carelessly. "Well, here, Im
going to show this Tom to his mistress, and then you take him to the
kitchen and mind you dont put on any of your airs to him. Hes worth
two such puppies as you."
 
"Master always will have his joke," said Adolph, laughing. "Im
delighted to see Master in such spirits."
 
"Here, Tom," said St. Clare, beckoning.
 
Tom entered the room. He looked wistfully on the velvet carpets, and the
before unimagined splendors of mirrors, pictures, statues, and curtains,
and, like the Queen of Sheba before Solomon, there was no more spirit in
him. He looked afraid even to set his feet down.
 
"See here, Marie," said St. Clare to his wife, "Ive bought you a
coachman, at last, to order. I tell you, hes a regular hearse for
blackness and sobriety, and will drive you like a funeral, if you want.
Open your eyes, now, and look at him. Now, dont say I never think about
you when Im gone."
 
Marie opened her eyes, and fixed them on Tom, without rising.
 
"I know hell get drunk," she said.
 
"No, hes warranted a pious and sober article."
 
"Well, I hope he may turn out well," said the lady "its more than I
expect, though."
 
"Dolph," said St. Clare, "show Tom down stairs and, mind yourself," he
added "remember what I told you."
 
Adolph tripped gracefully forward, and Tom, with lumbering tread, went
after.
 
"Hes a perfect behemoth!" said Marie.
 
"Come, now, Marie," said St. Clare, seating himself on a stool beside
her sofa, "be gracious, and say something pretty to a fellow."
 
"Youve been gone a fortnight beyond the time," said the lady, pouting.
 
"Well, you know I wrote you the reason."
 
"Such a short, cold letter!" said the lady.
 
"Dear me! the mail was just going, and it had to be that or nothing."
 
"Thats just the way, always," said the lady "always something to make
your journeys long, and letters short."
 
"See here, now," he added, drawing an elegant velvet case out of his
pocket, and opening it, "heres a present I got for you in New York."
 
It was a daguerreotype, clear and soft as an engraving, representing Eva
and her father sitting hand in hand.
 
Marie looked at it with a dissatisfied air.
 
"What made you sit in such an awkward position?" she said.
 
"Well, the position may be a matter of opinion but what do you think of
the likeness?"
 
"If you dont think anything of my opinion in one case, I suppose you
wouldnt in another," said the lady, shutting the daguerreotype.
 
"Hang the woman!" said St. Clare, mentally but aloud he added, "Come,
now, Marie, what do you think of the likeness? Dont be nonsensical,
now."
 
"Its very inconsiderate of you, St. Clare," said the lady, "to insist
on my talking and looking at things. You know Ive been lying all day
with the sickheadache and theres been such a tumult made ever since
you came, Im half dead."
 
"Youre subject to the sickheadache, maam!" said Miss Ophelia,
suddenly rising from the depths of the large armchair, where she had
sat quietly, taking an inventory of the furniture, and calculating its
expense.
 
"Yes, Im a perfect martyr to it," said the lady.
 
"Juniperberry tea is good for sickheadache," said Miss Ophelia "at
least, Auguste, Deacon Abraham Perrys wife, used to say so and she was
a great nurse."
 
"Ill have the first juniperberries that get ripe in our garden by
the lake brought in for that special purpose," said St. Clare, gravely
pulling the bell as he did so "meanwhile, cousin, you must be wanting
to retire to your apartment, and refresh yourself a little, after your
journey. Dolph," he added, "tell Mammy to come here." The decent mulatto
woman whom Eva had caressed so rapturously soon entered she was dressed
neatly, with a high red and yellow turban on her head, the recent gift
of Eva, and which the child had been arranging on her head. "Mammy,"
said St. Clare, "I put this lady under your care she is tired,
and wants rest take her to her chamber, and be sure she is made
comfortable," and Miss Ophelia disappeared in the rear of Mammy.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XVI
 
Toms Mistress and Her Opinions
 
"And now, Marie," said St. Clare, "your golden days are dawning. Here is
our practical, businesslike New England cousin, who will take the
whole budget of cares off your shoulders, and give you time to refresh
yourself, and grow young and handsome. The ceremony of delivering the
keys had better come off forthwith."
 
This remark was made at the breakfasttable, a few mornings after Miss
Ophelia had arrived.
 
"Im sure shes welcome," said Marie, leaning her head languidly on her
hand. "I think shell find one thing, if she does, and that is, that
its we mistresses that are the slaves, down here."
 
"O, certainly, she will discover that, and a world of wholesome truths
besides, no doubt," said St. Clare.
 
"Talk about our keeping slaves, as if we did it for our _convenience_,"
said Marie. "Im sure, if we consulted _that_, we might let them all go
at once."
 
Evangeline fixed her large, serious eyes on her mothers face, with an
earnest and perplexed expression, and said, simply, "What do you keep
them for, mamma?"
 
"I dont know, Im sure, except for a plague they are the plague of my
life. I believe that more of my ill health is caused by them than by any
one thing and ours, I know, are the very worst that ever anybody was
plagued with."
 
"O, come, Marie, youve got the blues, this morning," said St. Clare.
"You know t isnt so. Theres Mammy, the best creature living,what
could you do without her?"
 
"Mammy is the best I ever knew," said Marie "and yet Mammy, now, is
selfishdreadfully selfish its the fault of the whole race."
 
"Selfishness _is_ a dreadful fault," said St. Clare, gravely.
 
"Well, now, theres Mammy," said Marie, "I think its selfish of her to
sleep so sound nights she knows I need little attentions almost every
hour, when my worst turns are on, and yet shes so hard to wake. I
absolutely am worse, this very morning, for the efforts I had to make to
wake her last night."
 
"Hasnt she sat up with you a good many nights, lately, mamma?" said
Eva.
 
"How should you know that?" said Marie, sharply "shes been
complaining, I suppose."
 
"She didnt complain she only told me what bad nights youd had,so
many in succession."
 
"Why dont you let Jane or Rosa take her place, a night or two," said
St. Clare, "and let her rest?"
 
"How can you propose it?" said Marie. "St. Clare, you really are
inconsiderate. So nervous as I am, the least breath disturbs me and a
strange hand about me would drive me absolutely frantic. If Mammy felt
the interest in me she ought to, shed wake easier,of course, she
would. Ive heard of people who had such devoted servants, but it never
was _my_ luck" and Marie sighed.
 
Miss Ophelia had listened to this conversation with an air of shrewd,
observant gravity and she still kept her lips tightly compressed, as
if determined fully to ascertain her longitude and position, before she
committed herself.
 
"Now, Mammy has a _sort_ of goodness," said Marie "shes smooth and
respectful, but shes selfish at heart. Now, she never will be done
fidgeting and worrying about that husband of hers. You see, when I was
married and came to live here, of course, I had to bring her with me,
and her husband my father couldnt spare. He was a blacksmith, and, of
course, very necessary and I thought and said, at the time, that
Mammy and he had better give each other up, as it wasnt likely to
be convenient for them ever to live together again. I wish, now, Id
insisted on it, and married Mammy to somebody else but I was foolish
and indulgent, and didnt want to insist. I told Mammy, at the time,
that she mustnt ever expect to see him more than once or twice in her
life again, for the air of fathers place doesnt agree with my health,
and I cant go there and I advised her to take up with somebody else
but noshe wouldnt. Mammy has a kind of obstinacy about her, in spots,
that everybody dont see as I do."
 
"Has she children?" said Miss Ophelia.
 
"Yes she has two."
 
"I suppose she feels the separation from them?"
 
"Well, of course, I couldnt bring them. They were little dirty
thingsI couldnt have them about and, besides, they took up too
much of her time but I believe that Mammy has always kept up a sort of
sulkiness about this. She wont marry anybody else and I do believe,
now, though she knows how necessary she is to me, and how feeble my
health is, she would go back to her husband tomorrow, if she only could.
I _do_, indeed," said Marie "they are just so selfish, now, the best of
them."
 
"Its distressing to reflect upon," said St. Clare, dryly.
 
Miss Ophelia looked keenly at him, and saw the flush of mortification
and repressed vexation, and the sarcastic curl of the lip, as he spoke.
 
"Now, Mammy has always been a pet with me," said Marie. "I wish some of
your northern servants could look at her closets of dresses,silks and
muslins, and one real linen cambric, she has hanging there. Ive worked
sometimes whole afternoons, trimming her caps, and getting her ready
to go to a party. As to abuse, she dont know what it is. She never was
whipped more than once or twice in her whole life. She has her strong
coffee or her tea every day, with white sugar in it. Its abominable, to
be sure but St. Clare will have high life belowstairs, and they every
one of them live just as they please. The fact is, our servants are
overindulged. I suppose it is partly our fault that they are selfish,
and act like spoiled children but Ive talked to St. Clare till I am
tired."
 
"And I, too," said St. Clare, taking up the morning paper.
 
Eva, the beautiful Eva, had stood listening to her mother, with that
expression of deep and mystic earnestness which was peculiar to her. She
walked softly round to her mothers chair, and put her arms round her
neck.
 
"Well, Eva, what now?" said Marie.
 
"Mamma, couldnt I take care of you one nightjust one? I know I
shouldnt make you nervous, and I shouldnt sleep. I often lie awake
nights, thinking"
 
"O, nonsense, childnonsense!" said Marie "you are such a strange
child!"
 
"But may I, mamma? I think," she said, timidly, "that Mammy isnt well.
She told me her head ached all the time, lately."
 
"O, thats just one of Mammys fidgets! Mammy is just like all the rest
of themmakes such a fuss about every little headache or fingerache
itll never do to encourage itnever! Im principled about this
matter," said she, turning to Miss Ophelia "youll find the necessity
of it. If you encourage servants in giving way to every little
disagreeable feeling, and complaining of every little ailment, youll
have your hands full. I never complain myselfnobody knows what I
endure. I feel it a duty to bear it quietly, and I do."
 
Miss Ophelias round eyes expressed an undisguised amazement at this
peroration, which struck St. Clare as so supremely ludicrous, that he
burst into a loud laugh.
 
"St. Clare always laughs when I make the least allusion to my ill
health," said Marie, with the voice of a suffering martyr. "I only
hope the day wont come when hell remember it!" and Marie put her
handkerchief to her eyes.
 
Of course, there was rather a foolish silence. Finally, St. Clare got
up, looked at his watch, and said he had an engagement down street. Eva
tripped away after him, and Miss Ophelia and Marie remained at the table
alone.
 
"Now, thats just like St. Clare!" said the latter, withdrawing her
handkerchief with somewhat of a spirited flourish when the criminal to
be affected by it was no longer in sight. "He never realizes, never
can, never will, what I suffer, and have, for years. If I was one of the
complaining sort, or ever made any fuss about my ailments, there would
be some reason for it. Men do get tired, naturally, of a complaining
wife. But Ive kept things to myself, and borne, and borne, till St.
Clare has got in the way of thinking I can bear anything."
 
Miss Ophelia did not exactly know what she was expected to answer to
this.
 
While she was thinking what to say, Marie gradually wiped away her
tears, and smoothed her plumage in a general sort of way, as a dove
might be supposed to make toilet after a shower, and began a housewifely
chat with Miss Ophelia, concerning cupboards, closets, linenpresses,
storerooms, and other matters, of which the latter was, by common
understanding, to assume the direction,giving her so many cautious
directions and charges, that a head less systematic and businesslike
than Miss Ophelias would have been utterly dizzied and confounded.
 
"And now," said Marie, "I believe Ive told you everything so that,
when my next sick turn comes on, youll be able to go forward entirely,
without consulting meonly about Eva,she requires watching."
 
"She seems to be a good child, very," said Miss Ophelia "I never saw a
better child."
 
"Evas peculiar," said her mother, "very. There are things about her so
singular she isnt like me, now, a particle" and Marie sighed, as if
this was a truly melancholy consideration.
 
Miss Ophelia in her own heart said, "I hope she isnt," but had prudence
enough to keep it down.
 
"Eva always was disposed to be with servants and I think that well
enough with some children. Now, I always played with fathers little
negroesit never did me any harm. But Eva somehow always seems to put
herself on an equality with every creature that comes near her. Its a
strange thing about the child. I never have been able to break her of
it. St. Clare, I believe, encourages her in it. The fact is, St. Clare
indulges every creature under this roof but his own wife."
 
Again Miss Ophelia sat in blank silence.
 
"Now, theres no way with servants," said Marie, "but to _put them
down_, and keep them down. It was always natural to me, from a child.
Eva is enough to spoil a whole housefull. What she will do when she
comes to keep house herself, Im sure I dont know. I hold to being
_kind_ to servantsI always am but you must make em _know their
place_. Eva never does theres no getting into the childs head the
first beginning of an idea what a servants place is! You heard her
offering to take care of me nights, to let Mammy sleep! Thats just a
specimen of the way the child would be doing all the time, if she was
left to herself."
 
"Why," said Miss Ophelia, bluntly, "I suppose you think your servants
are human creatures, and ought to have some rest when they are tired."
 
"Certainly, of course. Im very particular in letting them have
everything that comes convenient,anything that doesnt put one at
all out of the way, you know. Mammy can make up her sleep, some time
or other theres no difficulty about that. Shes the sleepiest concern
that ever I saw sewing, standing, or sitting, that creature will go to
sleep, and sleep anywhere and everywhere. No danger but Mammy gets sleep
enough. But this treating servants as if they were exotic flowers, or
china vases, is really ridiculous," said Marie, as she plunged languidly
into the depths of a voluminous and pillowy lounge, and drew towards her
an elegant cutglass vinaigrette.
 
"You see," she continued, in a faint and ladylike voice, like the last
dying breath of an Arabian jessamine, or something equally ethereal,
"you see, Cousin Ophelia, I dont often speak of myself. It isnt my
_habit_ t isnt agreeable to me. In fact, I havent strength to do
it. But there are points where St. Clare and I differ. St. Clare never
understood me, never appreciated me. I think it lies at the root of all
my ill health. St. Clare means well, I am bound to believe but men are
constitutionally selfish and inconsiderate to woman. That, at least, is
my impression."
 
Miss Ophelia, who had not a small share of the genuine New England
caution, and a very particular horror of being drawn into family
difficulties, now began to foresee something of this kind impending so,
composing her face into a grim neutrality, and drawing out of her pocket
about a yard and a quarter of stocking, which she kept as a specific
against what Dr. Watts asserts to be a personal habit of Satan when
people have idle hands, she proceeded to knit most energetically,
shutting her lips together in a way that said, as plain as words could,
"You neednt try to make me speak. I dont want anything to do with your
affairs,"in fact, she looked about as sympathizing as a stone lion.
But Marie didnt care for that. She had got somebody to talk to, and she
felt it her duty to talk, and that was enough and reinforcing herself
by smelling again at her vinaigrette, she went on.
 
"You see, I brought my own property and servants into the connection,
when I married St. Clare, and I am legally entitled to manage them my
own way. St. Clare had his fortune and his servants, and Im well
enough content he should manage them his way but St. Clare will be
interfering. He has wild, extravagant notions about things, particularly
about the treatment of servants. He really does act as if he set his
servants before me, and before himself, too for he lets them make him
all sorts of trouble, and never lifts a finger. Now, about some things,
St. Clare is really frightfulhe frightens megoodnatured as he
looks, in general. Now, he has set down his foot that, come what will,
there shall not be a blow struck in this house, except what he or I
strike and he does it in a way that I really dare not cross him. Well,
you may see what that leads to for St. Clare wouldnt raise his hand,
if every one of them walked over him, and Iyou see how cruel it would
be to require me to make the exertion. Now, you know these servants are
nothing but grownup children."
 
"I dont know anything about it, and I thank the Lord that I dont!"
said Miss Ophelia, shortly.
 
"Well, but you will have to know something, and know it to your cost,
if you stay here. You dont know what a provoking, stupid, careless,
unreasonable, childish, ungrateful set of wretches they are."
 
Marie seemed wonderfully supported, always, when she got upon this
topic and she now opened her eyes, and seemed quite to forget her
languor.
 
"You dont know, and you cant, the daily, hourly trials that beset
a housekeeper from them, everywhere and every way. But its no use to
complain to St. Clare. He talks the strangest stuff. He says we have
made them what they are, and ought to bear with them. He says their
faults are all owing to us, and that it would be cruel to make the fault
and punish it too. He says we shouldnt do any better, in their place
just as if one could reason from them to us, you know."
 
"Dont you believe that the Lord made them of one blood with us?" said
Miss Ophelia, shortly.
 
"No, indeed not I! A pretty story, truly! They are a degraded race."
 
"Dont you think theyve got immortal souls?" said Miss Ophelia, with
increasing indignation.
 
"O, well," said Marie, yawning, "that, of coursenobody doubts that.
But as to putting them on any sort of equality with us, you know, as if
we could be compared, why, its impossible! Now, St. Clare really has
talked to me as if keeping Mammy from her husband was like keeping me
from mine. Theres no comparing in this way. Mammy couldnt have the
feelings that I should. Its a different thing altogether,of course,
it is,and yet St. Clare pretends not to see it. And just as if Mammy
could love her little dirty babies as I love Eva! Yet St. Clare once
really and soberly tried to persuade me that it was my duty, with my
weak health, and all I suffer, to let Mammy go back, and take somebody
else in her place. That was a little too much even for _me_ to bear. I
dont often show my feelings, I make it a principle to endure everything
in silence its a wifes hard lot, and I bear it. But I did break out,
that time so that he has never alluded to the subject since. But I know
by his looks, and little things that he says, that he thinks so as much
as ever and its so trying, so provoking!"
 
Miss Ophelia looked very much as if she was afraid she should say
something but she rattled away with her needles in a way that had
volumes of meaning in it, if Marie could only have understood it.
 
"So, you just see," she continued, "what youve got to manage. A
household without any rule where servants have it all their own way, do
what they please, and have what they please, except so far as I, with
my feeble health, have kept up government. I keep my cowhide about, and
sometimes I do lay it on but the exertion is always too much for me. If
St. Clare would only have this thing done as others do"
 
"And hows that?"
 
"Why, send them to the calaboose, or some of the other places to be
flogged. Thats the only way. If I wasnt such a poor, feeble piece, I
believe I should manage with twice the energy that St. Clare does."
 
"And how does St. Clare contrive to manage?" said Miss Ophelia. "You say
he never strikes a blow."
 
"Well, men have a more commanding way, you know it is easier for
them besides, if you ever looked full in his eye, its peculiar,that
eye,and if he speaks decidedly, theres a kind of flash. Im afraid of
it, myself and the servants know they must mind. I couldnt do as much
by a regular storm and scolding as St. Clare can by one turn of his eye,
if once he is in earnest. O, theres no trouble about St. Clare thats
the reason hes no more feeling for me. But youll find, when you come
to manage, that theres no getting along without severity,they are so
bad, so deceitful, so lazy."
 
"The old tune," said St. Clare, sauntering in. "What an awful account
these wicked creatures will have to settle, at last, especially for
being lazy! You see, cousin," said he, as he stretched himself at full
length on a lounge opposite to Marie, "its wholly inexcusable in them,
in the light of the example that Marie and I set them,this laziness."
 
"Come, now, St. Clare, you are too bad!" said Marie.
 
"Am I, now? Why, I thought I was talking good, quite remarkably for me.
I try to enforce your remarks, Marie, always."
 
"You know you meant no such thing, St. Clare," said Marie.
 
"O, I must have been mistaken, then. Thank you, my dear, for setting me
right."
 
"You do really try to be provoking," said Marie.
 
"O, come, Marie, the day is growing warm, and I have just had a long
quarrel with Dolph, which has fatigued me excessively so, pray be
agreeable, now, and let a fellow repose in the light of your smile."
 
"Whats the matter about Dolph?" said Marie. "That fellows impudence
has been growing to a point that is perfectly intolerable to me. I
only wish I had the undisputed management of him a while. Id bring him
down!"
 
"What you say, my dear, is marked with your usual acuteness and good
sense," said St. Clare. "As to Dolph, the case is this that he has so
long been engaged in imitating my graces and perfections, that he has,
at last, really mistaken himself for his master and I have been obliged
to give him a little insight into his mistake."
 
"How?" said Marie.
 
"Why, I was obliged to let him understand explicitly that I preferred to
keep _some_ of my clothes for my own personal wearing also, I put his
magnificence upon an allowance of colognewater, and actually was so
cruel as to restrict him to one dozen of my cambric handkerchiefs. Dolph
was particularly huffy about it, and I had to talk to him like a father,
to bring him round."
 
"O! St. Clare, when will you learn how to treat your servants? Its
abominable, the way you indulge them!" said Marie.
 
"Why, after all, whats the harm of the poor dogs wanting to be like
his master and if I havent brought him up any better than to find his
chief good in cologne and cambric handkerchiefs, why shouldnt I give
them to him?"
 
"And why havent you brought him up better?" said Miss Ophelia, with
blunt determination.
 
"Too much trouble,laziness, cousin, laziness,which ruins more souls
than you can shake a stick at. If it werent for laziness, I should have
been a perfect angel, myself. Im inclined to think that laziness is
what your old Dr. Botherem, up in Vermont, used to call the essence of
moral evil. Its an awful consideration, certainly."
 
"I think you slaveholders have an awful responsibility upon you," said
Miss Ophelia. "I wouldnt have it, for a thousand worlds. You ought to
educate your slaves, and treat them like reasonable creatures,like
immortal creatures, that youve got to stand before the bar of God with.
Thats my mind," said the good lady, breaking suddenly out with a tide
of zeal that had been gaining strength in her mind all the morning.
 
"O! come, come," said St. Clare, getting up quickly "what do you know
about us?" And he sat down to the piano, and rattled a lively piece of
music. St. Clare had a decided genius for music. His touch was brilliant
and firm, and his fingers flew over the keys with a rapid and birdlike
motion, airy, and yet decided. He played piece after piece, like a man
who is trying to play himself into a good humor. After pushing the music
aside, he rose up, and said, gayly, "Well, now, cousin, youve given us
a good talk and done your duty on the whole, I think the better of you
for it. I make no manner of doubt that you threw a very diamond of truth
at me, though you see it hit me so directly in the face that it wasnt
exactly appreciated, at first."
 
"For my part, I dont see any use in such sort of talk," said Marie.
"Im sure, if anybody does more for servants than we do, Id like to
know who and it dont do em a bit good,not a particle,they get
worse and worse. As to talking to them, or anything like that, Im sure
I have talked till I was tired and hoarse, telling them their duty, and
all that and Im sure they can go to church when they like, though they
dont understand a word of the sermon, more than so many pigs,so it
isnt of any great use for them to go, as I see but they do go, and so
they have every chance but, as I said before, they are a degraded race,
and always will be, and there isnt any help for them you cant make
anything of them, if you try. You see, Cousin Ophelia, Ive tried, and
you havent I was born and bred among them, and I know."
 
Miss Ophelia thought she had said enough, and therefore sat silent. St.
Clare whistled a tune.
 
"St. Clare, I wish you wouldnt whistle," said Marie "it makes my head
worse."
 
"I wont," said St. Clare. "Is there anything else you wouldnt wish me
to do?"
 
"I wish you _would_ have some kind of sympathy for my trials you never
have any feeling for me."
 
"My dear accusing angel!" said St. Clare.
 
"Its provoking to be talked to in that way."
 
"Then, how will you be talked to? Ill talk to order,any way youll
mention,only to give satisfaction."
 
A gay laugh from the court rang through the silken curtains of the
verandah. St. Clare stepped out, and lifting up the curtain, laughed
too.
 
"What is it?" said Miss Ophelia, coming to the railing.
 
There sat Tom, on a little mossy seat in the court, every one of his
buttonholes stuck full of cape jessamines, and Eva, gayly laughing, was
hanging a wreath of roses round his neck and then she sat down on his
knee, like a chipsparrow, still laughing.
 
"O, Tom, you look so funny!"
 
Tom had a sober, benevolent smile, and seemed, in his quiet way, to be
enjoying the fun quite as much as his little mistress. He lifted his
eyes, when he saw his master, with a halfdeprecating, apologetic air.
 
"How can you let her?" said Miss Ophelia.
 
"Why not?" said St. Clare.
 
"Why, I dont know, it seems so dreadful!"
 
"You would think no harm in a childs caressing a large dog, even if he
was black but a creature that can think, and reason, and feel, and is
immortal, you shudder at confess it, cousin. I know the feeling among
some of you northerners well enough. Not that there is a particle of
virtue in our not having it but custom with us does what Christianity
ought to do,obliterates the feeling of personal prejudice. I have
often noticed, in my travels north, how much stronger this was with you
than with us. You loathe them as you would a snake or a toad, yet you
are indignant at their wrongs. You would not have them abused but you
dont want to have anything to do with them yourselves. You would send
them to Africa, out of your sight and smell, and then send a missionary
or two to do up all the selfdenial of elevating them compendiously.
Isnt that it?"
 
"Well, cousin," said Miss Ophelia, thoughtfully, "there may be some
truth in this."
 
"What would the poor and lowly do, without children?" said St. Clare,
leaning on the railing, and watching Eva, as she tripped off, leading
Tom with her. "Your little child is your only true democrat. Tom, now
is a hero to Eva his stories are wonders in her eyes, his songs and
Methodist hymns are better than an opera, and the traps and little bits
of trash in his pocket a mine of jewels, and he the most wonderful Tom
that ever wore a black skin. This is one of the roses of Eden that the
Lord has dropped down expressly for the poor and lowly, who get few
enough of any other kind."
 
"Its strange, cousin," said Miss Ophelia, "one might almost think you
were a _professor_, to hear you talk."
 
"A professor?" said St. Clare.
 
"Yes a professor of religion."
 
"Not at all not a professor, as your townfolks have it and, what is
worse, Im afraid, not a _practiser_, either."
 
"What makes you talk so, then?"
 
"Nothing is easier than talking," said St. Clare. "I believe Shakespeare
makes somebody say, I could sooner show twenty what were good to be
done, than be one of the twenty to follow my own showing. Nothing like
division of labor. My forte lies in talking, and yours, cousin, lies in
doing."
 
      _The Merchant of Venice_, Act 1, scene 2, lines 1718.
 
 
In Toms external situation, at this time, there was, as the world
says, nothing to complain of Little Evas fancy for himthe instinctive
gratitude and loveliness of a noble naturehad led her to petition her
father that he might be her especial attendant, whenever she needed the
escort of a servant, in her walks or rides and Tom had general orders
to let everything else go, and attend to Miss Eva whenever she wanted
him,orders which our readers may fancy were far from disagreeable to
him. He was kept well dressed, for St. Clare was fastidiously particular
on this point. His stable services were merely a sinecure, and consisted
simply in a daily care and inspection, and directing an underservant
in his duties for Marie St. Clare declared that she could not have any
smell of the horses about him when he came near her, and that he must
positively not be put to any service that would make him unpleasant to
her, as her nervous system was entirely inadequate to any trial of
that nature one snuff of anything disagreeable being, according to her
account, quite sufficient to close the scene, and put an end to all her
earthly trials at once. Tom, therefore, in his wellbrushed broadcloth
suit, smooth beaver, glossy boots, faultless wristbands and collar, with
his grave, goodnatured black face, looked respectable enough to be a
Bishop of Carthage, as men of his color were, in other ages.
 
Then, too, he was in a beautiful place, a consideration to which his
sensitive race was never indifferent and he did enjoy with a quiet joy
the birds, the flowers, the fountains, the perfume, and light and
beauty of the court, the silken hangings, and pictures, and lustres,
and statuettes, and gilding, that made the parlors within a kind of
Aladdins palace to him.
 
If ever Africa shall show an elevated and cultivated race,and come
it must, some time, her turn to figure in the great drama of human
improvement.life will awake there with a gorgeousness and splendor of
which our cold western tribes faintly have conceived. In that faroff
mystic land of gold, and gems, and spices, and waving palms, and
wondrous flowers, and miraculous fertility, will awake new forms of
art, new styles of splendor and the negro race, no longer despised
and trodden down, will, perhaps, show forth some of the latest and most
magnificent revelations of human life. Certainly they will, in their
gentleness, their lowly docility of heart, their aptitude to repose on a
superior mind and rest on a higher power, their childlike simplicity of
affection, and facility of forgiveness. In all these they will exhibit
the highest form of the peculiarly _Christian life_, and, perhaps, as
God chasteneth whom he loveth, he hath chosen poor Africa in the furnace
of affliction, to make her the highest and noblest in that kingdom which
he will set up, when every other kingdom has been tried, and failed for
the first shall be last, and the last first.
 
Was this what Marie St. Clare was thinking of, as she stood, gorgeously
dressed, on the verandah, on Sunday morning, clasping a diamond bracelet
on her slender wrist? Most likely it was. Or, if it wasnt that, it was
something else for Marie patronized good things, and she was going now,
in full force,diamonds, silk, and lace, and jewels, and all,to a
fashionable church, to be very religious. Marie always made a point to
be very pious on Sundays. There she stood, so slender, so elegant, so
airy and undulating in all her motions, her lace scarf enveloping her
like a mist. She looked a graceful creature, and she felt very good and
very elegant indeed. Miss Ophelia stood at her side, a perfect contrast.
It was not that she had not as handsome a silk dress and shawl, and
as fine a pockethandkerchief but stiffness and squareness, and
boltuprightness, enveloped her with as indefinite yet appreciable
a presence as did grace her elegant neighbor not the grace of God,
however,that is quite another thing!
 
"Wheres Eva?" said Marie.
 
"The child stopped on the stairs, to say something to Mammy."
 
And what was Eva saying to Mammy on the stairs? Listen, reader, and you
will hear, though Marie does not.
 
"Dear Mammy, I know your head is aching dreadfully."
 
"Lord bless you, Miss Eva! my head allers aches lately. You dont need
to worry."
 
"Well, Im glad youre going out and here,"and the little girl threw
her arms around her,"Mammy, you shall take my vinaigrette."
 
"What! your beautiful gold thing, thar, with them diamonds! Lor, Miss,
t wouldnt be proper, no ways."
 
"Why not? You need it, and I dont. Mamma always uses it for headache,
and itll make you feel better. No, you shall take it, to please me,
now."
 
"Do hear the darlin talk!" said Mammy, as Eva thrust it into her bosom,
and kissing her, ran down stairs to her mother.
 
"What were you stopping for?"
 
"I was just stopping to give Mammy my vinaigrette, to take to church
with her."
 
"Eva" said Marie, stamping impatiently,"your gold vinaigrette to
_Mammy!_ When will you learn whats _proper_? Go right and take it back
this moment!"
 
Eva looked downcast and aggrieved, and turned slowly.
 
"I say, Marie, let the child alone she shall do as she pleases," said
St. Clare.
 
"St. Clare, how will she ever get along in the world?" said Marie.
 
"The Lord knows," said St. Clare, "but shell get along in heaven better
than you or I."
 
"O, papa, dont," said Eva, softly touching his elbow "it troubles
mother."
 
"Well, cousin, are you ready to go to meeting?" said Miss Ophelia,
turning square about on St. Clare.
 
"Im not going, thank you."
 
"I do wish St. Clare ever would go to church," said Marie "but he
hasnt a particle of religion about him. It really isnt respectable."
 
"I know it," said St. Clare. "You ladies go to church to learn how to
get along in the world, I suppose, and your piety sheds respectability
on us. If I did go at all, I would go where Mammy goes theres
something to keep a fellow awake there, at least."
 
"What! those shouting Methodists? Horrible!" said Marie.
 
"Anything but the dead sea of your respectable churches, Marie.
Positively, its too much to ask of a man. Eva, do you like to go? Come,
stay at home and play with me."
 
"Thank you, papa but Id rather go to church."
 
"Isnt it dreadful tiresome?" said St. Clare.
 
"I think it is tiresome, some," said Eva, "and I am sleepy, too, but I
try to keep awake."
 
"What do you go for, then?"
 
"Why, you know, papa," she said, in a whisper, "cousin told me that God
wants to have us and he gives us everything, you know and it isnt
much to do it, if he wants us to. It isnt so very tiresome after all."
 
"You sweet, little obliging soul!" said St. Clare, kissing her "go
along, thats a good girl, and pray for me."
 
"Certainly, I always do," said the child, as she sprang after her mother
into the carriage.
 
St. Clare stood on the steps and kissed his hand to her, as the carriage
drove away large tears were in his eyes.
 
"O, Evangeline! rightly named," he said "hath not God made thee an
evangel to me?"
 
So he felt a moment and then he smoked a cigar, and read the Picayune,
and forgot his little gospel. Was he much unlike other folks?
 
"You see, Evangeline," said her mother, "its always right and proper
to be kind to servants, but it isnt proper to treat them _just_ as we
would our relations, or people in our own class of life. Now, if Mammy
was sick, you wouldnt want to put her in your own bed."
 
"I should feel just like it, mamma," said Eva, "because then it would
be handier to take care of her, and because, you know, my bed is better
than hers."
 
Marie was in utter despair at the entire want of moral perception
evinced in this reply.
 
"What can I do to make this child understand me?" she said.
 
"Nothing," said Miss Ophelia, significantly.
 
Eva looked sorry and disconcerted for a moment but children, luckily,
do not keep to one impression long, and in a few moments she was merrily
laughing at various things which she saw from the coachwindows, as it
rattled along.
 

 
"Well, ladies," said St. Clare, as they were comfortably seated at the
dinnertable, "and what was the bill of fare at church today?"
 
"O, Dr. G preached a splendid sermon," said Marie. "It was just such
a sermon as you ought to hear it expressed all my views exactly."
 
"It must have been very improving," said St. Clare. "The subject must
have been an extensive one."
 
"Well, I mean all my views about society, and such things," said Marie.
"The text was, He hath made everything beautiful in its season and he
showed how all the orders and distinctions in society came from God and
that it was so appropriate, you know, and beautiful, that some should
be high and some low, and that some were born to rule and some to serve,
and all that, you know and he applied it so well to all this ridiculous
fuss that is made about slavery, and he proved distinctly that the Bible
was on our side, and supported all our institutions so convincingly. I
only wish youd heard him."
 
"O, I didnt need it," said St. Clare. "I can learn what does me as much
good as that from the Picayune, any time, and smoke a cigar besides
which I cant do, you know, in a church."
 
"Why," said Miss Ophelia, "dont you believe in these views?"
 
"Who,I? You know Im such a graceless dog that these religious aspects
of such subjects dont edify me much. If I was to say anything on this
slavery matter, I would say out, fair and square, Were in for it
weve got em, and mean to keep em,its for our convenience and our
interest for thats the long and short of it,thats just the whole
of what all this sanctified stuff amounts to, after all and I think
that it will be intelligible to everybody, everywhere."
 
"I do think, Augustine, you are so irreverent!" said Marie. "I think
its shocking to hear you talk."
 
"Shocking! its the truth. This religious talk on such matters,why
dont they carry it a little further, and show the beauty, in its
season, of a fellows taking a glass too much, and sitting a little too
late over his cards, and various providential arrangements of that sort,
which are pretty frequent among us young menwed like to hear that
those are right and godly, too."
 
"Well," said Miss Ophelia, "do you think slavery right or wrong?"
 
"Im not going to have any of your horrid New England directness,
cousin," said St. Clare, gayly. "If I answer that question, I know
youll be at me with half a dozen others, each one harder than the last
and Im not a going to define my position. I am one of the sort that
lives by throwing stones at other peoples glass houses, but I never
mean to put up one for them to stone."
 
"Thats just the way hes always talking," said Marie "you cant get
any satisfaction out of him. I believe its just because he dont like
religion, that hes always running out in this way hes been doing."
 
"Religion!" said St. Clare, in a tone that made both ladies look at him.
"Religion! Is what you hear at church, religion? Is that which can bend
and turn, and descend and ascend, to fit every crooked phase of selfish,
worldly society, religion? Is that religion which is less scrupulous,
less generous, less just, less considerate for man, than even my own
ungodly, worldly, blinded nature? No! When I look for a religion, I must
look for something above me, and not something beneath."
 
"Then you dont believe that the Bible justifies slavery," said Miss
Ophelia.
 
"The Bible was my _mothers_ book," said St. Clare. "By it she lived and
died, and I would be very sorry to think it did. Id as soon desire
to have it proved that my mother could drink brandy, chew tobacco, and
swear, by way of satisfying me that I did right in doing the same. It
wouldnt make me at all more satisfied with these things in myself, and
it would take from me the comfort of respecting her and it really is a
comfort, in this world, to have anything one can respect. In short,
you see," said he, suddenly resuming his gay tone, "all I want is that
different things be kept in different boxes. The whole framework of
society, both in Europe and America, is made up of various things which
will not stand the scrutiny of any very ideal standard of morality. Its
pretty generally understood that men dont aspire after the absolute
right, but only to do about as well as the rest of the world. Now, when
any one speaks up, like a man, and says slavery is necessary to us, we
cant get along without it, we should be beggared if we give it up,
and, of course, we mean to hold on to it,this is strong, clear,
welldefined language it has the respectability of truth to it and, if
we may judge by their practice, the majority of the world will bear us
out in it. But when he begins to put on a long face, and snuffle, and
quote Scripture, I incline to think he isnt much better than he should
be."
 
"You are very uncharitable," said Marie.
 
"Well," said St. Clare, "suppose that something should bring down the
price of cotton once and forever, and make the whole slave property a
drug in the market, dont you think we should soon have another version
of the Scripture doctrine? What a flood of light would pour into the
church, all at once, and how immediately it would be discovered that
everything in the Bible and reason went the other way!"
 
"Well, at any rate," said Marie, as she reclined herself on a lounge,
"Im thankful Im born where slavery exists and I believe its
right,indeed, I feel it must be and, at any rate, Im sure I couldnt
get along without it."
 
"I say, what do you think, Pussy?" said her father to Eva, who came in
at this moment, with a flower in her hand.
 
"What about, papa?"
 
"Why, which do you like the best,to live as they do at your uncles,
up in Vermont, or to have a housefull of servants, as we do?"
 
"O, of course, our way is the pleasantest," said Eva.
 
"Why so?" said St. Clare, stroking her head.
 
"Why, it makes so many more round you to love, you know," said Eva,
looking up earnestly.
 
"Now, thats just like Eva," said Marie "just one of her odd speeches."
 
"Is it an odd speech, papa?" said Eva, whisperingly, as she got upon his
knee.
 
"Rather, as this world goes, Pussy," said St. Clare. "But where has my
little Eva been, all dinnertime?"
 
"O, Ive been up in Toms room, hearing him sing, and Aunt Dinah gave me
my dinner."
 
"Hearing Tom sing, hey?"
 
"O, yes! he sings such beautiful things about the New Jerusalem, and
bright angels, and the land of Canaan."
 
"I dare say its better than the opera, isnt it?"
 
"Yes, and hes going to teach them to me."
 
"Singing lessons, hey?you _are_ coming on."
 
"Yes, he sings for me, and I read to him in my Bible and he explains
what it means, you know."
 
"On my word," said Marie, laughing, "that is the latest joke of the
season."
 
"Tom isnt a bad hand, now, at explaining Scripture, Ill dare swear,"
said St. Clare. "Tom has a natural genius for religion. I wanted the
horses out early, this morning, and I stole up to Toms cubiculum there,
over the stables, and there I heard him holding a meeting by himself
and, in fact, I havent heard anything quite so savory as Toms prayer,
this some time. He put in for me, with a zeal that was quite apostolic."
 
"Perhaps he guessed you were listening. Ive heard of that trick
before."
 
"If he did, he wasnt very polite for he gave the Lord his opinion
of me, pretty freely. Tom seemed to think there was decidedly room for
improvement in me, and seemed very earnest that I should be converted."
 
"I hope youll lay it to heart," said Miss Ophelia.
 
"I suppose you are much of the same opinion," said St. Clare. "Well, we
shall see,shant we, Eva?"
 
 
 
CHAPTER XVII
 
The Freemans Defence
 
 
There was a gentle bustle at the Quaker house, as the afternoon drew to
a close. Rachel Halliday moved quietly to and fro, collecting from her
household stores such needments as could be arranged in the smallest
compass, for the wanderers who were to go forth that night. The
afternoon shadows stretched eastward, and the round red sun stood
thoughtfully on the horizon, and his beams shone yellow and calm into
the little bedroom where George and his wife were sitting. He was
sitting with his child on his knee, and his wifes hand in his. Both
looked thoughtful and serious and traces of tears were on their cheeks.
 
"Yes, Eliza," said George, "I know all you say is true. You are a good
child,a great deal better than I am and I will try to do as you say.
Ill try to act worthy of a free man. Ill try to feel like a Christian.
God Almighty knows that Ive meant to do well,tried hard to do
well,when everything has been against me and now Ill forget all the
past, and put away every hard and bitter feeling, and read my Bible, and
learn to be a good man."
 
"And when we get to Canada," said Eliza, "I can help you. I can do
dressmaking very well and I understand fine washing and ironing and
between us we can find something to live on."
 
"Yes, Eliza, so long as we have each other and our boy. O! Eliza, if
these people only knew what a blessing it is for a man to feel that
his wife and child belong to _him_! Ive often wondered to see men that
could call their wives and children _their own_ fretting and worrying
about anything else. Why, I feel rich and strong, though we have nothing
but our bare hands. I feel as if I could scarcely ask God for any more.
Yes, though Ive worked hard every day, till I am twentyfive years old,
and have not a cent of money, nor a roof to cover me, nor a spot of
land to call my own, yet, if they will only let me alone now, I will be
satisfied,thankful I will work, and send back the money for you and
my boy. As to my old master, he has been paid five times over for all he
ever spent for me. I dont owe him anything."
 
"But yet we are not quite out of danger," said Eliza "we are not yet in
Canada."
 
"True," said George, "but it seems as if I smelt the free air, and it
makes me strong."
 
At this moment, voices were heard in the outer apartment, in earnest
conversation, and very soon a rap was heard on the door. Eliza started
and opened it.
 
Simeon Halliday was there, and with him a Quaker brother, whom he
introduced as Phineas Fletcher. Phineas was tall and lathy, redhaired,
with an expression of great acuteness and shrewdness in his face. He
had not the placid, quiet, unworldly air of Simeon Halliday on the
contrary, a particularly wideawake and _au fait_ appearance, like a
man who rather prides himself on knowing what he is about, and keeping
a bright lookout ahead peculiarities which sorted rather oddly with his
broad brim and formal phraseology.
 
"Our friend Phineas hath discovered something of importance to the
interests of thee and thy party, George," said Simeon "it were well for
thee to hear it."
 
"That I have," said Phineas, "and it shows the use of a mans always
sleeping with one ear open, in certain places, as Ive always said.
Last night I stopped at a little lone tavern, back on the road. Thee
remembers the place, Simeon, where we sold some apples, last year, to
that fat woman, with the great earrings. Well, I was tired with hard
driving and, after my supper I stretched myself down on a pile of bags
in the corner, and pulled a buffalo over me, to wait till my bed was
ready and what does I do, but get fast asleep."
 
"With one ear open, Phineas?" said Simeon, quietly.
 
"No I slept, ears and all, for an hour or two, for I was pretty well
tired but when I came to myself a little, I found that there were some
men in the room, sitting round a table, drinking and talking and I
thought, before I made much muster, Id just see what they were up to,
especially as I heard them say something about the Quakers. So, says
one, they are up in the Quaker settlement, no doubt, says he. Then I
listened with both ears, and I found that they were talking about this
very party. So I lay and heard them lay off all their plans. This young
man, they said, was to be sent back to Kentucky, to his master, who was
going to make an example of him, to keep all niggers from running away
and his wife two of them were going to run down to New Orleans to sell,
on their own account, and they calculated to get sixteen or eighteen
hundred dollars for her and the child, they said, was going to a
trader, who had bought him and then there was the boy, Jim, and his
mother, they were to go back to their masters in Kentucky. They said
that there were two constables, in a town a little piece ahead, who
would go in with em to get em taken up, and the young woman was to
be taken before a judge and one of the fellows, who is small and
smoothspoken, was to swear to her for his property, and get her
delivered over to him to take south. Theyve got a right notion of the
track we are going tonight and theyll be down after us, six or eight
strong. So now, whats to be done?"
 
The group that stood in various attitudes, after this communication,
were worthy of a painter. Rachel Halliday, who had taken her hands out
of a batch of biscuit, to hear the news, stood with them upraised and
floury, and with a face of the deepest concern. Simeon looked profoundly
thoughtful Eliza had thrown her arms around her husband, and was
looking up to him. George stood with clenched hands and glowing eyes,
and looking as any other man might look, whose wife was to be sold at
auction, and son sent to a trader, all under the shelter of a Christian
nations laws.
 
"What _shall_ we do, George?" said Eliza faintly.
 
"I know what _I_ shall do," said George, as he stepped into the little
room, and began examining pistols.
 
"Ay, ay," said Phineas, nodding his head to Simeon "thou seest, Simeon,
how it will work."
 
"I see," said Simeon, sighing "I pray it come not to that."
 
"I dont want to involve any one with or for me," said George. "If you
will lend me your vehicle and direct me, I will drive alone to the next
stand. Jim is a giant in strength, and brave as death and despair, and
so am I."
 
"Ah, well, friend," said Phineas, "but theell need a driver, for all
that. Thees quite welcome to do all the fighting, thee knows but I
know a thing or two about the road, that thee doesnt."
 
"But I dont want to involve you," said George.
 
"Involve," said Phineas, with a curious and keen expression of face,
"When thee does involve me, please to let me know."
 
"Phineas is a wise and skilful man," said Simeon. "Thee does well,
George, to abide by his judgment and," he added, laying his hand kindly
on Georges shoulder, and pointing to the pistols, "be not over hasty
with these,young blood is hot."
 
"I will attack no man," said George. "All I ask of this country is to be
let alone, and I will go out peaceably but,"he paused, and his brow
darkened and his face worked,"Ive had a sister sold in that New
Orleans market. I know what they are sold for and am I going to stand
by and see them take my wife and sell her, when God has given me a pair
of strong arms to defend her? No God help me! Ill fight to the last
breath, before they shall take my wife and son. Can you blame me?"
 
"Mortal man cannot blame thee, George. Flesh and blood could not do
otherwise," said Simeon. "Woe unto the world because of offences, but
woe unto them through whom the offence cometh."
 
"Would not even you, sir, do the same, in my place?"
 
"I pray that I be not tried," said Simeon "the flesh is weak."
 
"I think my flesh would be pretty tolerable strong, in such a case,"
said Phineas, stretching out a pair of arms like the sails of a
windmill. "I ant sure, friend George, that I shouldnt hold a fellow
for thee, if thee had any accounts to settle with him."
 
"If man should _ever_ resist evil," said Simeon, "then George should
feel free to do it now but the leaders of our people taught a more
excellent way for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of
God but it goes sorely against the corrupt will of man, and none can
receive it save they to whom it is given. Let us pray the Lord that we
be not tempted."
 
"And so _I_ do," said Phineas "but if we are tempted too muchwhy, let
them look out, thats all."
 
"Its quite plain thee wasnt born a Friend," said Simeon, smiling. "The
old nature hath its way in thee pretty strong as yet."
 
To tell the truth, Phineas had been a hearty, twofisted backwoodsman,
a vigorous hunter, and a dead shot at a buck but, having wooed a pretty
Quakeress, had been moved by the power of her charms to join the society
in his neighborhood and though he was an honest, sober, and efficient
member, and nothing particular could be alleged against him, yet the
more spiritual among them could not but discern an exceeding lack of
savor in his developments.
 
"Friend Phineas will ever have ways of his own," said Rachel Halliday,
smiling "but we all think that his heart is in the right place, after
all."
 
"Well," said George, "isnt it best that we hasten our flight?"
 
"I got up at four oclock, and came on with all speed, full two or three
hours ahead of them, if they start at the time they planned. It isnt
safe to start till dark, at any rate for there are some evil persons
in the villages ahead, that might be disposed to meddle with us, if they
saw our wagon, and that would delay us more than the waiting but in
two hours I think we may venture. I will go over to Michael Cross, and
engage him to come behind on his swift nag, and keep a bright lookout
on the road, and warn us if any company of men come on. Michael keeps a
horse that can soon get ahead of most other horses and he could shoot
ahead and let us know, if there were any danger. I am going out now
to warn Jim and the old woman to be in readiness, and to see about the
horse. We have a pretty fair start, and stand a good chance to get to
the stand before they can come up with us. So, have good courage, friend
George this isnt the first ugly scrape that Ive been in with thy
people," said Phineas, as he closed the door.
 
"Phineas is pretty shrewd," said Simeon. "He will do the best that can
be done for thee, George."
 
"All I am sorry for," said George, "is the risk to you."
 
"Theell much oblige us, friend George, to say no more about that. What
we do we are conscience bound to do we can do no other way. And now,
mother," said he, turning to Rachel, "hurry thy preparations for these
friends, for we must not send them away fasting."
 
And while Rachel and her children were busy making corncake, and
cooking ham and chicken, and hurrying on the _et ceteras_ of the evening
meal, George and his wife sat in their little room, with their arms
folded about each other, in such talk as husband and wife have when they
know that a few hours may part them forever.
 
"Eliza," said George, "people that have friends, and houses, and lands,
and money, and all those things _cant_ love as we do, who have nothing
but each other. Till I knew you, Eliza, no creature had loved me, but my
poor, heartbroken mother and sister. I saw poor Emily that morning the
trader carried her off. She came to the corner where I was lying asleep,
and said, Poor George, your last friend is going. What will become of
you, poor boy? And I got up and threw my arms round her, and cried and
sobbed, and she cried too and those were the last kind words I got for
ten long years and my heart all withered up, and felt as dry as ashes,
till I met you. And your loving me,why, it was almost like raising one
from the dead! Ive been a new man ever since! And now, Eliza, Ill give
my last drop of blood, but they _shall not_ take you from me. Whoever
gets you must walk over my dead body."
 
"O, Lord, have mercy!" said Eliza, sobbing. "If he will only let us get
out of this country together, that is all we ask."
 
"Is God on their side?" said George, speaking less to his wife than
pouring out his own bitter thoughts. "Does he see all they do? Why does
he let such things happen? And they tell us that the Bible is on their
side certainly all the power is. They are rich, and healthy, and happy
they are members of churches, expecting to go to heaven and they get
along so easy in the world, and have it all their own way and poor,
honest, faithful Christians,Christians as good or better than
they,are lying in the very dust under their feet. They buy em
and sell em, and make trade of their hearts blood, and groans and
tears,and God _lets_ them."
 
"Friend George," said Simeon, from the kitchen, "listen to this Psalm
it may do thee good."
 
George drew his seat near the door, and Eliza, wiping her tears, came
forward also to listen, while Simeon read as follows
 
"But as for me, my feet were almost gone my steps had wellnigh
slipped. For I was envious of the foolish, when I saw the prosperity
of the wicked. They are not in trouble like other men, neither are they
plagued like other men. Therefore, pride compasseth them as a chain
violence covereth them as a garment. Their eyes stand out with fatness
they have more than heart could wish. They are corrupt, and speak
wickedly concerning oppression they speak loftily. Therefore his people
return, and the waters of a full cup are wrung out to them, and they
say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the Most High?"
 
"Is not that the way thee feels, George?"
 
"It is so indeed," said George,"as well as I could have written it
myself."
 
"Then, hear," said Simeon "When I thought to know this, it was too
painful for me until I went unto the sanctuary of God. Then understood I
their end. Surely thou didst set them in slippery places, thou castedst
them down to destruction. As a dream when one awaketh, so, oh Lord,
when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image. Nevertheless I am
continually with thee thou hast holden me by my right hand. Thou shalt
guide me by thy counsel, and afterwards receive me to glory. It is good
for me to draw near unto God. I have put my trust in the Lord God."
 
      Ps. 73, "The End of the Wicked contrasted with that of the
     Righteous."
 
The words of holy trust, breathed by the friendly old man, stole like
sacred music over the harassed and chafed spirit of George and after
he ceased, he sat with a gentle and subdued expression on his fine
features.
 
"If this world were all, George," said Simeon, "thee might, indeed, ask
where is the Lord? But it is often those who have least of all in this
life whom he chooseth for the kingdom. Put thy trust in him and, no
matter what befalls thee here, he will make all right hereafter."
 
If these words had been spoken by some easy, selfindulgent exhorter,
from whose mouth they might have come merely as pious and rhetorical
flourish, proper to be used to people in distress, perhaps they might
not have had much effect but coming from one who daily and calmly
risked fine and imprisonment for the cause of God and man, they had a
weight that could not but be felt, and both the poor, desolate fugitives
found calmness and strength breathing into them from it.
 
And now Rachel took Elizas hand kindly, and led the way to the
suppertable. As they were sitting down, a light tap sounded at the
door, and Ruth entered.
 
"I just ran in," she said, "with these little stockings for the
boy,three pair, nice, warm woollen ones. It will be so cold, thee
knows, in Canada. Does thee keep up good courage, Eliza?" she added,
tripping round to Elizas side of the table, and shaking her warmly
by the hand, and slipping a seedcake into Harrys hand. "I brought a
little parcel of these for him," she said, tugging at her pocket to get
out the package. "Children, thee knows, will always be eating."
 
"O, thank you you are too kind," said Eliza.
 
"Come, Ruth, sit down to supper," said Rachel.
 
"I couldnt, any way. I left John with the baby, and some biscuits in
the oven and I cant stay a moment, else John will burn up all the
biscuits, and give the baby all the sugar in the bowl. Thats the way
he does," said the little Quakeress, laughing. "So, goodby, Eliza
goodby, George the Lord grant thee a safe journey" and, with a few
tripping steps, Ruth was out of the apartment.
 
A little while after supper, a large coveredwagon drew up before the
door the night was clear starlight and Phineas jumped briskly down
from his seat to arrange his passengers. George walked out of the door,
with his child on one arm and his wife on the other. His step was firm,
his face settled and resolute. Rachel and Simeon came out after them.
 
"You get out, a moment," said Phineas to those inside, "and let me fix
the back of the wagon, there, for the womenfolks and the boy."
 
"Here are the two buffaloes," said Rachel. "Make the seats as
comfortable as may be its hard riding all night."
 
Jim came out first, and carefully assisted out his old mother, who clung
to his arm, and looked anxiously about, as if she expected the pursuer
every moment.
 
"Jim, are your pistols all in order?" said George, in a low, firm voice.
 
"Yes, indeed," said Jim.
 
"And youve no doubt what you shall do, if they come?"
 
"I rather think I havent," said Jim, throwing open his broad chest, and
taking a deep breath. "Do you think Ill let them get mother again?"
 
During this brief colloquy, Eliza had been taking her leave of her
kind friend, Rachel, and was handed into the carriage by Simeon,
and, creeping into the back part with her boy, sat down among the
buffaloskins. The old woman was next handed in and seated and George
and Jim placed on a rough board seat front of them, and Phineas mounted
in front.
 
"Farewell, my friends," said Simeon, from without.
 
"God bless you!" answered all from within.
 
And the wagon drove off, rattling and jolting over the frozen road.
 
There was no opportunity for conversation, on account of the roughness
of the way and the noise of the wheels. The vehicle, therefore,
rumbled on, through long, dark stretches of woodland,over wide dreary
plains,up hills, and down valleys,and on, on, on they jogged, hour
after hour. The child soon fell asleep, and lay heavily in his mothers
lap. The poor, frightened old woman at last forgot her fears and, even
Eliza, as the night waned, found all her anxieties insufficient to keep
her eyes from closing. Phineas seemed, on the whole, the briskest of
the company, and beguiled his long drive with whistling certain very
unquakerlike songs, as he went on.
 
But about three oclock Georges ear caught the hasty and decided click
of a horses hoof coming behind them at some distance and jogged Phineas
by the elbow. Phineas pulled up his horses, and listened.
 
"That must be Michael," he said "I think I know the sound of his
gallop" and he rose up and stretched his head anxiously back over the
road.
 
A man riding in hot haste was now dimly descried at the top of a distant
hill.
 
"There he is, I do believe!" said Phineas. George and Jim both sprang
out of the wagon before they knew what they were doing. All stood
intensely silent, with their faces turned towards the expected
messenger. On he came. Now he went down into a valley, where they could
not see him but they heard the sharp, hasty tramp, rising nearer and
nearer at last they saw him emerge on the top of an eminence, within
hail.
 
"Yes, thats Michael!" said Phineas and, raising his voice, "Halloa,
there, Michael!"
 
"Phineas! is that thee?"
 
"Yes what newsthey coming?"
 
"Right on behind, eight or ten of them, hot with brandy, swearing and
foaming like so many wolves."
 
And, just as he spoke, a breeze brought the faint sound of galloping
horsemen towards them.
 
"In with you,quick, boys, _in!_" said Phineas. "If you must fight,
wait till I get you a piece ahead." And, with the word, both jumped
in, and Phineas lashed the horses to a run, the horseman keeping close
beside them. The wagon rattled, jumped, almost flew, over the frozen
ground but plainer, and still plainer, came the noise of pursuing
horsemen behind. The women heard it, and, looking anxiously out, saw,
far in the rear, on the brow of a distant hill, a party of men looming
up against the redstreaked sky of early dawn. Another hill, and
their pursuers had evidently caught sight of their wagon, whose white
clothcovered top made it conspicuous at some distance, and a loud yell
of brutal triumph came forward on the wind. Eliza sickened, and strained
her child closer to her bosom the old woman prayed and groaned, and
George and Jim clenched their pistols with the grasp of despair. The
pursuers gained on them fast the carriage made a sudden turn, and
brought them near a ledge of a steep overhanging rock, that rose in an
isolated ridge or clump in a large lot, which was, all around it, quite
clear and smooth. This isolated pile, or range of rocks, rose up black
and heavy against the brightening sky, and seemed to promise shelter and
concealment. It was a place well known to Phineas, who had been familiar
with the spot in his hunting days and it was to gain this point he had
been racing his horses.
 
"Now for it!" said he, suddenly checking his horses, and springing from
his seat to the ground. "Out with you, in a twinkling, every one, and up
into these rocks with me. Michael, thee tie thy horse to the wagon, and
drive ahead to Amariahs and get him and his boys to come back and talk
to these fellows."
 
In a twinkling they were all out of the carriage.
 
"There," said Phineas, catching up Harry, "you, each of you, see to the
women and run, _now_ if you ever _did_ run!"
 
They needed no exhortation. Quicker than we can say it, the whole party
were over the fence, making with all speed for the rocks, while Michael,
throwing himself from his horse, and fastening the bridle to the wagon,
began driving it rapidly away.
 
"Come ahead," said Phineas, as they reached the rocks, and saw in the
mingled starlight and dawn, the traces of a rude but plainly marked
footpath leading up among them "this is one of our old huntingdens.
Come up!"
 
Phineas went before, springing up the rocks like a goat, with the boy
in his arms. Jim came second, bearing his trembling old mother over
his shoulder, and George and Eliza brought up the rear. The party of
horsemen came up to the fence, and, with mingled shouts and oaths,
were dismounting, to prepare to follow them. A few moments scrambling
brought them to the top of the ledge the path then passed between a
narrow defile, where only one could walk at a time, till suddenly they
came to a rift or chasm more than a yard in breadth, and beyond which
lay a pile of rocks, separate from the rest of the ledge, standing full
thirty feet high, with its sides steep and perpendicular as those of
a castle. Phineas easily leaped the chasm, and sat down the boy on a
smooth, flat platform of crisp white moss, that covered the top of the
rock.
 
"Over with you!" he called "spring, now, once, for your lives!" said
he, as one after another sprang across. Several fragments of loose stone
formed a kind of breastwork, which sheltered their position from the
observation of those below.
 
"Well, here we all are," said Phineas, peeping over the stone
breastwork to watch the assailants, who were coming tumultuously up
under the rocks. "Let em get us, if they can. Whoever comes here has to
walk single file between those two rocks, in fair range of your pistols,
boys, dye see?"
 
"I do see," said George! "and now, as this matter is ours, let us take
all the risk, and do all the fighting."
 
"Thees quite welcome to do the fighting, George," said Phineas, chewing
some checkerberryleaves as he spoke "but I may have the fun of looking
on, I suppose. But see, these fellows are kinder debating down there,
and looking up, like hens when they are going to fly up on to the roost.
Hadnt thee better give em a word of advice, before they come up, just
to tell em handsomely theyll be shot if they do?"
 
The party beneath, now more apparent in the light of the dawn, consisted
of our old acquaintances, Tom Loker and Marks, with two constables,
and a posse consisting of such rowdies at the last tavern as could be
engaged by a little brandy to go and help the fun of trapping a set of
niggers.
 
"Well, Tom, yer coons are farly treed," said one.
 
"Yes, I see em go up right here," said Tom "and heres a path. Im for
going right up. They cant jump down in a hurry, and it wont take long
to ferret em out."
 
"But, Tom, they might fire at us from behind the rocks," said Marks.
"That would be ugly, you know."
 
"Ugh!" said Tom, with a sneer. "Always for saving your skin, Marks! No
danger! niggers are too plaguy scared!"
 
"I dont know why I _shouldnt_ save my skin," said Marks. "Its the
best Ive got and niggers _do_ fight like the devil, sometimes."
 
At this moment, George appeared on the top of a rock above them, and,
speaking in a calm, clear voice, said,
 
"Gentlemen, who are you, down there, and what do you want?"
 
"We want a party of runaway niggers," said Tom Loker. "One George
Harris, and Eliza Harris, and their son, and Jim Selden, and an old
woman. Weve got the officers, here, and a warrant to take em and
were going to have em, too. Dye hear? Ant you George Harris, that
belongs to Mr. Harris, of Shelby county, Kentucky?"
 
"I am George Harris. A Mr. Harris, of Kentucky, did call me his
property. But now Im a free man, standing on Gods free soil and my
wife and my child I claim as mine. Jim and his mother are here. We have
arms to defend ourselves, and we mean to do it. You can come up, if
you like but the first one of you that comes within the range of our
bullets is a dead man, and the next, and the next and so on till the
last."
 
"O, come! come!" said a short, puffy man, stepping forward, and blowing
his nose as he did so. "Young man, this ant no kind of talk at all for
you. You see, were officers of justice. Weve got the law on our side,
and the power, and so forth so youd better give up peaceably, you see
for youll certainly have to give up, at last."
 
"I know very well that youve got the law on your side, and the power,"
said George, bitterly. "You mean to take my wife to sell in New Orleans,
and put my boy like a calf in a traders pen, and send Jims old mother
to the brute that whipped and abused her before, because he couldnt
abuse her son. You want to send Jim and me back to be whipped and
tortured, and ground down under the heels of them that you call masters
and your laws _will_ bear you out in it,more shame for you and them!
But you havent got us. We dont own your laws we dont own your
country we stand here as free, under Gods sky, as you are and, by the
great God that made us, well fight for our liberty till we die."
 
George stood out in fair sight, on the top of the rock, as he made
his declaration of independence the glow of dawn gave a flush to his
swarthy cheek, and bitter indignation and despair gave fire to his dark
eye and, as if appealing from man to the justice of God, he raised his
hand to heaven as he spoke.
 
If it had been only a Hungarian youth, now bravely defending in some
mountain fastness the retreat of fugitives escaping from Austria into
America, this would have been sublime heroism but as it was a youth of
African descent, defending the retreat of fugitives through America into
Canada, of course we are too well instructed and patriotic to see any
heroism in it and if any of our readers do, they must do it on their
own private responsibility. When despairing Hungarian fugitives make
their way, against all the searchwarrants and authorities of their
lawful government, to America, press and political cabinet ring with
applause and welcome. When despairing African fugitives do the same
thing,it iswhat _is_ it?
 
Be it as it may, it is certain that the attitude, eye, voice, manner,
of the speaker for a moment struck the party below to silence. There is
something in boldness and determination that for a time hushes even the
rudest nature. Marks was the only one who remained wholly untouched. He
was deliberately cocking his pistol, and, in the momentary silence that
followed Georges speech, he fired at him.
 
"Ye see ye get jist as much for him dead as alive in Kentucky," he said
coolly, as he wiped his pistol on his coatsleeve.
 
George sprang backward,Eliza uttered a shriek,the ball had passed
close to his hair, had nearly grazed the cheek of his wife, and struck
in the tree above.
 
"Its nothing, Eliza," said George, quickly.
 
"Theed better keep out of sight, with thy speechifying," said Phineas
"theyre mean scamps."
 
"Now, Jim," said George, "look that your pistols are all right, and
watch that pass with me. The first man that shows himself I fire at you
take the second, and so on. It wont do, you know, to waste two shots on
one."
 
"But what if you dont hit?"
 
"I _shall_ hit," said George, coolly.
 
"Good! now, theres stuff in that fellow," muttered Phineas, between his
teeth.
 
The party below, after Marks had fired, stood, for a moment, rather
undecided.
 
"I think you must have hit some on em," said one of the men. "I heard a
squeal!"
 
"Im going right up for one," said Tom. "I never was afraid of niggers,
and I ant going to be now. Who goes after?" he said, springing up the
rocks.
 
George heard the words distinctly. He drew up his pistol, examined it,
pointed it towards that point in the defile where the first man would
appear.
 
One of the most courageous of the party followed Tom, and, the way being
thus made, the whole party began pushing up the rock,the hindermost
pushing the front ones faster than they would have gone of themselves.
On they came, and in a moment the burly form of Tom appeared in sight,
almost at the verge of the chasm.
 
George fired,the shot entered his side,but, though wounded, he would
not retreat, but, with a yell like that of a mad bull, he was leaping
right across the chasm into the party.
 
"Friend," said Phineas, suddenly stepping to the front, and meeting him
with a push from his long arms, "thee isnt wanted here."
 
Down he fell into the chasm, crackling down among trees, bushes, logs,
loose stones, till he lay bruised and groaning thirty feet below. The
fall might have killed him, had it not been broken and moderated by his
clothes catching in the branches of a large tree but he came down with
some force, however,more than was at all agreeable or convenient.
 
"Lord help us, they are perfect devils!" said Marks, heading the retreat
down the rocks with much more of a will than he had joined the ascent,
while all the party came tumbling precipitately after him,the fat
constable, in particular, blowing and puffing in a very energetic
manner.
 
"I say, fellers," said Marks, "you jist go round and pick up Tom, there,
while I run and get on to my horse to go back for help,thats you"
and, without minding the hootings and jeers of his company, Marks was as
good as his word, and was soon seen galloping away.
 
"Was ever such a sneaking varmint?" said one of the men "to come on his
business, and he clear out and leave us this yer way!"
 
"Well, we must pick up that feller," said another. "Cuss me if I much
care whether he is dead or alive."
 
The men, led by the groans of Tom, scrambled and crackled through
stumps, logs and bushes, to where that hero lay groaning and swearing
with alternate vehemence.
 
"Ye keep it agoing pretty loud, Tom," said one. "Ye much hurt?"
 
"Dont know. Get me up, cant ye? Blast that infernal Quaker! If it
hadnt been for him, Id a pitched some on em down here, to see how
they liked it."
 
With much labor and groaning, the fallen hero was assisted to rise and,
with one holding him up under each shoulder, they got him as far as the
horses.
 
"If you could only get me a mile back to that ar tavern. Give me a
handkerchief or something, to stuff into this place, and stop this
infernal bleeding."
 
George looked over the rocks, and saw them trying to lift the burly
form of Tom into the saddle. After two or three ineffectual attempts, he
reeled, and fell heavily to the ground.
 
"O, I hope he isnt killed!" said Eliza, who, with all the party, stood
watching the proceeding.
 
"Why not?" said Phineas "serves him right."
 
"Because after death comes the judgment," said Eliza.
 
"Yes," said the old woman, who had been groaning and praying, in her
Methodist fashion, during all the encounter, "its an awful case for the
poor critturs soul."
 
"On my word, theyre leaving him, I do believe," said Phineas.
 
It was true for after some appearance of irresolution and consultation,
the whole party got on their horses and rode away. When they were quite
out of sight, Phineas began to bestir himself.
 
"Well, we must go down and walk a piece," he said. "I told Michael to
go forward and bring help, and be along back here with the wagon but we
shall have to walk a piece along the road, I reckon, to meet them. The
Lord grant he be along soon! Its early in the day there wont be much
travel afoot yet a while we ant much more than two miles from our
stoppingplace. If the road hadnt been so rough last night, we could
have outrun em entirely."
 
As the party neared the fence, they discovered in the distance, along
the road, their own wagon coming back, accompanied by some men on
horseback.
 
"Well, now, theres Michael, and Stephen and Amariah," exclaimed
Phineas, joyfully. "Now we _are_ madeas safe as if wed got there."
 
"Well, do stop, then," said Eliza, "and do something for that poor man
hes groaning dreadfully."
 
"It would be no more than Christian," said George "lets take him up
and carry him on."
 
"And doctor him up among the Quakers!" said Phineas "pretty well,
that! Well, I dont care if we do. Here, lets have a look at him"
and Phineas, who in the course of his hunting and backwoods life had
acquired some rude experience of surgery, kneeled down by the wounded
man, and began a careful examination of his condition.
 
"Marks," said Tom, feebly, "is that you, Marks?"
 
"No I reckon tant friend," said Phineas. "Much Marks cares for thee,
if his own skins safe. Hes off, long ago."
 
"I believe Im done for," said Tom. "The cussed sneaking dog, to leave
me to die alone! My poor old mother always told me t would be so."
 
"La sakes! jist hear the poor crittur. Hes got a mammy, now," said the
old negress. "I cant help kinder pityin on him."
 
"Softly, softly dont thee snap and snarl, friend," said Phineas, as
Tom winced and pushed his hand away. "Thee has no chance, unless I stop
the bleeding." And Phineas busied himself with making some offhand
surgical arrangements with his own pockethandkerchief, and such as
could be mustered in the company.
 
"You pushed me down there," said Tom, faintly.
 
"Well if I hadnt thee would have pushed us down, thee sees," said
Phineas, as he stooped to apply his bandage. "There, there,let me fix
this bandage. We mean well to thee we bear no malice. Thee shall be
taken to a house where theyll nurse thee first rate, well as thy own
mother could."
 
Tom groaned, and shut his eyes. In men of his class, vigor and
resolution are entirely a physical matter, and ooze out with the flowing
of the blood and the gigantic fellow really looked piteous in his
helplessness.
 
The other party now came up. The seats were taken out of the wagon. The
buffaloskins, doubled in fours, were spread all along one side, and
four men, with great difficulty, lifted the heavy form of Tom into it.
Before he was gotten in, he fainted entirely. The old negress, in the
abundance of her compassion, sat down on the bottom, and took his head
in her lap. Eliza, George and Jim, bestowed themselves, as well as they
could, in the remaining space and the whole party set forward.
 
"What do you think of him?" said George, who sat by Phineas in front.
 
"Well its only a pretty deep fleshwound but, then, tumbling and
scratching down that place didnt help him much. It has bled pretty
freely,pretty much drained him out, courage and all,but hell get
over it, and may be learn a thing or two by it."
 
"Im glad to hear you say so," said George. "It would always be a heavy
thought to me, if Id caused his death, even in a just cause."
 
"Yes," said Phineas, "killing is an ugly operation, any way theyll fix
it,man or beast. Ive seen a buck that was shot down and a dying, look
that way on a feller with his eye, that it reely most made a feller
feel wicked for killing on him and human creatures is a more serious
consideration yet, bein, as thy wife says, that the judgment comes
to em after death. So I dont know as our peoples notions on these
matters is too strict and, considerin how I was raised, I fell in with
them pretty considerably."
 
"What shall you do with this poor fellow?" said George.
 
"O, carry him along to Amariahs. Theres old Grandmam Stephens
there,Dorcas, they call her,shes most an amazin nurse. She takes
to nursing real natural, and ant never better suited than when she
gets a sick body to tend. We may reckon on turning him over to her for a
fortnight or so."
 
A ride of about an hour more brought the party to a neat farmhouse,
where the weary travellers were received to an abundant breakfast. Tom
Loker was soon carefully deposited in a much cleaner and softer bed than
he had ever been in the habit of occupying. His wound was carefully
dressed and bandaged, and he lay languidly opening and shutting his
eyes on the white windowcurtains and gentlygliding figures of his sick
room, like a weary child. And here, for the present, we shall take our
leave of one party.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XVIII
 
Miss Ophelias Experiences and Opinions
 
 
Our friend Tom, in his own simple musings, often compared his more
fortunate lot, in the bondage into which he was cast, with that of
Joseph in Egypt and, in fact, as time went on, and he developed more
and more under the eye of his master, the strength of the parallel
increased.
 
St. Clare was indolent and careless of money. Hitherto the providing and
marketing had been principally done by Adolph, who was, to the full, as
careless and extravagant as his master and, between them both, they had
carried on the dispersing process with great alacrity. Accustomed, for
many years, to regard his masters property as his own care, Tom saw,
with an uneasiness he could scarcely repress, the wasteful expenditure
of the establishment and, in the quiet, indirect way which his class
often acquire, would sometimes make his own suggestions.
 
St. Clare at first employed him occasionally but, struck with his
soundness of mind and good business capacity, he confided in him more
and more, till gradually all the marketing and providing for the family
were intrusted to him.
 
"No, no, Adolph," he said, one day, as Adolph was deprecating the
passing of power out of his hands "let Tom alone. You only understand
what you want Tom understands cost and come to and there may be some
end to money, bye and bye if we dont let somebody do that."
 
Trusted to an unlimited extent by a careless master, who handed him a
bill without looking at it, and pocketed the change without counting it,
Tom had every facility and temptation to dishonesty and nothing but an
impregnable simplicity of nature, strengthened by Christian faith, could
have kept him from it. But, to that nature, the very unbounded trust
reposed in him was bond and seal for the most scrupulous accuracy.
 
With Adolph the case had been different. Thoughtless and selfindulgent,
and unrestrained by a master who found it easier to indulge than to
regulate, he had fallen into an absolute confusion as to _meum tuum_
with regard to himself and his master, which sometimes troubled even
St. Clare. His own good sense taught him that such a training of his
servants was unjust and dangerous. A sort of chronic remorse went with
him everywhere, although not strong enough to make any decided change
in his course and this very remorse reacted again into indulgence. He
passed lightly over the most serious faults, because he told himself
that, if he had done his part, his dependents had not fallen into them.
 
Tom regarded his gay, airy, handsome young master with an odd mixture
of fealty, reverence, and fatherly solicitude. That he never read the
Bible never went to church that he jested and made free with any and
every thing that came in the way of his wit that he spent his Sunday
evenings at the opera or theatre that he went to wine parties, and
clubs, and suppers, oftener than was at all expedient,were all things
that Tom could see as plainly as anybody, and on which he based a
conviction that "Masr wasnt a Christian"a conviction, however,
which he would have been very slow to express to any one else, but on
which he founded many prayers, in his own simple fashion, when he was
by himself in his little dormitory. Not that Tom had not his own way
of speaking his mind occasionally, with something of the tact often
observable in his class as, for example, the very day after the Sabbath
we have described, St. Clare was invited out to a convivial party of
choice spirits, and was helped home, between one and two oclock at
night, in a condition when the physical had decidedly attained the upper
hand of the intellectual. Tom and Adolph assisted to get him composed
for the night, the latter in high spirits, evidently regarding the
matter as a good joke, and laughing heartily at the rusticity of Toms
horror, who really was simple enough to lie awake most of the rest of
the night, praying for his young master.
 
"Well, Tom, what are you waiting for?" said St. Clare, the next day, as
he sat in his library, in dressinggown and slippers. St. Clare had just
been entrusting Tom with some money, and various commissions. "Isnt all
right there, Tom?" he added, as Tom still stood waiting.
 
"Im fraid not, Masr," said Tom, with a grave face.
 
St. Clare laid down his paper, and set down his coffeecup, and looked
at Tom.
 
"Why Tom, whats the case? You look as solemn as a coffin."
 
"I feel very bad, Masr. I allays have thought that Masr would be good
to everybody."
 
"Well, Tom, havent I been? Come, now, what do you want? Theres
something you havent got, I suppose, and this is the preface."
 
"Masr allays been good to me. I havent nothing to complain of on that
head. But there is one that Masr isnt good to."
 
"Why, Tom, whats got into you? Speak out what do you mean?"
 
"Last night, between one and two, I thought so. I studied upon the
matter then. Masr isnt good to _himself_."
 
Tom said this with his back to his master, and his hand on the
doorknob. St. Clare felt his face flush crimson, but he laughed.
 
"O, thats all, is it?" he said, gayly.
 
"All!" said Tom, turning suddenly round and falling on his knees. "O,
my dear young Masr Im fraid it will be _loss of allall_body and
soul. The good Book says, it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an
adder! my dear Masr!"
 
Toms voice choked, and the tears ran down his cheeks.
 
"You poor, silly fool!" said St. Clare, with tears in his own eyes. "Get
up, Tom. Im not worth crying over."
 
But Tom wouldnt rise, and looked imploring.
 
"Well, I wont go to any more of their cursed nonsense, Tom," said St.
Clare "on my honor, I wont. I dont know why I havent stopped long
ago. Ive always despised _it_, and myself for it,so now, Tom, wipe
up your eyes, and go about your errands. Come, come," he added, "no
blessings. Im not so wonderfully good, now," he said, as he gently
pushed Tom to the door. "There, Ill pledge my honor to you, Tom, you
dont see me so again," he said and Tom went off, wiping his eyes, with
great satisfaction.
 
"Ill keep my faith with him, too," said St. Clare, as he closed the
door.
 
And St. Clare did so,for gross sensualism, in any form, was not the
peculiar temptation of his nature.
 
But, all this time, who shall detail the tribulations manifold of our
friend Miss Ophelia, who had begun the labors of a Southern housekeeper?
 
There is all the difference in the world in the servants of Southern
establishments, according to the character and capacity of the
mistresses who have brought them up.
 
South as well as north, there are women who have an extraordinary talent
for command, and tact in educating. Such are enabled, with apparent
ease, and without severity, to subject to their will, and bring into
harmonious and systematic order, the various members of their small
estate,to regulate their peculiarities, and so balance and compensate
the deficiencies of one by the excess of another, as to produce a
harmonious and orderly system.
 
Such a housekeeper was Mrs. Shelby, whom we have already described and
such our readers may remember to have met with. If they are not common
at the South, it is because they are not common in the world. They are
to be found there as often as anywhere and, when existing, find in
that peculiar state of society a brilliant opportunity to exhibit their
domestic talent.
 
Such a housekeeper Marie St. Clare was not, nor her mother before her.
Indolent and childish, unsystematic and improvident, it was not to be
expected that servants trained under her care should not be so likewise
and she had very justly described to Miss Ophelia the state of confusion
she would find in the family, though she had not ascribed it to the
proper cause.
 
The first morning of her regency, Miss Ophelia was up at four oclock
and having attended to all the adjustments of her own chamber, as
she had done ever since she came there, to the great amazement of the
chambermaid, she prepared for a vigorous onslaught on the cupboards and
closets of the establishment of which she had the keys.
 
The storeroom, the linenpresses, the chinacloset, the kitchen and
cellar, that day, all went under an awful review. Hidden things of
darkness were brought to light to an extent that alarmed all the
principalities and powers of kitchen and chamber, and caused many
wonderings and murmurings about "dese yer northern ladies" from the
domestic cabinet.
 
Old Dinah, the head cook, and principal of all rule and authority in
the kitchen department, was filled with wrath at what she considered
an invasion of privilege. No feudal baron in _Magna Charta_ times could
have more thoroughly resented some incursion of the crown.
 
Dinah was a character in her own way, and it would be injustice to her
memory not to give the reader a little idea of her. She was a native
and essential cook, as much as Aunt Chloe,cooking being an indigenous
talent of the African race but Chloe was a trained and methodical one,
who moved in an orderly domestic harness, while Dinah was a selftaught
genius, and, like geniuses in general, was positive, opinionated and
erratic, to the last degree.
 
Like a certain class of modern philosophers, Dinah perfectly scorned
logic and reason in every shape, and always took refuge in intuitive
certainty and here she was perfectly impregnable. No possible amount of
talent, or authority, or explanation, could ever make her believe
that any other way was better than her own, or that the course she had
pursued in the smallest matter could be in the least modified. This had
been a conceded point with her old mistress, Maries mother and "Miss
Marie," as Dinah always called her young mistress, even after her
marriage, found it easier to submit than contend and so Dinah had ruled
supreme. This was the easier, in that she was perfect mistress of that
diplomatic art which unites the utmost subservience of manner with the
utmost inflexibility as to measure.
 
Dinah was mistress of the whole art and mystery of excusemaking, in all
its branches. Indeed, it was an axiom with her that the cook can do no
wrong and a cook in a Southern kitchen finds abundance of heads and
shoulders on which to lay off every sin and frailty, so as to maintain
her own immaculateness entire. If any part of the dinner was a failure,
there were fifty indisputably good reasons for it and it was the fault
undeniably of fifty other people, whom Dinah berated with unsparing
zeal.
 
But it was very seldom that there was any failure in Dinahs last
results. Though her mode of doing everything was peculiarly meandering
and circuitous, and without any sort of calculation as to time and
place,though her kitchen generally looked as if it had been arranged
by a hurricane blowing through it, and she had about as many places for
each cooking utensil as there were days in the year,yet, if one would
have patience to wait her own good time, up would come her dinner in
perfect order, and in a style of preparation with which an epicure could
find no fault.
 
It was now the season of incipient preparation for dinner. Dinah, who
required large intervals of reflection and repose, and was studious of
ease in all her arrangements, was seated on the kitchen floor, smoking a
short, stumpy pipe, to which she was much addicted, and which she
always kindled up, as a sort of censer, whenever she felt the need of
an inspiration in her arrangements. It was Dinahs mode of invoking the
domestic Muses.
 
Seated around her were various members of that rising race with which a
Southern household abounds, engaged in shelling peas, peeling
potatoes, picking pinfeathers out of fowls, and other preparatory
arrangements,Dinah every once in a while interrupting her meditations
to give a poke, or a rap on the head, to some of the young operators,
with the puddingstick that lay by her side. In fact, Dinah ruled over
the woolly heads of the younger members with a rod of iron, and seemed
to consider them born for no earthly purpose but to "save her steps,"
as she phrased it. It was the spirit of the system under which she had
grown up, and she carried it out to its full extent.
 
Miss Ophelia, after passing on her reformatory tour through all the
other parts of the establishment, now entered the kitchen. Dinah had
heard, from various sources, what was going on, and resolved to stand
on defensive and conservative ground,mentally determined to oppose and
ignore every new measure, without any actual observable contest.
 
The kitchen was a large brickfloored apartment, with a great
oldfashioned fireplace stretching along one side of it,an arrangement
which St. Clare had vainly tried to persuade Dinah to exchange for
the convenience of a modern cookstove. Not she. No Puseyite, or
conservative of any school, was ever more inflexibly attached to
timehonored inconveniences than Dinah.

     orthodoxy of revealed religion, defender of the Oxford
     movement, and Regius professor of Hebrew and Canon of Christ
     Church, Oxford.
 
When St. Clare had first returned from the north, impressed with the
system and order of his uncles kitchen arrangements, he had largely
provided his own with an array of cupboards, drawers, and various
apparatus, to induce systematic regulation, under the sanguine
illusion that it would be of any possible assistance to Dinah in her
arrangements. He might as well have provided them for a squirrel or a
magpie. The more drawers and closets there were, the more hidingholes
could Dinah make for the accommodation of old rags, haircombs, old
shoes, ribbons, castoff artificial flowers, and other articles of
_vertu_, wherein her soul delighted.
 
When Miss Ophelia entered the kitchen Dinah did not rise, but smoked on
in sublime tranquillity, regarding her movements obliquely out of the
corner of her eye, but apparently intent only on the operations around
her.
 
Miss Ophelia commenced opening a set of drawers.
 
"What is this drawer for, Dinah?" she said.
 
"Its handy for most anything, Missis," said Dinah. So it appeared to
be. From the variety it contained, Miss Ophelia pulled out first a fine
damask tablecloth stained with blood, having evidently been used to
envelop some raw meat.
 
"Whats this, Dinah? You dont wrap up meat in your mistress best
tablecloths?"
 
"O Lor, Missis, no the towels was all a missinso I jest did it. I
laid out to wash that a,thats why I put it thar."
 
"Shifless!" said Miss Ophelia to herself, proceeding to tumble over
the drawer, where she found a nutmeggrater and two or three nutmegs, a
Methodist hymnbook, a couple of soiled Madras handkerchiefs, some yarn
and knittingwork, a paper of tobacco and a pipe, a few crackers, one or
two gilded chinasaucers with some pomade in them, one or two thin old
shoes, a piece of flannel carefully pinned up enclosing some small white
onions, several damask tablenapkins, some coarse crash towels, some
twine and darningneedles, and several broken papers, from which sundry
sweet herbs were sifting into the drawer.
 
"Where do you keep your nutmegs, Dinah?" said Miss Ophelia, with the air
of one who prayed for patience.
 
"Most anywhar, Missis theres some in that cracked teacup, up there,
and theres some over in that ar cupboard."
 
"Here are some in the grater," said Miss Ophelia, holding them up.
 
"Laws, yes, I put em there this morning,I likes to keep my things
handy," said Dinah. "You, Jake! what are you stopping for! Youll
cotch it! Be still, thar!" she added, with a dive of her stick at the
criminal.
 
"Whats this?" said Miss Ophelia, holding up the saucer of pomade.
 
"Laws, its my har _grease_I put it thar to have it handy."
 
"Do you use your mistress best saucers for that?"
 
"Law! it was cause I was driv, and in sich a hurryI was gwine to
change it this very day."
 
"Here are two damask tablenapkins."
 
"Them tablenapkins I put thar, to get em washed out, some day."
 
"Dont you have some place here on purpose for things to be washed?"
 
"Well, Masr St. Clare got dat ar chest, he said, for dat but I likes
to mix up biscuit and hev my things on it some days, and then it ant
handy a liftin up the lid."
 
"Why dont you mix your biscuits on the pastrytable, there?"
 
"Law, Missis, it gets sot so full of dishes, and one thing and another,
der ant no room, noway"
 
"But you should _wash_ your dishes, and clear them away."
 
"Wash my dishes!" said Dinah, in a high key, as her wrath began to rise
over her habitual respect of manner "what does ladies know bout work,
I want to know? When d Masr ever get his dinner, if I vas to spend all
my time a washin and a puttin up dishes? Miss Marie never telled me
so, nohow."
 
"Well, here are these onions."
 
"Laws, yes!" said Dinah "thar _is_ whar I put em, now. I couldnt
member. Them s particular onions I was a savin for dis yer very stew.
Id forgot they was in dat ar old flannel."
 
Miss Ophelia lifted out the sifting papers of sweet herbs.
 
"I wish Missis wouldnt touch dem ar. I likes to keep my things where I
knows whar to go to em," said Dinah, rather decidedly.
 
"But you dont want these holes in the papers."
 
"Them s handy for siftin on t out," said Dinah.
 
"But you see it spills all over the drawer."
 
"Laws, yes! if Missis will go a tumblin things all up so, it will.
Missis has spilt lots dat ar way," said Dinah, coming uneasily to the
drawers. "If Missis only will go up stars till my clarin up time comes,
Ill have everything right but I cant do nothin when ladies is round,
a henderin. You, Sam, dont you gib the baby dat ar sugarbowl! Ill
crack ye over, if ye dont mind!"
 
"Im going through the kitchen, and going to put everything in order,
_once_, Dinah and then Ill expect you to _keep_ it so."
 
"Lor, now! Miss Phelia dat ar ant no way for ladies to do. I never did
see ladies doin no sich my old Missis nor Miss Marie never did, and
I dont see no kinder need on t" and Dinah stalked indignantly about,
while Miss Ophelia piled and sorted dishes, emptied dozens of scattering
bowls of sugar into one receptacle, sorted napkins, tablecloths, and
towels, for washing washing, wiping, and arranging with her own hands,
and with a speed and alacrity which perfectly amazed Dinah.
 
"Lor now! if dat ar de way dem northern ladies do, dey ant ladies,
nohow," she said to some of her satellites, when at a safe hearing
distance. "I has things as straight as anybody, when my clarin up times
comes but I dont want ladies round, a henderin, and getting my things
all where I cant find em."
 
To do Dinah justice, she had, at irregular periods, paroxyms of
reformation and arrangement, which she called "clarin up times," when
she would begin with great zeal, and turn every drawer and closet wrong
side outward, on to the floor or tables, and make the ordinary confusion
sevenfold more confounded. Then she would light her pipe, and leisurely
go over her arrangements, looking things over, and discoursing upon
them making all the young fry scour most vigorously on the tin things,
and keeping up for several hours a most energetic state of confusion,
which she would explain to the satisfaction of all inquirers, by the
remark that she was a "clarin up." "She couldnt hev things a gwine on
so as they had been, and she was gwine to make these yer young ones keep
better order" for Dinah herself, somehow, indulged the illusion that
she, herself, was the soul of order, and it was only the _young uns_,
and the everybody else in the house, that were the cause of anything
that fell short of perfection in this respect. When all the tins were
scoured, and the tables scrubbed snowy white, and everything that could
offend tucked out of sight in holes and corners, Dinah would dress
herself up in a smart dress, clean apron, and high, brilliant Madras
turban, and tell all marauding "young uns" to keep out of the kitchen,
for she was gwine to have things kept nice. Indeed, these periodic
seasons were often an inconvenience to the whole household for Dinah
would contract such an immoderate attachment to her scoured tin, as
to insist upon it that it shouldnt be used again for any possible
purpose,at least, till the ardor of the "clarin up" period abated.
 
Miss Ophelia, in a few days, thoroughly reformed every department of the
house to a systematic pattern but her labors in all departments that
depended on the cooperation of servants were like those of Sisyphus or
the Danaides. In despair, she one day appealed to St. Clare.
 
"There is no such thing as getting anything like a system in this
family!"
 
"To be sure, there isnt," said St. Clare.
 
"Such shiftless management, such waste, such confusion, I never saw!"
 
"I dare say you didnt."
 
"You would not take it so coolly, if you were housekeeper."
 
"My dear cousin, you may as well understand, once for all, that we
masters are divided into two classes, oppressors and oppressed. We who
are goodnatured and hate severity make up our minds to a good deal of
inconvenience. If we _will keep_ a shambling, loose, untaught set in the
community, for our convenience, why, we must take the consequence. Some
rare cases I have seen, of persons, who, by a peculiar tact, can produce
order and system without severity but Im not one of them,and so I
made up my mind, long ago, to let things go just as they do. I will not
have the poor devils thrashed and cut to pieces, and they know it,and,
of course, they know the staff is in their own hands."
 
"But to have no time, no place, no order,all going on in this
shiftless way!"
 
"My dear Vermont, you natives up by the North Pole set an extravagant
value on time! What on earth is the use of time to a fellow who has
twice as much of it as he knows what to do with? As to order and system,
where there is nothing to be done but to lounge on the sofa and read, an
hour sooner or later in breakfast or dinner isnt of much account. Now,
theres Dinah gets you a capital dinner,soup, ragout, roast fowl,
dessert, icecreams and all,and she creates it all out of chaos and
old night down there, in that kitchen. I think it really sublime, the
way she manages. But, Heaven bless us! if we are to go down there, and
view all the smoking and squatting about, and hurryscurryation of the
preparatory process, we should never eat more! My good cousin, absolve
yourself from that! Its more than a Catholic penance, and does no more
good. Youll only lose your own temper, and utterly confound Dinah. Let
her go her own way."
 
"But, Augustine, you dont know how I found things."
 
"Dont I? Dont I know that the rollingpin is under her bed, and the
nutmeggrater in her pocket with her tobacco,that there are sixtyfive
different sugarbowls, one in every hole in the house,that she washes
dishes with a dinnernapkin one day, and with a fragment of an old
petticoat the next? But the upshot is, she gets up glorious dinners,
makes superb coffee and you must judge her as warriors and statesmen
are judged, _by her success_."
 
"But the waste,the expense!"
 
"O, well! Lock everything you can, and keep the key. Give out by
driblets, and never inquire for odds and ends,it isnt best."
 
"That troubles me, Augustine. I cant help feeling as if these servants
were not _strictly honest_. Are you sure they can be relied on?"
 
Augustine laughed immoderately at the grave and anxious face with which
Miss Ophelia propounded the question.
 
"O, cousin, thats too good,_honest!_as if thats a thing to be
expected! Honest!why, of course, they arnt. Why should they be? What
upon earth is to make them so?"
 
"Why dont you instruct?"
 
"Instruct! O, fiddlestick! What instructing do you think I should do?
I look like it! As to Marie, she has spirit enough, to be sure, to kill
off a whole plantation, if Id let her manage but she wouldnt get the
cheatery out of them."
 
"Are there no honest ones?"
 
"Well, now and then one, whom Nature makes so impracticably simple,
truthful and faithful, that the worst possible influence cant destroy
it. But, you see, from the mothers breast the colored child feels and
sees that there are none but underhand ways open to it. It can get along
no other way with its parents, its mistress, its young master and missie
playfellows. Cunning and deception become necessary, inevitable
habits. It isnt fair to expect anything else of him. He ought not to
be punished for it. As to honesty, the slave is kept in that dependent,
semichildish state, that there is no making him realize the rights of
property, or feel that his masters goods are not his own, if he can get
them. For my part, I dont see how they _can_ be honest. Such a fellow
as Tom, here, is,is a moral miracle!"
 
"And what becomes of their souls?" said Miss Ophelia.
 
"That isnt my affair, as I know of," said St. Clare "I am only dealing
in facts of the present life. The fact is, that the whole race are
pretty generally understood to be turned over to the devil, for our
benefit, in this world, however it may turn out in another!"
 
"This is perfectly horrible!" said Miss Ophelia "you ought to be ashamed
of yourselves!"
 
"I dont know as I am. We are in pretty good company, for all that,"
said St. Clare, "as people in the broad road generally are. Look at
the high and the low, all the world over, and its the same story,the
lower class used up, body, soul and spirit, for the good of the upper.
It is so in England it is so everywhere and yet all Christendom stands
aghast, with virtuous indignation, because we do the thing in a little
different shape from what they do it."
 
"It isnt so in Vermont."
 
"Ah, well, in New England, and in the free States, you have the better
of us, I grant. But theres the bell so, Cousin, let us for a while lay
aside our sectional prejudices, and come out to dinner."
 
As Miss Ophelia was in the kitchen in the latter part of the afternoon,
some of the sable children called out, "La, sakes! thars Prue a coming,
grunting along like she allers does."
 
A tall, bony colored woman now entered the kitchen, bearing on her head
a basket of rusks and hot rolls.
 
"Ho, Prue! youve come," said Dinah.
 
Prue had a peculiar scowling expression of countenance, and a sullen,
grumbling voice. She set down her basket, squatted herself down, and
resting her elbows on her knees said,
 
"O Lord! I wisht I s dead!"
 
"Why do you wish you were dead?" said Miss Ophelia.
 
"Id be out o my misery," said the woman, gruffly, without taking her
eyes from the floor.
 
"What need you getting drunk, then, and cutting up, Prue?" said a spruce
quadroon chambermaid, dangling, as she spoke, a pair of coral eardrops.
 
The woman looked at her with a sour surly glance.
 
"Maybe youll come to it, one of these yer days. Id be glad to see you,
I would then youll be glad of a drop, like me, to forget your misery."
 
"Come, Prue," said Dinah, "lets look at your rusks. Heres Missis will
pay for them."
 
Miss Ophelia took out a couple of dozen.
 
"Thars some tickets in that ar old cracked jug on the top shelf," said
Dinah. "You, Jake, climb up and get it down."
 
"Tickets,what are they for?" said Miss Ophelia.
 
"We buy tickets of her Masr, and she gives us bread for em."
 
"And they counts my money and tickets, when I gets home, to see if I s
got the change and if I hant, they half kills me."
 
"And serves you right," said Jane, the pert chambermaid, "if you will
take their money to get drunk on. Thats what she does, Missis."
 
"And thats what I _will_ do,I cant live no other ways,drink and
forget my misery."
 
"You are very wicked and very foolish," said Miss Ophelia, "to steal
your masters money to make yourself a brute with."
 
"Its mighty likely, Missis but I will do it,yes, I will. O Lord!
I wish I s dead, I do,I wish I s dead, and out of my misery!" and
slowly and stiffly the old creature rose, and got her basket on her head
again but before she went out, she looked at the quadroon girt, who
still stood playing with her eardrops.
 
"Ye think yere mighty fine with them ar, a frolickin and a tossin
your head, and a lookin down on everybody. Well, never mind,you may
live to be a poor, old, cutup crittur, like me. Hope to the Lord ye
will, I do then see if ye wont drink,drink,drink,yerself into
torment and sarve ye right, toough!" and, with a malignant howl, the
woman left the room.
 
"Disgusting old beast!" said Adolph, who was getting his masters
shavingwater. "If I was her master, Id cut her up worse than she is."
 
"Ye couldnt do that ar, no ways," said Dinah. "Her backs a far sight
now,she cant never get a dress together over it."
 
"I think such low creatures ought not to be allowed to go round to
genteel families," said Miss Jane. "What do you think, Mr. St. Clare?"
she said, coquettishly tossing her head at Adolph.
 
It must be observed that, among other appropriations from his masters
stock, Adolph was in the habit of adopting his name and address and
that the style under which he moved, among the colored circles of New
Orleans, was that of _Mr. St. Clare_.
 
"Im certainly of your opinion, Miss Benoir," said Adolph.
 
Benoir was the name of Marie St. Clares family, and Jane was one of her
servants.
 
"Pray, Miss Benoir, may I be allowed to ask if those drops are for the
ball, tomorrow night? They are certainly bewitching!"
 
"I wonder, now, Mr. St. Clare, what the impudence of you men will come
to!" said Jane, tossing her pretty head til the eardrops twinkled
again. "I shant dance with you for a whole evening, if you go to asking
me any more questions."
 
"O, you couldnt be so cruel, now! I was just dying to know whether you
would appear in your pink tarletane," said Adolph.
 
"What is it?" said Rosa, a bright, piquant little quadroon who came
skipping down stairs at this moment.
 
"Why, Mr. St. Clares so impudent!"
 
"On my honor," said Adolph, "Ill leave it to Miss Rosa now."
 
"I know hes always a saucy creature," said Rosa, poising herself on
one of her little feet, and looking maliciously at Adolph. "Hes always
getting me so angry with him."
 
"O! ladies, ladies, you will certainly break my heart, between you,"
said Adolph. "I shall be found dead in my bed, some morning, and youll
have it to answer for."
 
"Do hear the horrid creature talk!" said both ladies, laughing
immoderately.
 
"Come,clar out, you! I cant have you cluttering up the kitchen," said
Dinah "in my way, foolin round here."
 
"Aunt Dinahs glum, because she cant go to the ball," said Rosa.
 
"Dont want none o your lightcolored balls," said Dinah "cuttin
round, makin blieve yous white folks. Arter all, yous niggers, much
as I am."
 
"Aunt Dinah greases her wool stiff, every day, to make it lie straight,"
said Jane.
 
"And it will be wool, after all," said Rosa, maliciously shaking down
her long, silky curls.
 
"Well, in the Lords sight, ant wool as good as har, any time?" said
Dinah. "Id like to have Missis say which is worth the most,a couple
such as you, or one like me. Get out wid ye, ye trumpery,I wont have
ye round!"
 
Here the conversation was interrupted in a twofold manner. St. Clares
voice was heard at the head of the stairs, asking Adolph if he meant to
stay all night with his shavingwater and Miss Ophelia, coming out of
the diningroom, said,
 
"Jane and Rosa, what are you wasting your time for, here? Go in and
attend to your muslins."
 
Our friend Tom, who had been in the kitchen during the conversation with
the old ruskwoman, had followed her out into the street. He saw her go
on, giving every once in a while a suppressed groan. At last she set
her basket down on a doorstep, and began arranging the old, faded shawl
which covered her shoulders.
 
"Ill carry your basket a piece," said Tom, compassionately.
 
"Why should ye?" said the woman. "I dont want no help."
 
"You seem to be sick, or in trouble, or somethin," said Tom.
 
"I ant sick," said the woman, shortly.
 
"I wish," said Tom, looking at her earnestly,"I wish I could persuade
you to leave off drinking. Dont you know it will be the ruin of ye,
body and soul?"
 
"I knows Im gwine to torment," said the woman, sullenly. "Ye dont
need to tell me that ar. I s ugly, I s wicked,I s gwine straight to
torment. O, Lord! I wish I s thar!"
 
Tom shuddered at these frightful words, spoken with a sullen,
impassioned earnestness.
 
"O, Lord have mercy on ye! poor crittur. Hant ye never heard of Jesus
Christ?"
 
"Jesus Christ,whos he?"
 
"Why, hes _the Lord_," said Tom.
 
"I think Ive hearn tell o the Lord, and the judgment and torment. Ive
heard o that."
 
"But didnt anybody ever tell you of the Lord Jesus, that loved us poor
sinners, and died for us?"
 
"Dont know nothin bout that," said the woman "nobody hant never
loved me, since my old man died."
 
"Where was you raised?" said Tom.
 
"Up in Kentuck. A man kept me to breed chilen for market, and sold em
as fast as they got big enough last of all, he sold me to a speculator,
and my Masr got me o him."
 
"What set you into this bad way of drinkin?"
 
"To get shet o my misery. I had one child after I come here and I
thought then Id have one to raise, cause Masr wasnt a speculator. It
was de peartest little thing! and Missis she seemed to think a heap on
t, at first it never cried,it was likely and fat. But Missis tuck
sick, and I tended her and I tuck the fever, and my milk all left me,
and the child it pined to skin and bone, and Missis wouldnt buy milk
for it. She wouldnt hear to me, when I telled her I hadnt milk. She
said she knowed I could feed it on what other folks eat and the child
kinder pined, and cried, and cried, and cried, day and night, and got
all gone to skin and bones, and Missis got sot agin it and she said t
want nothin but crossness. She wished it was dead, she said and she
wouldnt let me have it o nights, cause, she said, it kept me awake,
and made me good for nothing. She made me sleep in her room and I had
to put it away off in a little kind o garret, and thar it cried itself
to death, one night. It did and I tuck to drinkin, to keep its crying
out of my ears! I did,and I will drink! I will, if I do go to torment
for it! Masr says I shall go to torment, and I tell him Ive got thar
now!"
 
"O, ye poor crittur!" said Tom, "hant nobody never telled ye how the
Lord Jesus loved ye, and died for ye? Hant they telled ye that hell
help ye, and ye can go to heaven, and have rest, at last?"
 
"I looks like gwine to heaven," said the woman "ant thar where white
folks is gwine? Spose theyd have me thar? Id rather go to torment,
and get away from Masr and Missis. I had _so_," she said, as with her
usual groan, she got her basket on her head, and walked sullenly away.
 
Tom turned, and walked sorrowfully back to the house. In the court he
met little Eva,a crown of tuberoses on her head, and her eyes radiant
with delight.
 
"O, Tom! here you are. Im glad Ive found you. Papa says you may
get out the ponies, and take me in my little new carriage," she said,
catching his hand. "But whats the matter Tom?you look sober."
 
"I feel bad, Miss Eva," said Tom, sorrowfully. "But Ill get the horses
for you."
 
"But do tell me, Tom, what is the matter. I saw you talking to cross old
Prue."
 
Tom, in simple, earnest phrase, told Eva the womans history. She did
not exclaim or wonder, or weep, as other children do. Her cheeks grew
pale, and a deep, earnest shadow passed over her eyes. She laid both
hands on her bosom, and sighed heavily.

CHAPTER XIX
 
Miss Ophelias Experiences and Opinions Continued
 
 
"Tom, you neednt get me the horses. I dont want to go," she said.
 
"Why not, Miss Eva?"
 
"These things sink into my heart, Tom," said Eva,"they sink into my
heart," she repeated, earnestly. "I dont want to go" and she turned
from Tom, and went into the house.
 
A few days after, another woman came, in old Prues place, to bring the
rusks Miss Ophelia was in the kitchen.
 
"Lor!" said Dinah, "whats got Prue?"
 
"Prue isnt coming any more," said the woman, mysteriously.
 
"Why not?" said Dinah, "she ant dead, is she?"
 
"We doesnt exactly know. Shes down cellar," said the woman, glancing
at Miss Ophelia.
 
After Miss Ophelia had taken the rusks, Dinah followed the woman to the
door.
 
"What _has_ got Prue, any how?" she said.
 
The woman seemed desirous, yet reluctant, to speak, and answered, in
low, mysterious tone.
 
"Well, you mustnt tell nobody, Prue, she got drunk agin,and they
had her down cellar,and thar they left her all day,and I hearn em
saying that the _flies had got to her_,and _shes dead_!"
 
Dinah held up her hands, and, turning, saw close by her side the
spiritlike form of Evangeline, her large, mystic eyes dilated with
horror, and every drop of blood driven from her lips and cheeks.
 
"Lor bless us! Miss Evas gwine to faint away! What go us all, to let
her har such talk? Her pall be rail mad."
 
"I shant faint, Dinah," said the child, firmly "and why shouldnt I
hear it? It ant so much for me to hear it, as for poor Prue to suffer
it."
 
"_Lor sakes_! it isnt for sweet, delicate young ladies, like
you,these yer stories isnt its enough to kill em!"
 
Eva sighed again, and walked up stairs with a slow and melancholy step.
 
Miss Ophelia anxiously inquired the womans story. Dinah gave a very
garrulous version of it, to which Tom added the particulars which he had
drawn from her that morning.
 
"An abominable business,perfectly horrible!" she exclaimed, as she
entered the room where St. Clare lay reading his paper.
 
"Pray, what iniquity has turned up now?" said he.
 
"What now? why, those folks have whipped Prue to death!" said Miss
Ophelia, going on, with great strength of detail, into the story, and
enlarging on its most shocking particulars.
 
"I thought it would come to that, some time," said St. Clare, going on
with his paper.
 
"Thought so!ant you going to _do_ anything about it?" said Miss
Ophelia. "Havent you got any _selectmen_, or anybody, to interfere and
look after such matters?"
 
"Its commonly supposed that the _property_ interest is a sufficient
guard in these cases. If people choose to ruin their own possessions, I
dont know whats to be done. It seems the poor creature was a thief and
a drunkard and so there wont be much hope to get up sympathy for her."
 
"It is perfectly outrageous,it is horrid, Augustine! It will certainly
bring down vengeance upon you."
 
"My dear cousin, I didnt do it, and I cant help it I would, if I
could. If lowminded, brutal people will act like themselves, what am I
to do? they have absolute control they are irresponsible despots. There
would be no use in interfering there is no law that amounts to anything
practically, for such a case. The best we can do is to shut our eyes and
ears, and let it alone. Its the only resource left us."
 
"How can you shut your eyes and ears? How can you let such things
alone?"
 
"My dear child, what do you expect? Here is a whole class,debased,
uneducated, indolent, provoking,put, without any sort of terms or
conditions, entirely into the hands of such people as the majority in
our world are people who have neither consideration nor selfcontrol,
who havent even an enlightened regard to their own interest,for
thats the case with the largest half of mankind. Of course, in a
community so organized, what can a man of honorable and humane feelings
do, but shut his eyes all he can, and harden his heart? I cant buy
every poor wretch I see. I cant turn knighterrant, and undertake to
redress every individual case of wrong in such a city as this. The most
I can do is to try and keep out of the way of it."
 
St. Clares fine countenance was for a moment overcast he said,
 
"Come, cousin, dont stand there looking like one of the Fates youve
only seen a peep through the curtain,a specimen of what is going
on, the world over, in some shape or other. If we are to be prying
and spying into all the dismals of life, we should have no heart to
anything. T is like looking too close into the details of Dinahs
kitchen" and St. Clare lay back on the sofa, and busied himself with
his paper.
 
Miss Ophelia sat down, and pulled out her knittingwork, and sat there
grim with indignation. She knit and knit, but while she mused the fire
burned at last she broke out"I tell you, Augustine, I cant get over
things so, if you can. Its a perfect abomination for you to defend such
a system,thats _my_ mind!"
 
"What now?" said St. Clare, looking up. "At it again, hey?"
 
"I say its perfectly abominable for you to defend such a system!" said
Miss Ophelia, with increasing warmth.
 
"_I_ defend it, my dear lady? Who ever said I did defend it?" said St.
Clare.
 
"Of course, you defend it,you all do,all you Southerners. What do
you have slaves for, if you dont?"
 
"Are you such a sweet innocent as to suppose nobody in this world ever
does what they dont think is right? Dont you, or didnt you ever, do
anything that you did not think quite right?"
 
"If I do, I repent of it, I hope," said Miss Ophelia, rattling her
needles with energy.
 
"So do I," said St. Clare, peeling his orange "Im repenting of it all
the time."
 
"What do you keep on doing it for?"
 
"Didnt you ever keep on doing wrong, after youd repented, my good
cousin?"
 
"Well, only when Ive been very much tempted," said Miss Ophelia.
 
"Well, Im very much tempted," said St. Clare "thats just my
difficulty."
 
"But I always resolve I wont and I try to break off."
 
"Well, I have been resolving I wont, off and on, these ten years," said
St. Clare "but I havent, some how, got clear. Have you got clear of
all your sins, cousin?"
 
"Cousin Augustine," said Miss Ophelia, seriously, and laying down
her knittingwork, "I suppose I deserve that you should reprove my
shortcomings. I know all you say is true enough nobody else feels
them more than I do but it does seem to me, after all, there is some
difference between me and you. It seems to me I would cut off my right
hand sooner than keep on, from day to day, doing what I thought was
wrong. But, then, my conduct is so inconsistent with my profession, I
dont wonder you reprove me."
 
"O, now, cousin," said Augustine, sitting down on the floor, and laying
his head back in her lap, "dont take on so awfully serious! You know
what a goodfornothing, saucy boy I always was. I love to poke you
up,thats all,just to see you get earnest. I do think you are
desperately, distressingly good it tires me to death to think of it."
 
"But this is a serious subject, my boy, Auguste," said Miss Ophelia,
laying her hand on his forehead.
 
"Dismally so," said he "and Iwell, I never want to talk seriously in
hot weather. What with mosquitos and all, a fellow cant get himself
up to any very sublime moral flights and I believe," said St. Clare,
suddenly rousing himself up, "theres a theory, now! I understand now
why northern nations are always more virtuous than southern ones,I see
into that whole subject."
 
"O, Augustine, you are a sad rattlebrain!"
 
"Am I? Well, so I am, I suppose but for once I will be serious, now
but you must hand me that basket of orangesyou see, youll have to
stay me with flagons and comfort me with apples, if Im going to make
this effort. Now," said Augustine, drawing the basket up, "Ill begin
When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a fellow
to hold two or three dozen of his fellowworms in captivity, a decent
regard to the opinions of society requires"
 
"I dont see that you are growing more serious," said Miss Ophelia.
 
"Wait,Im coming on,youll hear. The short of the matter is,
cousin," said he, his handsome face suddenly settling into an earnest
and serious expression, "on this abstract question of slavery there
can, as I think, be but one opinion. Planters, who have money to make by
it,clergymen, who have planters to please,politicians, who want
to rule by it,may warp and bend language and ethics to a degree that
shall astonish the world at their ingenuity they can press nature and
the Bible, and nobody knows what else, into the service but, after all,
neither they nor the world believe in it one particle the more. It comes
from the devil, thats the short of itand, to my mind, its a pretty
respectable specimen of what he can do in his own line."
 
Miss Ophelia stopped her knitting, and looked surprised, and St. Clare,
apparently enjoying her astonishment, went on.
 
"You seem to wonder but if you will get me fairly at it, Ill make a
clean breast of it. This cursed business, accursed of God and man, what
is it? Strip it of all its ornament, run it down to the root and nucleus
of the whole, and what is it? Why, because my brother Quashy is ignorant
and weak, and I am intelligent and strong,because I know how, and
_can_ do it,therefore, I may steal all he has, keep it, and give
him only such and so much as suits my fancy. Whatever is too hard, too
dirty, too disagreeable, for me, I may set Quashy to doing. Because I
dont like work, Quashy shall work. Because the sun burns me, Quashy
shall stay in the sun. Quashy shall earn the money, and I will spend it.
Quashy shall lie down in every puddle, that I may walk over dryshod.
Quashy shall do my will, and not his, all the days of his mortal
life, and have such chance of getting to heaven, at last, as I find
convenient. This I take to be about what slavery _is_. I defy anybody
on earth to read our slavecode, as it stands in our lawbooks, and make
anything else of it. Talk of the _abuses_ of slavery! Humbug! The _thing
itself_ is the essence of all abuse! And the only reason why the land
dont sink under it, like Sodom and Gomorrah, is because it is _used_ in
a way infinitely better than it is. For pitys sake, for shames sake,
because we are men born of women, and not savage beasts, many of us do
not, and dare not,we would _scorn_ to use the full power which our
savage laws put into our hands. And he who goes the furthest, and does
the worst, only uses within limits the power that the law gives him."
 
St. Clare had started up, and, as his manner was when excited, was
walking, with hurried steps, up and down the floor. His fine face,
classic as that of a Greek statue, seemed actually to burn with the
fervor of his feelings. His large blue eyes flashed, and he gestured
with an unconscious eagerness. Miss Ophelia had never seen him in this
mood before, and she sat perfectly silent.
 
"I declare to you," said he, suddenly stopping before his cousin "Its
no sort of use to talk or to feel on this subject, but I declare to
you, there have been times when I have thought, if the whole country
would sink, and hide all this injustice and misery from the light, I
would willingly sink with it. When I have been travelling up and down
on our boats, or about on my collecting tours, and reflected that every
brutal, disgusting, mean, lowlived fellow I met, was allowed by our
laws to become absolute despot of as many men, women and children, as
he could cheat, steal, or gamble money enough to buy,when I have seen
such men in actual ownership of helpless children, of young girls and
women,I have been ready to curse my country, to curse the human race!"
 
"Augustine! Augustine!" said Miss Ophelia, "Im sure youve said enough.
I never, in my life, heard anything like this, even at the North."
 
"At the North!" said St. Clare, with a sudden change of expression, and
resuming something of his habitual careless tone. "Pooh! your northern
folks are coldblooded you are cool in everything! You cant begin to
curse up hill and down as we can, when we get fairly at it."
 
"Well, but the question is," said Miss Ophelia.
 
"O, yes, to be sure, the _question is_,and a deuce of a question it
is! How came _you_ in this state of sin and misery? Well, I shall
answer in the good old words you used to teach me, Sundays. I came so by
ordinary generation. My servants were my fathers, and, what is more,
my mothers and now they are mine, they and their increase, which bids
fair to be a pretty considerable item. My father, you know, came first
from New England and he was just such another man as your father,a
regular old Roman,upright, energetic, nobleminded, with an iron will.
Your father settled down in New England, to rule over rocks and stones,
and to force an existence out of Nature and mine settled in Louisiana,
to rule over men and women, and force existence out of them. My mother,"
said St. Clare, getting up and walking to a picture at the end of the
room, and gazing upward with a face fervent with veneration, "_she was
divine!_ Dont look at me so!you know what I mean! She probably was of
mortal birth but, as far as ever I could observe, there was no trace
of any human weakness or error about her and everybody that lives to
remember her, whether bond or free, servant, acquaintance, relation,
all say the same. Why, cousin, that mother has been all that has stood
between me and utter unbelief for years. She was a direct embodiment and
personification of the New Testament,a living fact, to be accounted
for, and to be accounted for in no other way than by its truth. O,
mother! mother!" said St. Clare, clasping his hands, in a sort of
transport and then suddenly checking himself, he came back, and seating
himself on an ottoman, he went on
 
"My brother and I were twins and they say, you know, that twins ought
to resemble each other but we were in all points a contrast. He had
black, fiery eyes, coalblack hair, a strong, fine Roman profile, and
a rich brown complexion. I had blue eyes, golden hair, a Greek outline,
and fair complexion. He was active and observing, I dreamy and inactive.
He was generous to his friends and equals, but proud, dominant,
overbearing, to inferiors, and utterly unmerciful to whatever set itself
up against him. Truthful we both were he from pride and courage, I from
a sort of abstract ideality. We loved each other about as boys generally
do,off and on, and in generalhe was my fathers pet, and I my
mothers.
 
"There was a morbid sensitiveness and acuteness of feeling in me on
all possible subjects, of which he and my father had no kind of
understanding, and with which they could have no possible sympathy. But
mother did and so, when I had quarreled with Alfred, and father looked
sternly on me, I used to go off to mothers room, and sit by her. I
remember just how she used to look, with her pale cheeks, her deep,
soft, serious eyes, her white dress,she always wore white and I used
to think of her whenever I read in Revelations about the saints that
were arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. She had a great deal of
genius of one sort and another, particularly in music and she used
to sit at her organ, playing fine old majestic music of the Catholic
church, and singing with a voice more like an angel than a mortal
woman and I would lay my head down on her lap, and cry, and dream, and
feel,oh, immeasurably!things that I had no language to say!
 
"In those days, this matter of slavery had never been canvassed as it
has now nobody dreamed of any harm in it.
 
"My father was a born aristocrat. I think, in some preexistent state, he
must have been in the higher circles of spirits, and brought all his old
court pride along with him for it was ingrain, bred in the bone, though
he was originally of poor and not in any way of noble family. My brother
was begotten in his image.
 
"Now, an aristocrat, you know, the world over, has no human sympathies,
beyond a certain line in society. In England the line is in one place,
in Burmah in another, and in America in another but the aristocrat
of all these countries never goes over it. What would be hardship and
distress and injustice in his own class, is a cool matter of course in
another one. My fathers dividing line was that of color. _Among his
equals_, never was a man more just and generous but he considered the
negro, through all possible gradations of color, as an intermediate
link between man and animals, and graded all his ideas of justice or
generosity on this hypothesis. I suppose, to be sure, if anybody had
asked him, plump and fair, whether they had human immortal souls, he
might have hemmed and hawed, and said yes. But my father was not a man
much troubled with spiritualism religious sentiment he had none, beyond
a veneration for God, as decidedly the head of the upper classes.
 
"Well, my father worked some five hundred negroes he was an inflexible,
driving, punctilious business man everything was to move by system,to
be sustained with unfailing accuracy and precision. Now, if you take
into account that all this was to be worked out by a set of lazy,
twaddling, shiftless laborers, who had grown up, all their lives, in
the absence of every possible motive to learn how to do anything
but shirk, as you Vermonters say, and youll see that there might
naturally be, on his plantation, a great many things that looked
horrible and distressing to a sensitive child, like me.
 
"Besides all, he had an overseer,great, tall, slabsided, twofisted
renegade son of Vermontbegging your pardon,who had gone through a
regular apprenticeship in hardness and brutality and taken his degree to
be admitted to practice. My mother never could endure him, nor I but
he obtained an entire ascendency over my father and this man was the
absolute despot of the estate.
 
"I was a little fellow then, but I had the same love that I have now for
all kinds of human things,a kind of passion for the study of humanity,
come in what shape it would. I was found in the cabins and among the
fieldhands a great deal, and, of course, was a great favorite and all
sorts of complaints and grievances were breathed in my ear and I told
them to mother, and we, between us, formed a sort of committee for
a redress of grievances. We hindered and repressed a great deal of
cruelty, and congratulated ourselves on doing a vast deal of good, till,
as often happens, my zeal overacted. Stubbs complained to my father that
he couldnt manage the hands, and must resign his position. Father was
a fond, indulgent husband, but a man that never flinched from anything
that he thought necessary and so he put down his foot, like a rock,
between us and the fieldhands. He told my mother, in language
perfectly respectful and deferential, but quite explicit, that over
the houseservants she should be entire mistress, but that with the
fieldhands he could allow no interference. He revered and respected her
above all living beings but he would have said it all the same to the
virgin Mary herself, if she had come in the way of his system.
 
"I used sometimes to hear my mother reasoning cases with
him,endeavoring to excite his sympathies. He would listen to the most
pathetic appeals with the most discouraging politeness and equanimity.
It all resolves itself into this, he would say must I part with
Stubbs, or keep him? Stubbs is the soul of punctuality, honesty, and
efficiency,a thorough business hand, and as humane as the general
run. We cant have perfection and if I keep him, I must sustain his
administration as a _whole_, even if there are, now and then, things
that are exceptionable. All government includes some necessary hardness.
General rules will bear hard on particular cases. This last maxim my
father seemed to consider a settler in most alleged cases of cruelty.
After he had said _that_, he commonly drew up his feet on the sofa, like
a man that has disposed of a business, and betook himself to a nap, or
the newspaper, as the case might be.
 
"The fact is my father showed the exact sort of talent for a statesman.
He could have divided Poland as easily as an orange, or trod on Ireland
as quietly and systematically as any man living. At last my mother gave
up, in despair. It never will be known, till the last account, what
noble and sensitive natures like hers have felt, cast, utterly helpless,
into what seems to them an abyss of injustice and cruelty, and which
seems so to nobody about them. It has been an age of long sorrow of such
natures, in such a hellbegotten sort of world as ours. What remained
for her, but to train her children in her own views and sentiments?
Well, after all you say about training, children will grow up
substantially what they _are_ by nature, and only that. From the cradle,
Alfred was an aristocrat and as he grew up, instinctively, all his
sympathies and all his reasonings were in that line, and all mothers
exhortations went to the winds. As to me, they sunk deep into me. She
never contradicted, in form, anything my father said, or seemed directly
to differ from him but she impressed, burnt into my very soul, with all
the force of her deep, earnest nature, an idea of the dignity and worth
of the meanest human soul. I have looked in her face with solemn awe,
when she would point up to the stars in the evening, and say to me, See
there, Auguste! the poorest, meanest soul on our place will be living,
when all these stars are gone forever,will live as long as God lives!
 
"She had some fine old paintings one, in particular, of Jesus healing
a blind man. They were very fine, and used to impress me strongly. See
there, Auguste, she would say the blind man was a beggar, poor and
loathsome therefore, he would not heal him _afar off!_ He called him to
him, and put _his hands on him!_ Remember this, my boy. If I had lived
to grow up under her care, she might have stimulated me to I know not
what of enthusiasm. I might have been a saint, reformer, martyr,but,
alas! alas! I went from her when I was only thirteen, and I never saw
her again!"
 
St. Clare rested his head on his hands, and did not speak for some
minutes. After a while, he looked up, and went on
 
"What poor, mean trash this whole business of human virtue is! A mere
matter, for the most part, of latitude and longitude, and geographical
position, acting with natural temperament. The greater part is nothing
but an accident! Your father, for example, settles in Vermont, in a town
where all are, in fact, free and equal becomes a regular church member
and deacon, and in due time joins an Abolition society, and thinks
us all little better than heathens. Yet he is, for all the world, in
constitution and habit, a duplicate of my father. I can see it leaking
out in fifty different ways,just the same strong, overbearing,
dominant spirit. You know very well how impossible it is to persuade
some of the folks in your village that Squire Sinclair does not feel
above them. The fact is, though he has fallen on democratic times, and
embraced a democratic theory, he is to the heart an aristocrat, as much
as my father, who ruled over five or six hundred slaves."
 
Miss Ophelia felt rather disposed to cavil at this picture, and was
laying down her knitting to begin, but St. Clare stopped her.
 
"Now, I know every word you are going to say. I do not say they _were_
alike, in fact. One fell into a condition where everything acted against
the natural tendency, and the other where everything acted for it and
so one turned out a pretty wilful, stout, overbearing old democrat, and
the other a wilful, stout old despot. If both had owned plantations in
Louisiana, they would have been as like as two old bullets cast in the
same mould."
 
"What an undutiful boy you are!" said Miss Ophelia.
 
"I dont mean them any disrespect," said St. Clare. "You know reverence
is not my forte. But, to go back to my history
 
"When father died, he left the whole property to us twin boys, to be
divided as we should agree. There does not breathe on Gods earth a
noblersouled, more generous fellow, than Alfred, in all that concerns
his equals and we got on admirably with this property question,
without a single unbrotherly word or feeling. We undertook to work the
plantation together and Alfred, whose outward life and capabilities
had double the strength of mine, became an enthusiastic planter, and a
wonderfully successful one.
 
"But two years trial satisfied me that I could not be a partner in that
matter. To have a great gang of seven hundred, whom I could not know
personally, or feel any individual interest in, bought and driven,
housed, fed, worked like so many horned cattle, strained up to military
precision,the question of how little of lifes commonest enjoyments
would keep them in working order being a constantly recurring
problem,the necessity of drivers and overseers,the evernecessary
whip, first, last, and only argument,the whole thing was insufferably
disgusting and loathsome to me and when I thought of my mothers
estimate of one poor human soul, it became even frightful!
 
"Its all nonsense to talk to me about slaves _enjoying_ all this! To
this day, I have no patience with the unutterable trash that some of
your patronizing Northerners have made up, as in their zeal to apologize
for our sins. We all know better. Tell me that any man living wants to
work all his days, from daydawn till dark, under the constant eye of a
master, without the power of putting forth one irresponsible volition,
on the same dreary, monotonous, unchanging toil, and all for two pairs
of pantaloons and a pair of shoes a year, with enough food and shelter
to keep him in working order! Any man who thinks that human beings can,
as a general thing, be made about as comfortable that way as any other,
I wish he might try it. Id buy the dog, and work him, with a clear
conscience!"
 
"I always have supposed," said Miss Ophelia, "that you, all of you,
approved of these things, and thought them _right_according to
Scripture."
 
"Humbug! We are not quite reduced to that yet. Alfred who is as
determined a despot as ever walked, does not pretend to this kind of
defenceno, he stands, high and haughty, on that good old respectable
ground, _the right of the strongest_ and he says, and I think quite
sensibly, that the American planter is only doing, in another form,
what the English aristocracy and capitalists are doing by the lower
classes that is, I take it, _appropriating_ them, body and bone, soul
and spirit, to their use and convenience. He defends both,and I think,
at least, _consistently_. He says that there can be no high civilization
without enslavement of the masses, either nominal or real. There must,
he says, be a lower class, given up to physical toil and confined to an
animal nature and a higher one thereby acquires leisure and wealth for
a more expanded intelligence and improvement, and becomes the directing
soul of the lower. So he reasons, because, as I said, he is born an
aristocratso I dont believe, because I was born a democrat."
 
"How in the world can the two things be compared?" said Miss Ophelia.
"The English laborer is not sold, traded, parted from his family,
whipped."
 
"He is as much at the will of his employer as if he were sold to him.
The slaveowner can whip his refractory slave to death,the capitalist
can starve him to death. As to family security, it is hard to say which
is the worst,to have ones children sold, or see them starve to death
at home."
 
"But its no kind of apology for slavery, to prove that it isnt worse
than some other bad thing."
 
"I didnt give it for one,nay, Ill say, besides, that ours is the
more bold and palpable infringement of human rights actually buying a
man up, like a horse,looking at his teeth, cracking his joints, and
trying his paces and then paying down for him,having speculators,
breeders, traders, and brokers in human bodies and souls,sets the
thing before the eyes of the civilized world in a more tangible form,
though the thing done be, after all, in its nature, the same that is,
appropriating one set of human beings to the use and improvement of
another without any regard to their own."
 
"I never thought of the matter in this light," said Miss Ophelia.
 
"Well, Ive travelled in England some, and Ive looked over a good many
documents as to the state of their lower classes and I really think
there is no denying Alfred, when he says that his slaves are better off
than a large class of the population of England. You see, you must not
infer, from what I have told you, that Alfred is what is called a hard
master for he isnt. He is despotic, and unmerciful to insubordination
he would shoot a fellow down with as little remorse as he would shoot
a buck, if he opposed him. But, in general, he takes a sort of pride in
having his slaves comfortably fed and accommodated.
 
"When I was with him, I insisted that he should do something for their
instruction and, to please me, he did get a chaplain, and used to have
them catechized Sunday, though, I believe, in his heart, that he thought
it would do about as much good to set a chaplain over his dogs and
horses. And the fact is, that a mind stupefied and animalized by every
bad influence from the hour of birth, spending the whole of every
weekday in unreflecting toil, cannot be done much with by a few hours
on Sunday. The teachers of Sundayschools among the manufacturing
population of England, and among plantationhands in our country, could
perhaps testify to the same result, _there and here_. Yet some striking
exceptions there are among us, from the fact that the negro is naturally
more impressible to religious sentiment than the white."
 
"Well," said Miss Ophelia, "how came you to give up your plantation
life?"
 
"Well, we jogged on together some time, till Alfred saw plainly that
I was no planter. He thought it absurd, after he had reformed, and
altered, and improved everywhere, to suit my notions, that I still
remained unsatisfied. The fact was, it was, after all, the THING that
I hatedthe using these men and women, the perpetuation of all this
ignorance, brutality and vice,just to make money for me!
 
"Besides, I was always interfering in the details. Being myself one of
the laziest of mortals, I had altogether too much fellowfeeling for the
lazy and when poor, shiftless dogs put stones at the bottom of their
cottonbaskets to make them weigh heavier, or filled their sacks with
dirt, with cotton at the top, it seemed so exactly like what I should do
if I were they, I couldnt and wouldnt have them flogged for it. Well,
of course, there was an end of plantation discipline and Alf and I
came to about the same point that I and my respected father did, years
before. So he told me that I was a womanish sentimentalist, and would
never do for business life and advised me to take the bankstock and
the New Orleans family mansion, and go to writing poetry, and let him
manage the plantation. So we parted, and I came here."
 
"But why didnt you free your slaves?"
 
"Well, I wasnt up to that. To hold them as tools for moneymaking, I
could nothave them to help spend money, you know, didnt look quite
so ugly to me. Some of them were old houseservants, to whom I was much
attached and the younger ones were children to the old. All were well
satisfied to be as they were." He paused, and walked reflectively up and
down the room.
 
"There was," said St. Clare, "a time in my life when I had plans and
hopes of doing something in this world, more than to float and drift. I
had vague, indistinct yearnings to be a sort of emancipator,to free
my native land from this spot and stain. All young men have had such
feverfits, I suppose, some time,but then"
 
"Why didnt you?" said Miss Ophelia"you ought not to put your hand to
the plough, and look back."
 
"O, well, things didnt go with me as I expected, and I got the despair
of living that Solomon did. I suppose it was a necessary incident to
wisdom in us both but, some how or other, instead of being actor and
regenerator in society, I became a piece of driftwood, and have been
floating and eddying about, ever since. Alfred scolds me, every time
we meet and he has the better of me, I grant,for he really does
something his life is a logical result of his opinions and mine is a
contemptible _non sequitur_."
 
"My dear cousin, can you be satisfied with such a way of spending your
probation?"
 
"Satisfied! Was I not just telling you I despised it? But, then, to come
back to this point,we were on this liberation business. I dont think
my feelings about slavery are peculiar. I find many men who, in their
hearts, think of it just as I do. The land groans under it and, bad as
it is for the slave, it is worse, if anything, for the master. It
takes no spectacles to see that a great class of vicious, improvident,
degraded people, among us, are an evil to us, as well as to themselves.
The capitalist and aristocrat of England cannot feel that as we do,
because they do not mingle with the class they degrade as we do. They
are in our homes they are the associates of our children, and they form
their minds faster than we can for they are a race that children always
will cling to and assimilate with. If Eva, now, was not more angel than
ordinary, she would be ruined. We might as well allow the smallpox to
run among them, and think our children would not take it, as to let them
be uninstructed and vicious, and think our children will not be affected
by that. Yet our laws positively and utterly forbid any efficient
general educational system, and they do it wisely, too for, just begin
and thoroughly educate one generation, and the whole thing would be
blown sky high. If we did not give them liberty, they would take it."
 
"And what do you think will be the end of this?" said Miss Ophelia.
 
"I dont know. One thing is certain,that there is a mustering among
the masses, the world over and there is a _dies iræ_ coming on, sooner
or later. The same thing is working in Europe, in England, and in this
country. My mother used to tell me of a millennium that was coming,
when Christ should reign, and all men should be free and happy. And she
taught me, when I was a boy, to pray, thy kingdom come. Sometimes I
think all this sighing, and groaning, and stirring among the dry bones
foretells what she used to tell me was coming. But who may abide the day
of His appearing?"
 
"Augustine, sometimes I think you are not far from the kingdom," said
Miss Ophelia, laying down her knitting, and looking anxiously at her
cousin.
 
"Thank you for your good opinion, but its up and down with me,up to
heavens gate in theory, down in earths dust in practice. But theres
the teabell,do lets go,and dont say, now, I havent had one
downright serious talk, for once in my life."
 
At table, Marie alluded to the incident of Prue. "I suppose youll
think, cousin," she said, "that we are all barbarians."
 
"I think thats a barbarous thing," said Miss Ophelia, "but I dont
think you are all barbarians."
 
"Well, now," said Marie, "I know its impossible to get along with some
of these creatures. They are so bad they ought not to live. I dont feel
a particle of sympathy for such cases. If theyd only behave themselves,
it would not happen."
 
"But, mamma," said Eva, "the poor creature was unhappy thats what made
her drink."
 
"O, fiddlestick! as if that were any excuse! Im unhappy, very often. I
presume," she said, pensively, "that Ive had greater trials than ever
she had. Its just because they are so bad. Theres some of them that
you cannot break in by any kind of severity. I remember father had a
man that was so lazy he would run away just to get rid of work, and lie
round in the swamps, stealing and doing all sorts of horrid things. That
man was caught and whipped, time and again, and it never did him any
good and the last time he crawled off, though he couldnt but just go,
and died in the swamp. There was no sort of reason for it, for fathers
hands were always treated kindly."
 
"I broke a fellow in, once," said St. Clare, "that all the overseers and
masters had tried their hands on in vain."
 
"You!" said Marie "well, Id be glad to know when _you_ ever did
anything of the sort."
 
"Well, he was a powerful, gigantic fellow,a nativeborn African and
he appeared to have the rude instinct of freedom in him to an uncommon
degree. He was a regular African lion. They called him Scipio. Nobody
could do anything with him and he was sold round from overseer to
overseer, till at last Alfred bought him, because he thought he could
manage him. Well, one day he knocked down the overseer, and was fairly
off into the swamps. I was on a visit to Alfs plantation, for it was
after we had dissolved partnership. Alfred was greatly exasperated
but I told him that it was his own fault, and laid him any wager that I
could break the man and finally it was agreed that, if I caught him, I
should have him to experiment on. So they mustered out a party of some
six or seven, with guns and dogs, for the hunt. People, you know, can
get up as much enthusiasm in hunting a man as a deer, if it is only
customary in fact, I got a little excited myself, though I had only put
in as a sort of mediator, in case he was caught.
 
"Well, the dogs bayed and howled, and we rode and scampered, and finally
we started him. He ran and bounded like a buck, and kept us well in the
rear for some time but at last he got caught in an impenetrable thicket
of cane then he turned to bay, and I tell you he fought the dogs right
gallantly. He dashed them to right and left, and actually killed three
of them with only his naked fists, when a shot from a gun brought him
down, and he fell, wounded and bleeding, almost at my feet. The poor
fellow looked up at me with manhood and despair both in his eye. I kept
back the dogs and the party, as they came pressing up, and claimed him
as my prisoner. It was all I could do to keep them from shooting him, in
the flush of success but I persisted in my bargain, and Alfred sold him
to me. Well, I took him in hand, and in one fortnight I had him tamed
down as submissive and tractable as heart could desire."
 
"What in the world did you do to him?" said Marie.
 
"Well, it was quite a simple process. I took him to my own room, had a
good bed made for him, dressed his wounds, and tended him myself, until
he got fairly on his feet again. And, in process of time, I had free
papers made out for him, and told him he might go where he liked."
 
"And did he go?" said Miss Ophelia.
 
"No. The foolish fellow tore the paper in two, and absolutely refused
to leave me. I never had a braver, better fellow,trusty and true as
steel. He embraced Christianity afterwards, and became as gentle as a
child. He used to oversee my place on the lake, and did it capitally,
too. I lost him the first cholera season. In fact, he laid down his life
for me. For I was sick, almost to death and when, through the panic,
everybody else fled, Scipio worked for me like a giant, and actually
brought me back into life again. But, poor fellow! he was taken, right
after, and there was no saving him. I never felt anybodys loss more."
 
Eva had come gradually nearer and nearer to her father, as he told the
story,her small lips apart, her eyes wide and earnest with absorbing
interest.
 
As he finished, she suddenly threw her arms around his neck, burst into
tears, and sobbed convulsively.
 
"Eva, dear child! what is the matter?" said St. Clare, as the childs
small frame trembled and shook with the violence of her feelings. "This
child," he added, "ought not to hear any of this kind of thing,shes
nervous."
 
"No, papa, Im not nervous," said Eva, controlling herself, suddenly,
with a strength of resolution singular in such a child. "Im not
nervous, but these things _sink into my heart_."
 
"What do you mean, Eva?"
 
"I cant tell you, papa, I think a great many thoughts. Perhaps some day
I shall tell you."
 
"Well, think away, dear,only dont cry and worry your papa," said St.
Clare, "Look here,see what a beautiful peach I have got for you."
 
Eva took it and smiled, though there was still a nervous twiching about
the corners of her mouth.
 
"Come, look at the goldfish," said St. Clare, taking her hand and
stepping on to the verandah. A few moments, and merry laughs were heard
through the silken curtains, as Eva and St. Clare were pelting each
other with roses, and chasing each other among the alleys of the court.
 
 
There is danger that our humble friend Tom be neglected amid the
adventures of the higher born but, if our readers will accompany us up
to a little loft over the stable, they may, perhaps, learn a little
of his affairs. It was a decent room, containing a bed, a chair, and a
small, rough stand, where lay Toms Bible and hymnbook and where he
sits, at present, with his slate before him, intent on something that
seems to cost him a great deal of anxious thought.
 
The fact was, that Toms homeyearnings had become so strong that he had
begged a sheet of writingpaper of Eva, and, mustering up all his small
stock of literary attainment acquired by Masr Georges instructions, he
conceived the bold idea of writing a letter and he was busy now, on his
slate, getting out his first draft. Tom was in a good deal of trouble,
for the forms of some of the letters he had forgotten entirely and of
what he did remember, he did not know exactly which to use. And while he
was working, and breathing very hard, in his earnestness, Eva alighted,
like a bird, on the round of his chair behind him, and peeped over his
shoulder.
 
"O, Uncle Tom! what funny things you _are_ making, there!"
 
"Im trying to write to my poor old woman, Miss Eva, and my little
chilen," said Tom, drawing the back of his hand over his eyes "but,
some how, Im feard I shant make it out."
 
"I wish I could help you, Tom! Ive learnt to write some. Last year I
could make all the letters, but Im afraid Ive forgotten."
 
So Eva put her golden head close to his, and the two commenced a grave
and anxious discussion, each one equally earnest, and about equally
ignorant and, with a deal of consulting and advising over every word,
the composition began, as they both felt very sanguine, to look quite
like writing.
 
"Yes, Uncle Tom, it really begins to look beautiful," said Eva, gazing
delightedly on it. "How pleased your wifell be, and the poor little
children! O, its a shame you ever had to go away from them! I mean to
ask papa to let you go back, some time."
 
"Missis said that she would send down money for me, as soon as they
could get it together," said Tom. "Im spectin, she will. Young Masr
George, he said hed come for me and he gave me this yer dollar as a
sign" and Tom drew from under his clothes the precious dollar.
 
"O, hell certainly come, then!" said Eva. "Im so glad!"
 
"And I wanted to send a letter, you know, to let em know whar I was,
and tell poor Chloe that I was well off,cause she felt so drefful,
poor soul!"
 
"I say Tom!" said St. Clares voice, coming in the door at this moment.
 
Tom and Eva both started.
 
"Whats here?" said St. Clare, coming up and looking at the slate.
 
"O, its Toms letter. Im helping him to write it," said Eva "isnt it
nice?"
 
"I wouldnt discourage either of you," said St. Clare, "but I rather
think, Tom, youd better get me to write your letter for you. Ill do
it, when I come home from my ride."
 
"Its very important he should write," said Eva, "because his mistress
is going to send down money to redeem him, you know, papa he told me
they told him so."
 
St. Clare thought, in his heart, that this was probably only one
of those things which goodnatured owners say to their servants,
to alleviate their horror of being sold, without any intention of
fulfilling the expectation thus excited. But he did not make any audible
comment upon it,only ordered Tom to get the horses out for a ride.
 
Toms letter was written in due form for him that evening, and safely
lodged in the postoffice.
 
Miss Ophelia still persevered in her labors in the housekeeping line. It
was universally agreed, among all the household, from Dinah down to the
youngest urchin, that Miss Ophelia was decidedly "curis,"a term by
which a southern servant implies that his or her betters dont exactly
suit them.
 
The higher circle in the familyto wit, Adolph, Jane and Rosaagreed
that she was no lady ladies never keep working about as she did,that
she had no _air_ at all and they were surprised that she should be any
relation of the St. Clares. Even Marie declared that it was absolutely
fatiguing to see Cousin Ophelia always so busy. And, in fact, Miss
Ophelias industry was so incessant as to lay some foundation for the
complaint. She sewed and stitched away, from daylight till dark, with
the energy of one who is pressed on by some immediate urgency and then,
when the light faded, and the work was folded away, with one turn out
came the everready knittingwork, and there she was again, going on as
briskly as ever. It really was a labor to see her.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XX
 
Topsy
 
 
One morning, while Miss Ophelia was busy in some of her domestic cares,
St. Clares voice was heard, calling her at the foot of the stairs.
 
"Come down here, Cousin, Ive something to show you."
 
"What is it?" said Miss Ophelia, coming down, with her sewing in her
hand.
 
"Ive made a purchase for your department,see here," said St. Clare
and, with the word, he pulled along a little negro girl, about eight or
nine years of age.
 
She was one of the blackest of her race and her round shining eyes,
glittering as glass beads, moved with quick and restless glances over
everything in the room. Her mouth, half open with astonishment at the
wonders of the new Masrs parlor, displayed a white and brilliant set
of teeth. Her woolly hair was braided in sundry little tails, which
stuck out in every direction. The expression of her face was an odd
mixture of shrewdness and cunning, over which was oddly drawn, like a
kind of veil, an expression of the most doleful gravity and solemnity.
She was dressed in a single filthy, ragged garment, made of bagging and
stood with her hands demurely folded before her. Altogether, there was
something odd and goblinlike about her appearance,something, as Miss
Ophelia afterwards said, "so heathenish," as to inspire that good lady
with utter dismay and turning to St. Clare, she said,
 
"Augustine, what in the world have you brought that thing here for?"
 
"For you to educate, to be sure, and train in the way she should go.
I thought she was rather a funny specimen in the Jim Crow line. Here,
Topsy," he added, giving a whistle, as a man would to call the attention
of a dog, "give us a song, now, and show us some of your dancing."
 
The black, glassy eyes glittered with a kind of wicked drollery, and the
thing struck up, in a clear shrill voice, an odd negro melody, to which
she kept time with her hands and feet, spinning round, clapping her
hands, knocking her knees together, in a wild, fantastic sort of
time, and producing in her throat all those odd guttural sounds which
distinguish the native music of her race and finally, turning a
summerset or two, and giving a prolonged closing note, as odd and
unearthly as that of a steamwhistle, she came suddenly down on the
carpet, and stood with her hands folded, and a most sanctimonious
expression of meekness and solemnity over her face, only broken by the
cunning glances which she shot askance from the corners of her eyes.
 
Miss Ophelia stood silent, perfectly paralyzed with amazement. St.
Clare, like a mischievous fellow as he was, appeared to enjoy her
astonishment and, addressing the child again, said,
 
"Topsy, this is your new mistress. Im going to give you up to her see
now that you behave yourself."
 
"Yes, Masr," said Topsy, with sanctimonious gravity, her wicked eyes
twinkling as she spoke.
 
"Youre going to be good, Topsy, you understand," said St. Clare.
 
"O yes, Masr," said Topsy, with another twinkle, her hands still
devoutly folded.
 
"Now, Augustine, what upon earth is this for?" said Miss Ophelia. "Your
house is so full of these little plagues, now, that a body cant set
down their foot without treading on em. I get up in the morning, and
find one asleep behind the door, and see one black head poking out from
under the table, one lying on the doormat,and they are mopping and
mowing and grinning between all the railings, and tumbling over the
kitchen floor! What on earth did you want to bring this one for?"
 
"For you to educatedidnt I tell you? Youre always preaching about
educating. I thought I would make you a present of a freshcaught
specimen, and let you try your hand on her, and bring her up in the way
she should go."
 
"_I_ dont want her, I am sureI have more to do with em now than I
want to."
 
"Thats you Christians, all over!youll get up a society, and get some
poor missionary to spend all his days among just such heathen. But let
me see one of you that would take one into your house with you, and take
the labor of their conversion on yourselves! No when it comes to that,
they are dirty and disagreeable, and its too much care, and so on."
 
"Augustine, you know I didnt think of it in that light," said Miss
Ophelia, evidently softening. "Well, it might be a real missionary
work," said she, looking rather more favorably on the child.
 
St. Clare had touched the right string. Miss Ophelias conscientiousness
was ever on the alert. "But," she added, "I really didnt see the need
of buying this onethere are enough now, in your house, to take all my
time and skill."
 
"Well, then, Cousin," said St. Clare, drawing her aside, "I ought to
beg your pardon for my goodfornothing speeches. You are so good,
after all, that theres no sense in them. Why, the fact is, this concern
belonged to a couple of drunken creatures that keep a low restaurant
that I have to pass by every day, and I was tired of hearing her
screaming, and them beating and swearing at her. She looked bright and
funny, too, as if something might be made of herso I bought her, and
Ill give her to you. Try, now, and give her a good orthodox New England
bringing up, and see what itll make of her. You know I havent any gift
that way but Id like you to try."
 
"Well, Ill do what I can," said Miss Ophelia and she approached her
new subject very much as a person might be supposed to approach a black
spider, supposing them to have benevolent designs toward it.
 
"Shes dreadfully dirty, and half naked," she said.
 
"Well, take her down stairs, and make some of them clean and clothe her
up."
 
Miss Ophelia carried her to the kitchen regions.
 
"Dont see what Masr St. Clare wants of nother nigger!" said Dinah,
surveying the new arrival with no friendly air. "Wont have her around
under _my_ feet, _I_ know!"
 
"Pah!" said Rosa and Jane, with supreme disgust "let her keep out of
our way! What in the world Masr wanted another of these low niggers
for, I cant see!"
 
"You go long! No more nigger dan you be, Miss Rosa," said Dinah,
who felt this last remark a reflection on herself. "You seem to tink
yourself white folks. You ant nerry one, black _nor_ white, Id like to
be one or turrer."
 
Miss Ophelia saw that there was nobody in the camp that would undertake
to oversee the cleansing and dressing of the new arrival and so she
was forced to do it herself, with some very ungracious and reluctant
assistance from Jane.
 
It is not for ears polite to hear the particulars of the first toilet of
a neglected, abused child. In fact, in this world, multitudes must live
and die in a state that it would be too great a shock to the nerves of
their fellowmortals even to hear described. Miss Ophelia had a good,
strong, practical deal of resolution and she went through all the
disgusting details with heroic thoroughness, though, it must be
confessed, with no very gracious air,for endurance was the utmost
to which her principles could bring her. When she saw, on the back and
shoulders of the child, great welts and calloused spots, ineffaceable
marks of the system under which she had grown up thus far, her heart
became pitiful within her.
 
"See there!" said Jane, pointing to the marks, "dont that show shes
a limb? Well have fine works with her, I reckon. I hate these nigger
young uns! so disgusting! I wonder that Masr would buy her!"
 
The "young un" alluded to heard all these comments with the subdued and
doleful air which seemed habitual to her, only scanning, with a keen and
furtive glance of her flickering eyes, the ornaments which Jane wore in
her ears. When arrayed at last in a suit of decent and whole
clothing, her hair cropped short to her head, Miss Ophelia, with some
satisfaction, said she looked more Christianlike than she did, and in
her own mind began to mature some plans for her instruction.
 
Sitting down before her, she began to question her.
 
"How old are you, Topsy?"
 
"Dun no, Missis," said the image, with a grin that showed all her teeth.
 
"Dont know how old you are? Didnt anybody ever tell you? Who was your
mother?"
 
"Never had none!" said the child, with another grin.
 
"Never had any mother? What do you mean? Where were you born?"
 
"Never was born!" persisted Topsy, with another grin, that looked so
goblinlike, that, if Miss Ophelia had been at all nervous, she might
have fancied that she had got hold of some sooty gnome from the land
of Diablerie but Miss Ophelia was not nervous, but plain and
businesslike, and she said, with some sternness,
 
"You mustnt answer me in that way, child Im not playing with you.
Tell me where you were born, and who your father and mother were."
 
"Never was born," reiterated the creature, more emphatically "never had
no father nor mother, nor nothin. I was raised by a speculator, with
lots of others. Old Aunt Sue used to take car on us."
 
The child was evidently sincere, and Jane, breaking into a short laugh,
said,
 
"Laws, Missis, theres heaps of em. Speculators buys em up cheap, when
theys little, and gets em raised for market."
 
"How long have you lived with your master and mistress?"
 
"Dun no, Missis."
 
"Is it a year, or more, or less?"
 
"Dun no, Missis."
 
"Laws, Missis, those low negroes,they cant tell they dont know
anything about time," said Jane "they dont know what a year is they
dont know their own ages.
 
"Have you ever heard anything about God, Topsy?"
 
The child looked bewildered, but grinned as usual.
 
"Do you know who made you?"
 
"Nobody, as I knows on," said the child, with a short laugh.
 
The idea appeared to amuse her considerably for her eyes twinkled, and
she added,
 
"I spect I growd. Dont think nobody never made me."
 
"Do you know how to sew?" said Miss Ophelia, who thought she would turn
her inquiries to something more tangible.
 
"No, Missis."
 
"What can you do?what did you do for your master and mistress?"
 
"Fetch water, and wash dishes, and rub knives, and wait on folks."
 
"Were they good to you?"
 
"Spect they was," said the child, scanning Miss Ophelia cunningly.
 
Miss Ophelia rose from this encouraging colloquy St. Clare was leaning
over the back of her chair.
 
"You find virgin soil there, Cousin put in your own ideas,you wont
find many to pull up."
 
Miss Ophelias ideas of education, like all her other ideas, were
very set and definite and of the kind that prevailed in New England
a century ago, and which are still preserved in some very retired and
unsophisticated parts, where there are no railroads. As nearly as could
be expressed, they could be comprised in very few words to teach them
to mind when they were spoken to to teach them the catechism, sewing,
and reading and to whip them if they told lies. And though, of course,
in the flood of light that is now poured on education, these are left
far away in the rear, yet it is an undisputed fact that our grandmothers
raised some tolerably fair men and women under this regime, as many of
us can remember and testify. At all events, Miss Ophelia knew of nothing
else to do and, therefore, applied her mind to her heathen with the
best diligence she could command.
 
The child was announced and considered in the family as Miss Ophelias
girl and, as she was looked upon with no gracious eye in the kitchen,
Miss Ophelia resolved to confine her sphere of operation and instruction
chiefly to her own chamber. With a selfsacrifice which some of our
readers will appreciate, she resolved, instead of comfortably making her
own bed, sweeping and dusting her own chamber,which she had hitherto
done, in utter scorn of all offers of help from the chambermaid of the
establishment,to condemn herself to the martyrdom of instructing Topsy
to perform these operations,ah, woe the day! Did any of our readers
ever do the same, they will appreciate the amount of her selfsacrifice.
 
Miss Ophelia began with Topsy by taking her into her chamber, the first
morning, and solemnly commencing a course of instruction in the art and
mystery of bedmaking.
 
Behold, then, Topsy, washed and shorn of all the little braided
tails wherein her heart had delighted, arrayed in a clean gown, with
wellstarched apron, standing reverently before Miss Ophelia, with an
expression of solemnity well befitting a funeral.
 
"Now, Topsy, Im going to show you just how my bed is to be made. I am
very particular about my bed. You must learn exactly how to do it."
 
"Yes, maam," says Topsy, with a deep sigh, and a face of woful
earnestness.
 
"Now, Topsy, look herethis is the hem of the sheet,this is the
right side of the sheet, and this is the wrongwill you remember?"
 
"Yes, maam," says Topsy, with another sigh.
 
"Well, now, the under sheet you must bring over the bolster,soand
tuck it clear down under the mattress nice and smooth,so,do you
see?"
 
"Yes, maam," said Topsy, with profound attention.
 
"But the upper sheet," said Miss Ophelia, "must be brought down in this
way, and tucked under firm and smooth at the foot,so,the narrow hem
at the foot."
 
"Yes, maam," said Topsy, as beforebut we will add, what Miss Ophelia
did not see, that, during the time when the good ladys back was turned
in the zeal of her manipulations, the young disciple had contrived to
snatch a pair of gloves and a ribbon, which she had adroitly slipped
into her sleeves, and stood with her hands dutifully folded, as before.
 
"Now, Topsy, lets see _you_ do this," said Miss Ophelia, pulling off
the clothes, and seating herself.
 
Topsy, with great gravity and adroitness, went through the exercise
completely to Miss Ophelias satisfaction smoothing the sheets, patting
out every wrinkle, and exhibiting, through the whole process, a gravity
and seriousness with which her instructress was greatly edified. By an
unlucky slip, however, a fluttering fragment of the ribbon hung out of
one of her sleeves, just as she was finishing, and caught Miss Ophelias
attention. Instantly, she pounced upon it. "Whats this? You naughty,
wicked child,youve been stealing this!"
 
The ribbon was pulled out of Topsys own sleeve, yet was she not in
the least disconcerted she only looked at it with an air of the most
surprised and unconscious innocence.
 
"Laws! why, that ars Miss Feelys ribbon, ant it? How could it a got
caught in my sleeve?
 
"Topsy, you naughty girl, dont you tell me a lie,you stole that
ribbon!"
 
"Missis, I declar for t, I didntnever seed it till dis yer blessed
minnit."
 
"Topsy," said Miss Ophelia, "dont you now its wicked to tell lies?"
 
"I never tell no lies, Miss Feely," said Topsy, with virtuous gravity
"its jist the truth Ive been a tellin now, and ant nothin else."
 
"Topsy, I shall have to whip you, if you tell lies so."
 
"Laws, Missis, if yous to whip all day, couldnt say no other way,"
said Topsy, beginning to blubber. "I never seed dat ar,it must a got
caught in my sleeve. Miss Feeley must have left it on the bed, and it
got caught in the clothes, and so got in my sleeve."
 
Miss Ophelia was so indignant at the barefaced lie, that she caught the
child and shook her.
 
"Dont you tell me that again!"
 
The shake brought the glove on to the floor, from the other sleeve.
 
"There, you!" said Miss Ophelia, "will you tell me now, you didnt steal
the ribbon?"
 
Topsy now confessed to the gloves, but still persisted in denying the
ribbon.
 
"Now, Topsy," said Miss Ophelia, "if youll confess all about it, I
wont whip you this time." Thus adjured, Topsy confessed to the ribbon
and gloves, with woful protestations of penitence.
 
"Well, now, tell me. I know you must have taken other things since you
have been in the house, for I let you run about all day yesterday. Now,
tell me if you took anything, and I shant whip you."
 
"Laws, Missis! I took Miss Evas red thing she wars on her neck."
 
"You did, you naughty child!Well, what else?"
 
"I took Rosas yerrings,them red ones."
 
"Go bring them to me this minute, both of em."
 
"Laws, Missis! I cant,they s burnt up!"
 
"Burnt up!what a story! Go get em, or Ill whip you."
 
Topsy, with loud protestations, and tears, and groans, declared that she
_could_ not. "They s burnt up,they was."
 
"What did you burn em for?" said Miss Ophelia.
 
"Cause I s wicked,I is. I s mighty wicked, any how. I cant help
it."
 
Just at this moment, Eva came innocently into the room, with the
identical coral necklace on her neck.
 
"Why, Eva, where did you get your necklace?" said Miss Ophelia.
 
"Get it? Why, Ive had it on all day," said Eva.
 
"Did you have it on yesterday?"
 
"Yes and what is funny, Aunty, I had it on all night. I forgot to take
it off when I went to bed."
 
Miss Ophelia looked perfectly bewildered the more so, as Rosa, at that
instant, came into the room, with a basket of newlyironed linen poised
on her head, and the coral eardrops shaking in her ears!
 
"Im sure I cant tell anything what to do with such a child!" she said,
in despair. "What in the world did you tell me you took those things
for, Topsy?"
 
"Why, Missis said I must fess and I couldnt think of nothin else to
fess," said Topsy, rubbing her eyes.
 
"But, of course, I didnt want you to confess things you didnt do,"
said Miss Ophelia "thats telling a lie, just as much as the other."
 
"Laws, now, is it?" said Topsy, with an air of innocent wonder.
 
"La, there ant any such thing as truth in that limb," said Rosa,
looking indignantly at Topsy. "If I was Masr St. Clare, Id whip her
till the blood run. I would,Id let her catch it!"
 
"No, no Rosa," said Eva, with an air of command, which the child could
assume at times "you mustnt talk so, Rosa. I cant bear to hear it."
 
"La sakes! Miss Eva, you s so good, you dont know nothing how to get
along with niggers. Theres no way but to cut em well up, I tell ye."
 
"Rosa!" said Eva, "hush! Dont you say another word of that sort!" and
the eye of the child flashed, and her cheek deepened its color.
 
Rosa was cowed in a moment.
 
"Miss Eva has got the St. Clare blood in her, thats plain. She can
speak, for all the world, just like her papa," she said, as she passed
out of the room.
 
Eva stood looking at Topsy.
 
There stood the two children representatives of the two extremes of
society. The fair, highbred child, with her golden head, her deep eyes,
her spiritual, noble brow, and princelike movements and her
black, keen, subtle, cringing, yet acute neighbor. They stood the
representatives of their races. The Saxon, born of ages of cultivation,
command, education, physical and moral eminence the Afric, born of ages
of oppression, submission, ignorance, toil and vice!
 
Something, perhaps, of such thoughts struggled through Evas mind. But a
childs thoughts are rather dim, undefined instincts and in Evas noble
nature many such were yearning and working, for which she had no power
of utterance. When Miss Ophelia expatiated on Topsys naughty, wicked
conduct, the child looked perplexed and sorrowful, but said, sweetly.
 
"Poor Topsy, why need you steal? Youre going to be taken good care of
now. Im sure Id rather give you anything of mine, than have you steal
it."
 
It was the first word of kindness the child had ever heard in her life
and the sweet tone and manner struck strangely on the wild, rude
heart, and a sparkle of something like a tear shone in the keen, round,
glittering eye but it was followed by the short laugh and habitual
grin. No! the ear that has never heard anything but abuse is strangely
incredulous of anything so heavenly as kindness and Topsy only thought
Evas speech something funny and inexplicable,she did not believe it.
 
But what was to be done with Topsy? Miss Ophelia found the case a
puzzler her rules for bringing up didnt seem to apply. She thought she
would take time to think of it and, by the way of gaining time, and in
hopes of some indefinite moral virtues supposed to be inherent in dark
closets, Miss Ophelia shut Topsy up in one till she had arranged her
ideas further on the subject.
 
"I dont see," said Miss Ophelia to St. Clare, "how Im going to manage
that child, without whipping her."
 
"Well, whip her, then, to your hearts content Ill give you full power
to do what you like."
 
"Children always have to be whipped," said Miss Ophelia "I never heard
of bringing them up without."
 
"O, well, certainly," said St. Clare "do as you think best. Only Ill
make one suggestion Ive seen this child whipped with a poker, knocked
down with the shovel or tongs, whichever came handiest, c. and, seeing
that she is used to that style of operation, I think your whippings will
have to be pretty energetic, to make much impression."
 
"What is to be done with her, then?" said Miss Ophelia.
 
"You have started a serious question," said St. Clare "I wish youd
answer it. What is to be done with a human being that can be governed
only by the lash,_that_ fails,its a very common state of things
down here!"
 
"Im sure I dont know I never saw such a child as this."
 
"Such children are very common among us, and such men and women, too.
How are they to be governed?" said St. Clare.
 
"Im sure its more than I can say," said Miss Ophelia.
 
"Or I either," said St. Clare. "The horrid cruelties and outrages that
once and a while find their way into the papers,such cases as Prues,
for example,what do they come from? In many cases, it is a gradual
hardening process on both sides,the owner growing more and more
cruel, as the servant more and more callous. Whipping and abuse are like
laudanum you have to double the dose as the sensibilities decline.
I saw this very early when I became an owner and I resolved never to
begin, because I did not know when I should stop,and I resolved,
at least, to protect my own moral nature. The consequence is, that my
servants act like spoiled children but I think that better than for us
both to be brutalized together. You have talked a great deal about our
responsibilities in educating, Cousin. I really wanted you to _try_ with
one child, who is a specimen of thousands among us."
 
"It is your system makes such children," said Miss Ophelia.
 
"I know it but they are _made_,they exist,and what _is_ to be done
with them?"
 
"Well, I cant say I thank you for the experiment. But, then, as it
appears to be a duty, I shall persevere and try, and do the best I
can," said Miss Ophelia and Miss Ophelia, after this, did labor, with
a commendable degree of zeal and energy, on her new subject. She
instituted regular hours and employments for her, and undertook to teach
her to read and sew.
 
In the former art, the child was quick enough. She learned her letters
as if by magic, and was very soon able to read plain reading but the
sewing was a more difficult matter. The creature was as lithe as a
cat, and as active as a monkey, and the confinement of sewing was her
abomination so she broke her needles, threw them slyly out of the
window, or down in chinks of the walls she tangled, broke, and
dirtied her thread, or, with a sly movement, would throw a spool away
altogether. Her motions were almost as quick as those of a practised
conjurer, and her command of her face quite as great and though Miss
Ophelia could not help feeling that so many accidents could not possibly
happen in succession, yet she could not, without a watchfulness which
would leave her no time for anything else, detect her.
 
Topsy was soon a noted character in the establishment. Her talent for
every species of drollery, grimace, and mimicry,for dancing, tumbling,
climbing, singing, whistling, imitating every sound that hit her
fancy,seemed inexhaustible. In her playhours, she invariably had
every child in the establishment at her heels, openmouthed with
admiration and wonder,not excepting Miss Eva, who appeared to be
fascinated by her wild diablerie, as a dove is sometimes charmed by
a glittering serpent. Miss Ophelia was uneasy that Eva should fancy
Topsys society so much, and implored St. Clare to forbid it.
 
"Poh! let the child alone," said St. Clare. "Topsy will do her good."
 
"But so depraved a child,are you not afraid she will teach her some
mischief?"
 
"She cant teach her mischief she might teach it to some children, but
evil rolls off Evas mind like dew off a cabbageleaf,not a drop sinks
in."
 
"Dont be too sure," said Miss Ophelia. "I know Id never let a child of
mine play with Topsy."
 
"Well, your children neednt," said St. Clare, "but mine may if Eva
could have been spoiled, it would have been done years ago."
 
Topsy was at first despised and contemned by the upper servants. They
soon found reason to alter their opinion. It was very soon discovered
that whoever cast an indignity on Topsy was sure to meet with some
inconvenient accident shortly aftereither a pair of earrings or
some cherished trinket would be missing, or an article of dress would
be suddenly found utterly ruined, or the person would stumble
accidently into a pail of hot water, or a libation of dirty slop would
unaccountably deluge them from above when in full gala dressand on all
these occasions, when investigation was made, there was nobody found to
stand sponsor for the indignity. Topsy was cited, and had up before
all the domestic judicatories, time and again but always sustained her
examinations with most edifying innocence and gravity of appearance.
Nobody in the world ever doubted who did the things but not a scrap of
any direct evidence could be found to establish the suppositions, and
Miss Ophelia was too just to feel at liberty to proceed to any length
without it.
 
The mischiefs done were always so nicely timed, also, as further to
shelter the aggressor. Thus, the times for revenge on Rosa and Jane,
the two chamber maids, were always chosen in those seasons when as not
unfrequently happened they were in disgrace with their mistress, when
any complaint from them would of course meet with no sympathy. In short,
Topsy soon made the household understand the propriety of letting her
alone and she was let alone, accordingly.
 
Topsy was smart and energetic in all manual operations, learning
everything that was taught her with surprising quickness. With a few
lessons, she had learned to do the proprieties of Miss Ophelias chamber
in a way with which even that particular lady could find no fault.
Mortal hands could not lay spread smoother, adjust pillows more
accurately, sweep and dust and arrange more perfectly, than Topsy, when
she chose,but she didnt very often choose. If Miss Ophelia, after
three or four days of careful patient supervision, was so sanguine as
to suppose that Topsy had at last fallen into her way, could do without
overlooking, and so go off and busy herself about something else, Topsy
would hold a perfect carnival of confusion, for some one or two hours.
Instead of making the bed, she would amuse herself with pulling off the
pillowcases, butting her woolly head among the pillows, till it would
sometimes be grotesquely ornamented with feathers sticking out in
various directions she would climb the posts, and hang head downward
from the tops flourish the sheets and spreads all over the apartment
dress the bolster up in Miss Ophelias nightclothes, and enact various
performances with that,singing and whistling, and making grimaces
at herself in the lookingglass in short, as Miss Ophelia phrased it,
"raising Cain" generally.
 
On one occasion, Miss Ophelia found Topsy with her very best scarlet
India Canton crape shawl wound round her head for a turban, going on
with her rehearsals before the glass in great style,Miss Ophelia
having, with carelessness most unheardof in her, left the key for once
in her drawer.
 
"Topsy!" she would say, when at the end of all patience, "what does make
you act so?"
 
"Dunno, Missis,I spects cause I s so wicked!"
 
"I dont know anything what I shall do with you, Topsy."
 
"Law, Missis, you must whip me my old Missis allers whipped me. I ant
used to workin unless I gets whipped."
 
"Why, Topsy, I dont want to whip you. You can do well, if youve a mind
to what is the reason you wont?"
 
"Laws, Missis, I s used to whippin I spects its good for me."
 
Miss Ophelia tried the recipe, and Topsy invariably made a terrible
commotion, screaming, groaning and imploring, though half an hour
afterwards, when roosted on some projection of the balcony, and
surrounded by a flock of admiring "young uns," she would express the
utmost contempt of the whole affair.
 
"Law, Miss Feely whip!wouldnt kill a skeeter, her whippins. Oughter
see how old Masr made the flesh fly old Masr knowd how!"
 
Topsy always made great capital of her own sins and enormities,
evidently considering them as something peculiarly distinguishing.
 
"Law, you niggers," she would say to some of her auditors, "does you
know you s all sinners? Well, you iseverybody is. White folks is
sinners too,Miss Feely says so but I spects niggers is the biggest
ones but lor! ye ant any on ye up to me. I s so awful wicked there
cant nobody do nothin with me. I used to keep old Missis a swarin at
me half de time. I spects I s the wickedest critter in the world"
and Topsy would cut a summerset, and come up brisk and shining on to a
higher perch, and evidently plume herself on the distinction.
 
Miss Ophelia busied herself very earnestly on Sundays, teaching Topsy
the catechism. Topsy had an uncommon verbal memory, and committed with a
fluency that greatly encouraged her instructress.
 
"What good do you expect it is going to do her?" said St. Clare.
 
"Why, it always has done children good. Its what children always have
to learn, you know," said Miss Ophelia.
 
"Understand it or not," said St. Clare.
 
"O, children never understand it at the time but, after they are grown
up, itll come to them."
 
"Mine hasnt come to me yet," said St. Clare, "though Ill bear
testimony that you put it into me pretty thoroughly when I was a boy."
 
"Ah, you were always good at learning, Augustine. I used to have great
hopes of you," said Miss Ophelia.
 
"Well, havent you now?" said St. Clare.
 
"I wish you were as good as you were when you were a boy, Augustine."
 
"So do I, thats a fact, Cousin," said St. Clare. "Well, go ahead and
catechize Topsy may be youll make out something yet."
 
Topsy, who had stood like a black statue during this discussion, with
hands decently folded, now, at a signal from Miss Ophelia, went on
 
"Our first parents, being left to the freedom of their own will, fell
from the state wherein they were created."
 
Topsys eyes twinkled, and she looked inquiringly.
 
"What is it, Topsy?" said Miss Ophelia.
 
"Please, Missis, was dat ar state Kintuck?"
 
"What state, Topsy?"
 
"Dat state dey fell out of. I used to hear Masr tell how we came down
from Kintuck."
 
St. Clare laughed.
 
"Youll have to give her a meaning, or shell make one," said he. "There
seems to be a theory of emigration suggested there."
 
"O! Augustine, be still," said Miss Ophelia "how can I do anything, if
you will be laughing?"
 
"Well, I wont disturb the exercises again, on my honor" and St. Clare
took his paper into the parlor, and sat down, till Topsy had finished
her recitations. They were all very well, only that now and then she
would oddly transpose some important words, and persist in the mistake,
in spite of every effort to the contrary and St. Clare, after all his
promises of goodness, took a wicked pleasure in these mistakes, calling
Topsy to him whenever he had a mind to amuse himself, and getting her to
repeat the offending passages, in spite of Miss Ophelias remonstrances.
 
"How do you think I can do anything with the child, if you will go on
so, Augustine?" she would say.
 
"Well, it is too bad,I wont again but I do like to hear the droll
little image stumble over those big words!"
 
"But you confirm her in the wrong way."
 
"Whats the odds? One word is as good as another to her."
 
"You wanted me to bring her up right and you ought to remember she is a
reasonable creature, and be careful of your influence over her."
 
"O, dismal! so I ought but, as Topsy herself says, I s so wicked!"
 
In very much this way Topsys training proceeded, for a year or
two,Miss Ophelia worrying herself, from day to day, with her, as a
kind of chronic plague, to whose inflictions she became, in time, as
accustomed, as persons sometimes do to the neuralgia or sick headache.
 
St. Clare took the same kind of amusement in the child that a man might
in the tricks of a parrot or a pointer. Topsy, whenever her sins brought
her into disgrace in other quarters, always took refuge behind his
chair and St. Clare, in one way or other, would make peace for her.
From him she got many a stray picayune, which she laid out in nuts and
candies, and distributed, with careless generosity, to all the children
in the family for Topsy, to do her justice, was goodnatured and
liberal, and only spiteful in selfdefence. She is fairly introduced
into our _corps de ballet_, and will figure, from time to time, in her
turn, with other performers.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXI
 
Kentuck
 
 
Our readers may not be unwilling to glance back, for a brief interval,
at Uncle Toms Cabin, on the Kentucky farm, and see what has been
transpiring among those whom he had left behind.
 
It was late in the summer afternoon, and the doors and windows of the
large parlor all stood open, to invite any stray breeze, that might feel
in a good humor, to enter. Mr. Shelby sat in a large hall opening
into the room, and running through the whole length of the house, to
a balcony on either end. Leisurely tipped back on one chair, with his
heels in another, he was enjoying his afterdinner cigar. Mrs. Shelby
sat in the door, busy about some fine sewing she seemed like one who
had something on her mind, which she was seeking an opportunity to
introduce.
 
"Do you know," she said, "that Chloe has had a letter from Tom?"
 
"Ah! has she? Tom s got some friend there, it seems. How is the old
boy?"
 
"He has been bought by a very fine family, I should think," said Mrs.
Shelby,"is kindly treated, and has not much to do."
 
"Ah! well, Im glad of it,very glad," said Mr. Shelby, heartily. "Tom,
I suppose, will get reconciled to a Southern residencehardly want to
come up here again."
 
"On the contrary he inquires very anxiously," said Mrs. Shelby, "when
the money for his redemption is to be raised."
 
"Im sure _I_ dont know," said Mr. Shelby. "Once get business running
wrong, there does seem to be no end to it. Its like jumping from one
bog to another, all through a swamp borrow of one to pay another, and
then borrow of another to pay one,and these confounded notes falling
due before a man has time to smoke a cigar and turn round,dunning
letters and dunning messages,all scamper and hurryscurry."
 
"It does seem to me, my dear, that something might be done to straighten
matters. Suppose we sell off all the horses, and sell one of your farms,
and pay up square?"
 
"O, ridiculous, Emily! You are the finest woman in Kentucky but still
you havent sense to know that you dont understand businesswomen
never do, and never can.
 
"But, at least," said Mrs. Shelby, "could not you give me some little
insight into yours a list of all your debts, at least, and of all
that is owed to you, and let me try and see if I cant help you to
economize."
 
"O, bother! dont plague me, Emily!I cant tell exactly. I know
somewhere about what things are likely to be but theres no trimming
and squaring my affairs, as Chloe trims crust off her pies. You dont
know anything about business, I tell you."
 
And Mr. Shelby, not knowing any other way of enforcing his ideas, raised
his voice,a mode of arguing very convenient and convincing, when a
gentleman is discussing matters of business with his wife.
 
Mrs. Shelby ceased talking, with something of a sigh. The fact was,
that though her husband had stated she was a woman, she had a clear,
energetic, practical mind, and a force of character every way superior
to that of her husband so that it would not have been so very absurd
a supposition, to have allowed her capable of managing, as Mr. Shelby
supposed. Her heart was set on performing her promise to Tom and Aunt
Chloe, and she sighed as discouragements thickened around her.
 
"Dont you think we might in some way contrive to raise that money? Poor
Aunt Chloe! her heart is so set on it!"
 
"Im sorry, if it is. I think I was premature in promising. Im not
sure, now, but its the best way to tell Chloe, and let her make up
her mind to it. Tomll have another wife, in a year or two and she had
better take up with somebody else."
 
"Mr. Shelby, I have taught my people that their marriages are as sacred
as ours. I never could think of giving Chloe such advice."
 
"Its a pity, wife, that you have burdened them with a morality above
their condition and prospects. I always thought so."
 
"Its only the morality of the Bible, Mr. Shelby."
 
"Well, well, Emily, I dont pretend to interfere with your religious
notions only they seem extremely unfitted for people in that
condition."
 
"They are, indeed," said Mrs. Shelby, "and that is why, from my soul,
I hate the whole thing. I tell you, my dear, _I_ cannot absolve myself
from the promises I make to these helpless creatures. If I can get the
money no other way I will take musicscholarsI could get enough, I
know, and earn the money myself."
 
"You wouldnt degrade yourself that way, Emily? I never could consent to
it."
 
"Degrade! would it degrade me as much as to break my faith with the
helpless? No, indeed!"
 
"Well, you are always heroic and transcendental," said Mr. Shelby,
"but I think you had better think before you undertake such a piece of
Quixotism."
 
Here the conversation was interrupted by the appearance of Aunt Chloe,
at the end of the verandah.
 
"If you please, Missis," said she.
 
"Well, Chloe, what is it?" said her mistress, rising, and going to the
end of the balcony.
 
"If Missis would come and look at dis yer lot o poetry."
 
Chloe had a particular fancy for calling poultry poetry,an application
of language in which she always persisted, notwithstanding frequent
corrections and advisings from the young members of the family.
 
"La sakes!" she would say, "I cant see one jis good as turry,poetry
suthin good, any how" and so poetry Chloe continued to call it.
 
Mrs. Shelby smiled as she saw a prostrate lot of chickens and ducks,
over which Chloe stood, with a very grave face of consideration.
 
"Im a thinkin whether Missis would be a havin a chicken pie o dese
yer."
 
"Really, Aunt Chloe, I dont much careserve them any way you like."
 
Chloe stood handling them over abstractedly it was quite evident that
the chickens were not what she was thinking of. At last, with the short
laugh with which her tribe often introduce a doubtful proposal, she
said,
 
"Laws me, Missis! what should Masr and Missis be a troublin theirselves
bout de money, and not a usin whats right in der hands?" and Chloe
laughed again.
 
"I dont understand you, Chloe," said Mrs. Shelby, nothing doubting,
from her knowledge of Chloes manner, that she had heard every word of
the conversation that had passed between her and her husband.
 
"Why, laws me, Missis!" said Chloe, laughing again, "other folks hires
out der niggers and makes money on em! Dont keep sich a tribe eatin
em out of house and home."
 
"Well, Chloe, who do you propose that we should hire out?"
 
"Laws! I ant a proposin nothin only Sam he said der was one of dese
yer _perfectioners_, dey calls em, in Louisville, said he wanted a good
hand at cake and pastry and said hed give four dollars a week to one,
he did."
 
"Well, Chloe."
 
"Well, laws, I s a thinkin, Missis, its time Sally was put along to
be doin something. Sally s been under my care, now, dis some time, and
she does most as well as me, considerin and if Missis would only let
me go, I would help fetch up de money. I ant afraid to put my cake, nor
pies nother, long side no _perfectioners_.
 
"Confectioners, Chloe."
 
"Law sakes, Missis! tant no oddswords is so curis, cant never get
em right!"
 
"But, Chloe, do you want to leave your children?"
 
"Laws, Missis! de boys is big enough to do days works dey does well
enough and Sally, shell take de baby,shes such a peart young un,
she wont take no lookin arter."
 
"Louisville is a good way off."
 
"Law sakes! whos afeard?its down river, somer near my old man,
perhaps?" said Chloe, speaking the last in the tone of a question, and
looking at Mrs. Shelby.
 
"No, Chloe its many a hundred miles off," said Mrs. Shelby.
 
Chloes countenance fell.
 
"Never mind your going there shall bring you nearer, Chloe. Yes, you
may go and your wages shall every cent of them be laid aside for your
husbands redemption."
 
As when a bright sunbeam turns a dark cloud to silver, so Chloes dark
face brightened immediately,it really shone.
 
"Laws! if Missis isnt too good! I was thinking of dat ar very thing
cause I shouldnt need no clothes, nor shoes, nor nothin,I could save
every cent. How many weeks is der in a year, Missis?"
 
"Fiftytwo," said Mrs. Shelby.
 
"Laws! now, dere is? and four dollars for each on em. Why, how much d
dat ar be?"
 
"Two hundred and eight dollars," said Mrs. Shelby.
 
"Whye!" said Chloe, with an accent of surprise and delight "and how
long would it take me to work it out, Missis?"
 
"Some four or five years, Chloe but, then, you neednt do it all,I
shall add something to it."
 
"I wouldnt hear to Missis givin lessons nor nothin. Masrs quite
right in dat art wouldnt do, no ways. I hope none our family ever
be brought to dat ar, while I s got hands."
 
"Dont fear, Chloe Ill take care of the honor of the family," said
Mrs. Shelby, smiling. "But when do you expect to go?"
 
"Well, I want spectin nothin only Sam, hes a gwine to de river with
some colts, and he said I could go long with him so I jes put my things
together. If Missis was willin, Id go with Sam tomorrow morning, if
Missis would write my pass, and write me a commendation."
 
"Well, Chloe, Ill attend to it, if Mr. Shelby has no objections. I must
speak to him."
 
Mrs. Shelby went up stairs, and Aunt Chloe, delighted, went out to her
cabin, to make her preparation.
 
"Law sakes, Masr George! ye didnt know I s a gwine to Louisville
tomorrow!" she said to George, as entering her cabin, he found her busy
in sorting over her babys clothes. "I thought Id jis look over siss
things, and get em straightened up. But Im gwine, Masr George,gwine
to have four dollars a week and Missis is gwine to lay it all up, to
buy back my old man agin!"
 
"Whew!" said George, "heres a stroke of business, to be sure! How are
you going?"
 
"Tomorrow, wid Sam. And now, Masr George, I knows youll jis sit down
and write to my old man, and tell him all about it,wont ye?"
 
"To be sure," said George "Uncle Tomll be right glad to hear from us.
Ill go right in the house, for paper and ink and then, you know, Aunt
Chloe, I can tell about the new colts and all."
 
"Sartin, sartin, Masr George you go long, and Ill get ye up a bit o
chicken, or some sich ye wont have many more suppers wid yer poor old
aunty."
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXII
 
"The Grass Withereththe Flower Fadeth"
 
 
Life passes, with us all, a day at a time so it passed with our friend
Tom, till two years were gone. Though parted from all his soul held
dear, and though often yearning for what lay beyond, still was he never
positively and consciously miserable for, so well is the harp of human
feeling strung, that nothing but a crash that breaks every string can
wholly mar its harmony and, on looking back to seasons which in review
appear to us as those of deprivation and trial, we can remember that
each hour, as it glided, brought its diversions and alleviations, so
that, though not happy wholly, we were not, either, wholly miserable.
 
Tom read, in his only literary cabinet, of one who had "learned in
whatsoever state he was, therewith to be content." It seemed to him
good and reasonable doctrine, and accorded well with the settled and
thoughtful habit which he had acquired from the reading of that same
book.
 
His letter homeward, as we related in the last chapter, was in due time
answered by Master George, in a good, round, schoolboy hand, that
Tom said might be read "most acrost the room." It contained various
refreshing items of home intelligence, with which our reader is fully
acquainted stated how Aunt Chloe had been hired out to a confectioner
in Louisville, where her skill in the pastry line was gaining wonderful
sums of money, all of which, Tom was informed, was to be laid up to go
to make up the sum of his redemption money Mose and Pete were thriving,
and the baby was trotting all about the house, under the care of Sally
and the family generally.
 
Toms cabin was shut up for the present but George expatiated
brilliantly on ornaments and additions to be made to it when Tom came
back.
 
The rest of this letter gave a list of Georges school studies, each
one headed by a flourishing capital and also told the names of four new
colts that appeared on the premises since Tom left and stated, in the
same connection, that father and mother were well. The style of the
letter was decidedly concise and terse but Tom thought it the most
wonderful specimen of composition that had appeared in modern times. He
was never tired of looking at it, and even held a council with Eva on
the expediency of getting it framed, to hang up in his room. Nothing but
the difficulty of arranging it so that both sides of the page would show
at once stood in the way of this undertaking.
 
The friendship between Tom and Eva had grown with the childs growth. It
would be hard to say what place she held in the soft, impressible heart
of her faithful attendant. He loved her as something frail and earthly,
yet almost worshipped her as something heavenly and divine. He gazed on
her as the Italian sailor gazes on his image of the child Jesus,with a
mixture of reverence and tenderness and to humor her graceful fancies,
and meet those thousand simple wants which invest childhood like
a manycolored rainbow, was Toms chief delight. In the market, at
morning, his eyes were always on the flowerstalls for rare bouquets
for her, and the choicest peach or orange was slipped into his pocket to
give to her when he came back and the sight that pleased him most was
her sunny head looking out the gate for his distant approach, and her
childish questions,"Well, Uncle Tom, what have you got for me today?"
 
Nor was Eva less zealous in kind offices, in return. Though a child, she
was a beautiful readera fine musical ear, a quick poetic fancy, and
an instinctive sympathy with whats grand and noble, made her such a
reader of the Bible as Tom had never before heard. At first, she read to
please her humble friend but soon her own earnest nature threw out its
tendrils, and wound itself around the majestic book and Eva loved it,
because it woke in her strange yearnings, and strong, dim emotions, such
as impassioned, imaginative children love to feel.
 
The parts that pleased her most were the Revelations and the
Prophecies,parts whose dim and wondrous imagery, and fervent
language, impressed her the more, that she questioned vainly of their
meaningand she and her simple friend, the old child and the young
one, felt just alike about it. All that they knew was, that they spoke
of a glory to be revealed,a wondrous something yet to come, wherein
their soul rejoiced, yet knew not why and though it be not so in the
physical, yet in moral science that which cannot be understood is not
always profitless. For the soul awakes, a trembling stranger, between
two dim eternities,the eternal past, the eternal future. The light
shines only on a small space around her therefore, she needs must yearn
towards the unknown and the voices and shadowy movings which come to
her from out the cloudy pillar of inspiration have each one echoes and
answers in her own expecting nature. Its mystic imagery are so many
talismans and gems inscribed with unknown hieroglyphics she folds them
in her bosom, and expects to read them when she passes beyond the veil.
 
At this time in our story, the whole St. Clare establishment is, for the
time being, removed to their villa on Lake Pontchartrain. The heats of
summer had driven all who were able to leave the sultry and unhealthy
city, to seek the shores of the lake, and its cool seabreezes.
 
St. Clares villa was an East Indian cottage, surrounded by light
verandahs of bamboowork, and opening on all sides into gardens and
pleasuregrounds. The common sittingroom opened on to a large garden,
fragrant with every picturesque plant and flower of the tropics, where
winding paths ran down to the very shores of the lake, whose silvery
sheet of water lay there, rising and falling in the sunbeams,a picture
never for an hour the same, yet every hour more beautiful.
 
It is now one of those intensely golden sunsets which kindles the whole
horizon into one blaze of glory, and makes the water another sky. The
lake lay in rosy or golden streaks, save where whitewinged vessels
glided hither and thither, like so many spirits, and little golden
stars twinkled through the glow, and looked down at themselves as they
trembled in the water.
 
Tom and Eva were seated on a little mossy seat, in an arbor, at the foot
of the garden. It was Sunday evening, and Evas Bible lay open on her
knee. She read,"And I saw a sea of glass, mingled with fire."
 
"Tom," said Eva, suddenly stopping, and pointing to the lake, "there t
is."
 
"What, Miss Eva?"
 
"Dont you see,there?" said the child, pointing to the glassy water,
which, as it rose and fell, reflected the golden glow of the sky.
"Theres a sea of glass, mingled with fire."
 
"True enough, Miss Eva," said Tom and Tom sang
 
     "O, had I the wings of the morning,
     Id fly away to Canaans shore
     Bright angels should convey me home,
     To the new Jerusalem."
 
"Where do you suppose new Jerusalem is, Uncle Tom?" said Eva.
 
"O, up in the clouds, Miss Eva."
 
"Then I think I see it," said Eva. "Look in those clouds!they look
like great gates of pearl and you can see beyond themfar, far
offits all gold. Tom, sing about spirits bright."
 
Tom sung the words of a wellknown Methodist hymn,
 
     "I see a band of spirits bright,
     That taste the glories there
     They all are robed in spotless white,
     And conquering palms they bear."
 
"Uncle Tom, Ive seen _them_," said Eva.
 
Tom had no doubt of it at all it did not surprise him in the least.
If Eva had told him she had been to heaven, he would have thought it
entirely probable.
 
"They come to me sometimes in my sleep, those spirits" and Evas eyes
grew dreamy, and she hummed, in a low voice,
 
     "They are all robed in spotless white,
     And conquering palms they bear."
 
"Uncle Tom," said Eva, "Im going there."
 
"Where, Miss Eva?"
 
The child rose, and pointed her little hand to the sky the glow of
evening lit her golden hair and flushed cheek with a kind of unearthly
radiance, and her eyes were bent earnestly on the skies.
 
"Im going _there_," she said, "to the spirits bright, Tom _Im going,
before long_."
 
The faithful old heart felt a sudden thrust and Tom thought how often
he had noticed, within six months, that Evas little hands had grown
thinner, and her skin more transparent, and her breath shorter and how,
when she ran or played in the garden, as she once could for hours, she
became soon so tired and languid. He had heard Miss Ophelia speak often
of a cough, that all her medicaments could not cure and even now that
fervent cheek and little hand were burning with hectic fever and yet
the thought that Evas words suggested had never come to him till now.
 
Has there ever been a child like Eva? Yes, there have been but their
names are always on gravestones, and their sweet smiles, their heavenly
eyes, their singular words and ways, are among the buried treasures of
yearning hearts. In how many families do you hear the legend that all
the goodness and graces of the living are nothing to the peculiar charms
of one who _is not_. It is as if heaven had an especial band of angels,
whose office it was to sojourn for a season here, and endear to them the
wayward human heart, that they might bear it upward with them in
their homeward flight. When you see that deep, spiritual light in the
eye,when the little soul reveals itself in words sweeter and wiser
than the ordinary words of children,hope not to retain that child for
the seal of heaven is on it, and the light of immortality looks out from
its eyes.
 
Even so, beloved Eva! fair star of thy dwelling! Thou art passing away
but they that love thee dearest know it not.
 
The colloquy between Tom and Eva was interrupted by a hasty call from
Miss Ophelia.
 
"EvaEva!why, child, the dew is falling you mustnt be out there!"
 
Eva and Tom hastened in.
 
Miss Ophelia was old, and skilled in the tactics of nursing. She was
from New England, and knew well the first guileful footsteps of that
soft, insidious disease, which sweeps away so many of the fairest
and loveliest, and, before one fibre of life seems broken, seals them
irrevocably for death.
 
She had noted the slight, dry cough, the daily brightening cheek
nor could the lustre of the eye, and the airy buoyancy born of fever,
deceive her.
 
She tried to communicate her fears to St. Clare but he threw back
her suggestions with a restless petulance, unlike his usual careless
goodhumor.
 
"Dont be croaking, Cousin,I hate it!" he would say "dont you see
that the child is only growing. Children always lose strength when they
grow fast."
 
"But she has that cough!"
 
"O! nonsense of that cough!it is not anything. She has taken a little
cold, perhaps."
 
"Well, that was just the way Eliza Jane was taken, and Ellen and Maria
Sanders."
 
"O! stop these hobgoblin nurse legends. You old hands got so wise, that
a child cannot cough, or sneeze, but you see desperation and ruin at
hand. Only take care of the child, keep her from the night air, and
dont let her play too hard, and shell do well enough."
 
So St. Clare said but he grew nervous and restless. He watched Eva
feverishly day by day, as might be told by the frequency with which
he repeated over that "the child was quite well"that there wasnt
anything in that cough,it was only some little stomach affection, such
as children often had. But he kept by her more than before, took her
oftener to ride with him, brought home every few days some receipt or
strengthening mixture,"not," he said, "that the child _needed_ it, but
then it would not do her any harm."
 
If it must be told, the thing that struck a deeper pang to his heart
than anything else was the daily increasing maturity of the childs mind
and feelings. While still retaining all a childs fanciful graces, yet
she often dropped, unconsciously, words of such a reach of thought, and
strange unworldly wisdom, that they seemed to be an inspiration. At such
times, St. Clare would feel a sudden thrill, and clasp her in his arms,
as if that fond clasp could save her and his heart rose up with wild
determination to keep her, never to let her go.
 
The childs whole heart and soul seemed absorbed in works of love and
kindness. Impulsively generous she had always been but there was
a touching and womanly thoughtfulness about her now, that every one
noticed. She still loved to play with Topsy, and the various colored
children but she now seemed rather a spectator than an actor of their
plays, and she would sit for half an hour at a time, laughing at the odd
tricks of Topsy,and then a shadow would seem to pass across her face,
her eyes grew misty, and her thoughts were afar.
 
"Mamma," she said, suddenly, to her mother, one day, "why dont we teach
our servants to read?"
 
"What a question child! People never do."
 
"Why dont they?" said Eva.
 
"Because it is no use for them to read. It dont help them to work any
better, and they are not made for anything else."
 
"But they ought to read the Bible, mamma, to learn Gods will."
 
"O! they can get that read to them all _they_ need."
 
"It seems to me, mamma, the Bible is for every one to read themselves.
They need it a great many times when there is nobody to read it."
 
"Eva, you are an odd child," said her mother.
 
"Miss Ophelia has taught Topsy to read," continued Eva.
 
"Yes, and you see how much good it does. Topsy is the worst creature I
ever saw!"
 
"Heres poor Mammy!" said Eva. "She does love the Bible so much, and
wishes so she could read! And what will she do when I cant read to
her?"
 
Marie was busy, turning over the contents of a drawer, as she answered,
 
"Well, of course, by and by, Eva, you will have other things to think
of besides reading the Bible round to servants. Not but that is very
proper Ive done it myself, when I had health. But when you come to
be dressing and going into company, you wont have time. See here!" she
added, "these jewels Im going to give you when you come out. I wore
them to my first ball. I can tell you, Eva, I made a sensation."
 
Eva took the jewelcase, and lifted from it a diamond necklace. Her
large, thoughtful eyes rested on them, but it was plain her thoughts
were elsewhere.
 
"How sober you look child!" said Marie.
 
"Are these worth a great deal of money, mamma?"
 
"To be sure, they are. Father sent to France for them. They are worth a
small fortune."
 
"I wish I had them," said Eva, "to do what I pleased with!"
 
"What would you do with them?"
 
"Id sell them, and buy a place in the free states, and take all our
people there, and hire teachers, to teach them to read and write."
 
Eva was cut short by her mothers laughing.
 
"Set up a boardingschool! Wouldnt you teach them to play on the piano,
and paint on velvet?"
 
"Id teach them to read their own Bible, and write their own letters,
and read letters that are written to them," said Eva, steadily. "I know,
mamma, it does come very hard on them that they cant do these things.
Tom feels itMammy does,a great many of them do. I think its wrong."
 
"Come, come, Eva you are only a child! You dont know anything about
these things," said Marie "besides, your talking makes my head ache."
 
Marie always had a headache on hand for any conversation that did not
exactly suit her.
 
Eva stole away but after that, she assiduously gave Mammy reading
lessons.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXIII
 
Henrique
 
 
About this time, St. Clares brother Alfred, with his eldest son, a boy
of twelve, spent a day or two with the family at the lake.
 
No sight could be more singular and beautiful than that of these twin
brothers. Nature, instead of instituting resemblances between them, had
made them opposites on every point yet a mysterious tie seemed to unite
them in a closer friendship than ordinary.
 
They used to saunter, arm in arm, up and down the alleys and walks
of the garden. Augustine, with his blue eyes and golden hair, his
ethereally flexible form and vivacious features and Alfred, darkeyed,
with haughty Roman profile, firmlyknit limbs, and decided bearing. They
were always abusing each others opinions and practices, and yet never
a whit the less absorbed in each others society in fact, the very
contrariety seemed to unite them, like the attraction between opposite
poles of the magnet.
 
Henrique, the eldest son of Alfred, was a noble, darkeyed, princely
boy, full of vivacity and spirit and, from the first moment of
introduction, seemed to be perfectly fascinated by the spirituelle
graces of his cousin Evangeline.
 
Eva had a little pet pony, of a snowy whiteness. It was easy as a
cradle, and as gentle as its little mistress and this pony was now
brought up to the back verandah by Tom, while a little mulatto boy of
about thirteen led along a small black Arabian, which had just been
imported, at a great expense, for Henrique.
 
Henrique had a boys pride in his new possession and, as he advanced
and took the reins out of the hands of his little groom, he looked
carefully over him, and his brow darkened.
 
"Whats this, Dodo, you little lazy dog! you havent rubbed my horse
down, this morning."
 
"Yes, Masr," said Dodo, submissively "he got that dust on his own
self."
 
"You rascal, shut your mouth!" said Henrique, violently raising his
ridingwhip. "How dare you speak?"
 
The boy was a handsome, brighteyed mulatto, of just Henriques size,
and his curling hair hung round a high, bold forehead. He had white
blood in his veins, as could be seen by the quick flush in his cheek,
and the sparkle of his eye, as he eagerly tried to speak.
 
"Masr Henrique!" he began.
 
Henrique struck him across the face with his ridingwhip, and, seizing
one of his arms, forced him on to his knees, and beat him till he was
out of breath.
 
"There, you impudent dog! Now will you learn not to answer back when I
speak to you? Take the horse back, and clean him properly. Ill teach
you your place!"
 
"Young Masr," said Tom, "I specs what he was gwine to say was, that the
horse would roll when he was bringing him up from the stable hes so
full of spirits,thats the way he got that dirt on him I looked to
his cleaning."
 
"You hold your tongue till youre asked to speak!" said Henrique,
turning on his heel, and walking up the steps to speak to Eva, who stood
in her ridingdress.
 
"Dear Cousin, Im sorry this stupid fellow has kept you waiting," he
said. "Lets sit down here, on this seat till they come. Whats the
matter, Cousin?you look sober."
 
"How could you be so cruel and wicked to poor Dodo?" asked Eva.
 
"Cruel,wicked!" said the boy, with unaffected surprise. "What do you
mean, dear Eva?"
 
"I dont want you to call me dear Eva, when you do so," said Eva.
 
"Dear Cousin, you dont know Dodo its the only way to manage him,
hes so full of lies and excuses. The only way is to put him down at
once,not let him open his mouth thats the way papa manages."
 
"But Uncle Tom said it was an accident, and he never tells what isnt
true."
 
"Hes an uncommon old nigger, then!" said Henrique. "Dodo will lie as
fast as he can speak."
 
"You frighten him into deceiving, if you treat him so."
 
"Why, Eva, youve really taken such a fancy to Dodo, that I shall be
jealous."
 
"But you beat him,and he didnt deserve it."
 
"O, well, it may go for some time when he does, and dont get it. A few
cuts never come amiss with Dodo,hes a regular spirit, I can tell you
but I wont beat him again before you, if it troubles you."
 
Eva was not satisfied, but found it in vain to try to make her handsome
cousin understand her feelings.
 
Dodo soon appeared, with the horses.
 
"Well, Dodo, youve done pretty well, this time," said his young master,
with a more gracious air. "Come, now, and hold Miss Evas horse while I
put her on to the saddle."
 
Dodo came and stood by Evas pony. His face was troubled his eyes
looked as if he had been crying.
 
Henrique, who valued himself on his gentlemanly adroitness in all
matters of gallantry, soon had his fair cousin in the saddle, and,
gathering the reins, placed them in her hands.
 
But Eva bent to the other side of the horse, where Dodo was standing,
and said, as he relinquished the reins,"Thats a good boy,
Dodothank you!"
 
Dodo looked up in amazement into the sweet young face the blood rushed
to his cheeks, and the tears to his eyes.
 
"Here, Dodo," said his master, imperiously.
 
Dodo sprang and held the horse, while his master mounted.
 
"Theres a picayune for you to buy candy with, Dodo," said Henrique "go
get some."
 
And Henrique cantered down the walk after Eva. Dodo stood looking after
the two children. One had given him money and one had given him what he
wanted far more,a kind word, kindly spoken. Dodo had been only a
few months away from his mother. His master had bought him at a slave
warehouse, for his handsome face, to be a match to the handsome pony
and he was now getting his breaking in, at the hands of his young
master.
 
The scene of the beating had been witnessed by the two brothers St.
Clare, from another part of the garden.
 
Augustines cheek flushed but he only observed, with his usual
sarcastic carelessness.
 
"I suppose thats what we may call republican education, Alfred?"
 
"Henrique is a devil of a fellow, when his bloods up," said Alfred,
carelessly.
 
"I suppose you consider this an instructive practice for him," said
Augustine, drily.
 
"I couldnt help it, if I didnt. Henrique is a regular little
tempesthis mother and I have given him up, long ago. But, then, that
Dodo is a perfect sprite,no amount of whipping can hurt him."
 
"And this by way of teaching Henrique the first verse of a republicans
catechism, All men are born free and equal!"
 
"Poh!" said Alfred "one of Tom Jeffersons pieces of French sentiment
and humbug. Its perfectly ridiculous to have that going the rounds
among us, to this day."
 
"I think it is," said St. Clare, significantly.
 
"Because," said Alfred, "we can see plainly enough that all men are
_not_ born free, nor born equal they are born anything else. For
my part, I think half this republican talk sheer humbug. It is the
educated, the intelligent, the wealthy, the refined, who ought to have
equal rights and not the canaille."
 
"If you can keep the canaille of that opinion," said Augustine. "They
took _their_ turn once, in France."
 
"Of course, they must be _kept down_, consistently, steadily, as
I _should_," said Alfred, setting his foot hard down as if he were
standing on somebody.
 
"It makes a terrible slip when they get up," said Augustine,"in St.
Domingo, for instance."
 
"Poh!" said Alfred, "well take care of that, in this country. We must
set our face against all this educating, elevating talk, that is getting
about now the lower class must not be educated."
 
"That is past praying for," said Augustine "educated they will be, and
we have only to say how. Our system is educating them in barbarism and
brutality. We are breaking all humanizing ties, and making them brute
beasts and, if they get the upper hand, such we shall find them."
 
"They shall never get the upper hand!" said Alfred.
 
"Thats right," said St. Clare "put on the steam, fasten down the
escapevalve, and sit on it, and see where youll land."
 
"Well," said Alfred, "we _will_ see. Im not afraid to sit on the
escapevalve, as long as the boilers are strong, and the machinery works
well."
 
"The nobles in Louis XVI.s time thought just so and Austria and Pius
IX. think so now and, some pleasant morning, you may all be caught up
to meet each other in the air, _when the boilers burst_."
 
"_Dies declarabit_," said Alfred, laughing.
 
"I tell you," said Augustine, "if there is anything that is revealed
with the strength of a divine law in our times, it is that the masses
are to rise, and the under class become the upper one."
 
"Thats one of your red republican humbugs, Augustine! Why didnt you
ever take to the stumpyoud make a famous stump orator! Well, I hope
I shall be dead before this millennium of your greasy masses comes on."
 
"Greasy or not greasy, they will govern _you_, when their time comes,"
said Augustine "and they will be just such rulers as you make them. The
French noblesse chose to have the people _sans culottes_, and they
had _sans culotte_ governors to their hearts content. The people of
Hayti"
 
"O, come, Augustine! as if we hadnt had enough of that abominable,
contemptible Hayti! The Haytiens were not Anglo Saxons if they
had been there would have been another story. The Anglo Saxon is the
dominant race of the world, and _is to be so_."
 
      In August 1791, as a consequence of the French Revolution,
     the black slaves and mulattoes on Haiti rose in revolt
     against the whites, and in the period of turmoil that
     followed enormous cruelties were practised by both sides.
     The "Emperor" Dessalines, come to power in 1804, massacred
     all the whites on the island.  Haitian bloodshed became an
     argument to show the barbarous nature of the Negro, a
     doctrine Wendell Phillips sought to combat in his celebrated
     lecture on Toussaint LOuverture.
 
"Well, there is a pretty fair infusion of Anglo Saxon blood among our
slaves, now," said Augustine. "There are plenty among them who have only
enough of the African to give a sort of tropical warmth and fervor to
our calculating firmness and foresight. If ever the San Domingo hour
comes, Anglo Saxon blood will lead on the day. Sons of white fathers,
with all our haughty feelings burning in their veins, will not always
be bought and sold and traded. They will rise, and raise with them their
mothers race."
 
"Stuff!nonsense!"
 
"Well," said Augustine, "there goes an old saying to this effect, As
it was in the days of Noah so shall it bethey ate, they drank, they
planted, they builded, and knew not till the flood came and took them."
 
"On the whole, Augustine, I think your talents might do for a circuit
rider," said Alfred, laughing. "Never you fear for us possession is our
nine points. Weve got the power. This subject race," said he, stamping
firmly, "is down and shall _stay_ down! We have energy enough to manage
our own powder."
 
"Sons trained like your Henrique will be grand guardians of your
powdermagazines," said Augustine,"so cool and selfpossessed!
The proverb says, They that cannot govern themselves cannot govern
others."
 
"There is a trouble there" said Alfred, thoughtfully "theres no doubt
that our system is a difficult one to train children under. It gives too
free scope to the passions, altogether, which, in our climate, are
hot enough. I find trouble with Henrique. The boy is generous and
warmhearted, but a perfect firecracker when excited. I believe I shall
send him North for his education, where obedience is more fashionable,
and where he will associate more with equals, and less with dependents."
 
"Since training children is the staple work of the human race," said
Augustine, "I should think it something of a consideration that our
system does not work well there."
 
"It does not for some things," said Alfred "for others, again, it does.
It makes boys manly and courageous and the very vices of an abject race
tend to strengthen in them the opposite virtues. I think Henrique,
now, has a keener sense of the beauty of truth, from seeing lying and
deception the universal badge of slavery."
 
"A Christianlike view of the subject, certainly!" said Augustine.
 
"Its true, Christianlike or not and is about as Christianlike as
most other things in the world," said Alfred.
 
"That may be," said St. Clare.
 
"Well, theres no use in talking, Augustine. I believe weve been round
and round this old track five hundred times, more or less. What do you
say to a game of backgammon?"
 
The two brothers ran up the verandah steps, and were soon seated at a
light bamboo stand, with the backgammonboard between them. As they were
setting their men, Alfred said,
 
"I tell you, Augustine, if I thought as you do, I should do something."
 
"I dare say you would,you are one of the doing sort,but what?"
 
"Why, elevate your own servants, for a specimen," said Alfred, with a
halfscornful smile.
 
"You might as well set Mount Ætna on them flat, and tell them to
stand up under it, as tell me to elevate my servants under all the
superincumbent mass of society upon them. One man can do nothing,
against the whole action of a community. Education, to do anything, must
be a state education or there must be enough agreed in it to make a
current."
 
"You take the first throw," said Alfred and the brothers were soon lost
in the game, and heard no more till the scraping of horses feet was
heard under the verandah.
 
"There come the children," said Augustine, rising. "Look here, Alf! Did
you ever see anything so beautiful?" And, in truth, it _was_ a beautiful
sight. Henrique, with his bold brow, and dark, glossy curls, and glowing
cheek, was laughing gayly as he bent towards his fair cousin, as they
came on. She was dressed in a blue riding dress, with a cap of the same
color. Exercise had given a brilliant hue to her cheeks, and heightened
the effect of her singularly transparent skin, and golden hair.
 
"Good heavens! what perfectly dazzling beauty!" said Alfred. "I tell
you, Auguste, wont she make some hearts ache, one of these days?"
 
"She will, too truly,God knows Im afraid so!" said St. Clare, in a
tone of sudden bitterness, as he hurried down to take her off her horse.
 
"Eva darling! youre not much tired?" he said, as he clasped her in his
arms.
 
"No, papa," said the child but her short, hard breathing alarmed her
father.
 
"How could you ride so fast, dear?you know its bad for you."
 
"I felt so well, papa, and liked it so much, I forgot."
 
St. Clare carried her in his arms into the parlor, and laid her on the
sofa.
 
"Henrique, you must be careful of Eva," said he "you mustnt ride fast
with her."
 
"Ill take her under my care," said Henrique, seating himself by the
sofa, and taking Evas hand.
 
Eva soon found herself much better. Her father and uncle resumed their
game, and the children were left together.
 
"Do you know, Eva, Im sorry papa is only going to stay two days here,
and then I shant see you again for ever so long! If I stay with you,
Id try to be good, and not be cross to Dodo, and so on. I dont mean
to treat Dodo ill but, you know, Ive got such a quick temper. Im not
really bad to him, though. I give him a picayune, now and then and you
see he dresses well. I think, on the whole, Dodo s pretty well off."
 
"Would you think you were well off, if there were not one creature in
the world near you to love you?"
 
"I?Well, of course not."
 
"And you have taken Dodo away from all the friends he ever had, and now
he has not a creature to love himnobody can be good that way."
 
"Well, I cant help it, as I know of. I cant get his mother and I cant
love him myself, nor anybody else, as I know of."
 
"Why cant you?" said Eva.
 
"_Love_ Dodo! Why, Eva, you wouldnt have me! I may _like_ him well
enough but you dont _love_ your servants."
 
"I do, indeed."
 
"How odd!"
 
"Dont the Bible say we must love everybody?"
 
"O, the Bible! To be sure, it says a great many such things but, then,
nobody ever thinks of doing them,you know, Eva, nobody does."
 
Eva did not speak her eyes were fixed and thoughtful for a few moments.
 
"At any rate," she said, "dear Cousin, do love poor Dodo, and be kind to
him, for my sake!"
 
"I could love anything, for your sake, dear Cousin for I really think
you are the loveliest creature that I ever saw!" And Henrique spoke
with an earnestness that flushed his handsome face. Eva received it with
perfect simplicity, without even a change of feature merely saying,
"Im glad you feel so, dear Henrique! I hope you will remember."
 
The dinnerbell put an end to the interview.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXIV
 
Foreshadowings
 
 
Two days after this, Alfred St. Clare and Augustine parted and Eva, who
had been stimulated, by the society of her young cousin, to exertions
beyond her strength, began to fail rapidly. St. Clare was at last
willing to call in medical advice,a thing from which he had always
shrunk, because it was the admission of an unwelcome truth.
 
But, for a day or two, Eva was so unwell as to be confined to the house
and the doctor was called.
 
Marie St. Clare had taken no notice of the childs gradually decaying
health and strength, because she was completely absorbed in studying out
two or three new forms of disease to which she believed she herself was
a victim. It was the first principle of Maries belief that nobody ever
was or could be so great a sufferer as _herself_ and, therefore, she
always repelled quite indignantly any suggestion that any one around her
could be sick. She was always sure, in such a case, that it was nothing
but laziness, or want of energy and that, if they had had the suffering
_she_ had, they would soon know the difference.
 
Miss Ophelia had several times tried to awaken her maternal fears about
Eva but to no avail.
 
"I dont see as anything ails the child," she would say "she runs
about, and plays."
 
"But she has a cough."
 
"Cough! you dont need to tell _me_ about a cough. Ive always been
subject to a cough, all my days. When I was of Evas age, they thought
I was in a consumption. Night after night, Mammy used to sit up with me.
O! Evas cough is not anything."
 
"But she gets weak, and is shortbreathed."
 
"Law! Ive had that, years and years its only a nervous affection."
 
"But she sweats so, nights!"
 
"Well, I have, these ten years. Very often, night after night, my
clothes will be wringing wet. There wont be a dry thread in my
nightclothes and the sheets will be so that Mammy has to hang them up
to dry! Eva doesnt sweat anything like that!"
 
Miss Ophelia shut her mouth for a season. But, now that Eva was fairly
and visibly prostrated, and a doctor called, Marie, all on a sudden,
took a new turn.
 
"She knew it," she said "she always felt it, that she was destined
to be the most miserable of mothers. Here she was, with her wretched
health, and her only darling child going down to the grave before her
eyes"and Marie routed up Mammy nights, and rumpussed and scolded,
with more energy than ever, all day, on the strength of this new misery.
 
"My dear Marie, dont talk so!" said St. Clare. "You ought not to give up
the case so, at once."
 
"You have not a mothers feelings, St. Clare! You never could understand
me!you dont now."
 
"But dont talk so, as if it were a gone case!"
 
"I cant take it as indifferently as you can, St. Clare. If _you_ dont
feel when your only child is in this alarming state, I do. Its a blow
too much for me, with all I was bearing before."
 
"Its true," said St. Clare, "that Eva is very delicate, _that_ I always
knew and that she has grown so rapidly as to exhaust her strength and
that her situation is critical. But just now she is only prostrated by
the heat of the weather, and by the excitement of her cousins visit,
and the exertions she made. The physician says there is room for hope."
 
"Well, of course, if you can look on the bright side, pray do its a
mercy if people havent sensitive feelings, in this world. I am sure I
wish I didnt feel as I do it only makes me completely wretched! I wish
I _could_ be as easy as the rest of you!"
 
And the "rest of them" had good reason to breathe the same prayer, for
Marie paraded her new misery as the reason and apology for all sorts
of inflictions on every one about her. Every word that was spoken by
anybody, everything that was done or was not done everywhere, was only
a new proof that she was surrounded by hardhearted, insensible beings,
who were unmindful of her peculiar sorrows. Poor Eva heard some of these
speeches and nearly cried her little eyes out, in pity for her mamma,
and in sorrow that she should make her so much distress.
 
In a week or two, there was a great improvement of symptoms,one of
those deceitful lulls, by which her inexorable disease so often beguiles
the anxious heart, even on the verge of the grave. Evas step was again
in the garden,in the balconies she played and laughed again,and
her father, in a transport, declared that they should soon have her
as hearty as anybody. Miss Ophelia and the physician alone felt no
encouragement from this illusive truce. There was one other heart, too,
that felt the same certainty, and that was the little heart of Eva. What
is it that sometimes speaks in the soul so calmly, so clearly, that its
earthly time is short? Is it the secret instinct of decaying nature, or
the souls impulsive throb, as immortality draws on? Be it what it may,
it rested in the heart of Eva, a calm, sweet, prophetic certainty
that Heaven was near calm as the light of sunset, sweet as the bright
stillness of autumn, there her little heart reposed, only troubled by
sorrow for those who loved her so dearly.
 
For the child, though nursed so tenderly, and though life was unfolding
before her with every brightness that love and wealth could give, had no
regret for herself in dying.
 
In that book which she and her simple old friend had read so much
together, she had seen and taken to her young heart the image of one who
loved the little child and, as she gazed and mused, He had ceased to
be an image and a picture of the distant past, and come to be a living,
allsurrounding reality. His love enfolded her childish heart with more
than mortal tenderness and it was to Him, she said, she was going, and
to his home.
 
But her heart yearned with sad tenderness for all that she was to leave
behind. Her father most,for Eva, though she never distinctly thought
so, had an instinctive perception that she was more in his heart than
any other. She loved her mother because she was so loving a creature,
and all the selfishness that she had seen in her only saddened and
perplexed her for she had a childs implicit trust that her mother
could not do wrong. There was something about her that Eva never could
make out and she always smoothed it over with thinking that, after all,
it was mamma, and she loved her very dearly indeed.
 
She felt, too, for those fond, faithful servants, to whom she was as
daylight and sunshine. Children do not usually generalize but Eva was
an uncommonly mature child, and the things that she had witnessed of the
evils of the system under which they were living had fallen, one by
one, into the depths of her thoughtful, pondering heart. She had vague
longings to do something for them,to bless and save not only them,
but all in their condition,longings that contrasted sadly with the
feebleness of her little frame.
 
"Uncle Tom," she said, one day, when she was reading to her friend, "I
can understand why Jesus _wanted_ to die for us."
 
"Why, Miss Eva?"
 
"Because Ive felt so, too."
 
"What is it Miss Eva?I dont understand."
 
"I cant tell you but, when I saw those poor creatures on the boat,
you know, when you came up and I,some had lost their mothers, and some
their husbands, and some mothers cried for their little childrenand
when I heard about poor Prue,oh, wasnt that dreadful!and a great
many other times, Ive felt that I would be glad to die, if my dying
could stop all this misery. _I would_ die for them, Tom, if I could,"
said the child, earnestly, laying her little thin hand on his.
 
Tom looked at the child with awe and when she, hearing her fathers
voice, glided away, he wiped his eyes many times, as he looked after
her.
 
"Its jest no use tryin to keep Miss Eva here," he said to Mammy, whom
he met a moment after. "Shes got the Lords mark in her forehead."
 
"Ah, yes, yes," said Mammy, raising her hands "Ive allers said so.
She wasnt never like a child thats to livethere was allers something
deep in her eyes. Ive told Missis so, many the time its a comin
true,we all sees it,dear, little, blessed lamb!"
 
Eva came tripping up the verandah steps to her father. It was late in
the afternoon, and the rays of the sun formed a kind of glory behind
her, as she came forward in her white dress, with her golden hair and
glowing cheeks, her eyes unnaturally bright with the slow fever that
burned in her veins.
 
St. Clare had called her to show a statuette that he had been buying
for her but her appearance, as she came on, impressed him suddenly and
painfully. There is a kind of beauty so intense, yet so fragile, that we
cannot bear to look at it. Her father folded her suddenly in his arms,
and almost forgot what he was going to tell her.
 
"Eva, dear, you are better nowadays,are you not?"
 
"Papa," said Eva, with sudden firmness "Ive had things I wanted to say
to you, a great while. I want to say them now, before I get weaker."
 
St. Clare trembled as Eva seated herself in his lap. She laid her head
on his bosom, and said,
 
"Its all no use, papa, to keep it to myself any longer. The time is
coming that I am going to leave you. I am going, and never to come
back!" and Eva sobbed.
 
"O, now, my dear little Eva!" said St. Clare, trembling as he spoke, but
speaking cheerfully, "youve got nervous and lowspirited you mustnt
indulge such gloomy thoughts. See here, Ive bought a statuette for
you!"
 
"No, papa," said Eva, putting it gently away, "dont deceive
yourself!I am _not_ any better, I know it perfectly well,and I am
going, before long. I am not nervous,I am not lowspirited. If it were
not for you, papa, and my friends, I should be perfectly happy. I want
to go,I long to go!"
 
"Why, dear child, what has made your poor little heart so sad? You have
had everything, to make you happy, that could be given you."
 
"I had rather be in heaven though, only for my friends sake, I would
be willing to live. There are a great many things here that make me sad,
that seem dreadful to me I had rather be there but I dont want to
leave you,it almost breaks my heart!"
 
"What makes you sad, and seems dreadful, Eva?"
 
"O, things that are done, and done all the time. I feel sad for our poor
people they love me dearly, and they are all good and kind to me. I
wish, papa, they were all _free_."
 
"Why, Eva, child, dont you think they are well enough off now?"
 
"O, but, papa, if anything should happen to you, what would become of
them? There are very few men like you, papa. Uncle Alfred isnt like
you, and mamma isnt and then, think of poor old Prues owners! What
horrid things people do, and can do!" and Eva shuddered.
 
"My dear child, you are too sensitive. Im sorry I ever let you hear
such stories."
 
"O, thats what troubles me, papa. You want me to live so happy, and
never to have any pain,never suffer anything,not even hear a sad
story, when other poor creatures have nothing but pain and sorrow, all
their livesit seems selfish. I ought to know such things, I ought to
feel about them! Such things always sunk into my heart they went down
deep Ive thought and thought about them. Papa, isnt there any way to
have all slaves made free?"
 
"Thats a difficult question, dearest. Theres no doubt that this way
is a very bad one a great many people think so I do myself I heartily
wish that there were not a slave in the land but, then, I dont know
what is to be done about it!"
 
"Papa, you are such a good man, and so noble, and kind, and you always
have a way of saying things that is so pleasant, couldnt you go all
round and try to persuade people to do right about this? When I am dead,
papa, then you will think of me, and do it for my sake. I would do it,
if I could."
 
"When you are dead, Eva," said St. Clare, passionately. "O, child, dont
talk to me so! You are all I have on earth."
 
"Poor old Prues child was all that she had,and yet she had to hear it
crying, and she couldnt help it! Papa, these poor creatures love their
children as much as you do me. O! do something for them! Theres poor
Mammy loves her children Ive seen her cry when she talked about them.
And Tom loves his children and its dreadful, papa, that such things
are happening, all the time!"
 
"There, there, darling," said St. Clare, soothingly "only dont
distress yourself, dont talk of dying, and I will do anything you
wish."
 
"And promise me, dear father, that Tom shall have his freedom as soon
as"she stopped, and said, in a hesitating tone"I am gone!"
 
"Yes, dear, I will do anything in the world,anything you could ask me
to."
 
"Dear papa," said the child, laying her burning cheek against his, "how
I wish we could go together!"
 
"Where, dearest?" said St. Clare.
 
"To our Saviours home its so sweet and peaceful thereit is all so
loving there!" The child spoke unconsciously, as of a place where she
had often been. "Dont you want to go, papa?" she said.
 
St. Clare drew her closer to him, but was silent.
 
"You will come to me," said the child, speaking in a voice of calm
certainty which she often used unconsciously.
 
"I shall come after you. I shall not forget you."
 
The shadows of the solemn evening closed round them deeper and deeper,
as St. Clare sat silently holding the little frail form to his bosom.
He saw no more the deep eyes, but the voice came over him as a spirit
voice, and, as in a sort of judgment vision, his whole past life rose in
a moment before his eyes his mothers prayers and hymns his own early
yearnings and aspirings for good and, between them and this hour, years
of worldliness and scepticism, and what man calls respectable living.
We can think _much_, very much, in a moment. St. Clare saw and felt many
things, but spoke nothing and, as it grew darker, he took his child
to her bedroom and, when she was prepared for rest he sent away the
attendants, and rocked her in his arms, and sung to her till she was
asleep.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXV
 
The Little Evangelist
 
It was Sunday afternoon. St. Clare was stretched on a bamboo lounge in
the verandah, solacing himself with a cigar. Marie lay reclined on a
sofa, opposite the window opening on the verandah, closely secluded,
under an awning of transparent gauze, from the outrages of the
mosquitos, and languidly holding in her hand an elegantly bound
prayerbook. She was holding it because it was Sunday, and she imagined
she had been reading it,though, in fact, she had been only taking a
succession of short naps, with it open in her hand.
 
Miss Ophelia, who, after some rummaging, had hunted up a small Methodist
meeting within riding distance, had gone out, with Tom as driver, to
attend it and Eva had accompanied them.
 
"I say, Augustine," said Marie after dozing a while, "I must send to the
city after my old Doctor Posey Im sure Ive got the complaint of the
heart."
 
"Well why need you send for him? This doctor that attends Eva seems
skilful."
 
"I would not trust him in a critical case," said Marie "and I think
I may say mine is becoming so! Ive been thinking of it, these two
or three nights past I have such distressing pains, and such strange
feelings."
 
"O, Marie, you are blue I dont believe its heart complaint."
 
"I dare say _you_ dont," said Marie "I was prepared to expect _that_.
You can be alarmed enough, if Eva coughs, or has the least thing the
matter with her but you never think of me."
 
"If its particularly agreeable to you to have heart disease, why, Ill
try and maintain you have it," said St. Clare "I didnt know it was."
 
"Well, I only hope you wont be sorry for this, when its too late!"
said Marie "but, believe it or not, my distress about Eva, and the
exertions I have made with that dear child, have developed what I have
long suspected."
 
What the _exertions_ were which Marie referred to, it would have been
difficult to state. St. Clare quietly made this commentary to himself,
and went on smoking, like a hardhearted wretch of a man as he was,
till a carriage drove up before the verandah, and Eva and Miss Ophelia
alighted.
 
Miss Ophelia marched straight to her own chamber, to put away her bonnet
and shawl, as was always her manner, before she spoke a word on any
subject while Eva came, at St. Clares call, and was sitting on his
knee, giving him an account of the services they had heard.
 
They soon heard loud exclamations from Miss Ophelias room, which,
like the one in which they were sitting, opened on to the verandah and
violent reproof addressed to somebody.
 
"What new witchcraft has Tops been brewing?" asked St. Clare. "That
commotion is of her raising, Ill be bound!"
 
And, in a moment after, Miss Ophelia, in high indignation, came dragging
the culprit along.
 
"Come out here, now!" she said. "I _will_ tell your master!"
 
"Whats the case now?" asked Augustine.
 
"The case is, that I cannot be plagued with this child, any longer! Its
past all bearing flesh and blood cannot endure it! Here, I locked her
up, and gave her a hymn to study and what does she do, but spy
out where I put my key, and has gone to my bureau, and got a
bonnettrimming, and cut it all to pieces to make dolls jackets! I never
saw anything like it, in my life!"
 
"I told you, Cousin," said Marie, "that youd find out that these
creatures cant be brought up without severity. If I had _my_ way, now,"
she said, looking reproachfully at St. Clare, "Id send that child out,
and have her thoroughly whipped Id have her whipped till she couldnt
stand!"
 
"I dont doubt it," said St. Clare. "Tell me of the lovely rule of
woman! I never saw above a dozen women that wouldnt half kill a horse,
or a servant, either, if they had their own way with them!let alone a
man."
 
"There is no use in this shillyshally way of yours, St. Clare!" said
Marie. "Cousin is a woman of sense, and she sees it now, as plain as I
do."
 
Miss Ophelia had just the capability of indignation that belongs to the
thoroughpaced housekeeper, and this had been pretty actively roused
by the artifice and wastefulness of the child in fact, many of my
lady readers must own that they should have felt just so in her
circumstances but Maries words went beyond her, and she felt less
heat.
 
"I wouldnt have the child treated so, for the world," she said "but,
I am sure, Augustine, I dont know what to do. Ive taught and taught
Ive talked till Im tired Ive whipped her Ive punished her in every
way I can think of, and shes just what she was at first."
 
"Come here, Tops, you monkey!" said St. Clare, calling the child up to
him.
 
Topsy came up her round, hard eyes glittering and blinking with a
mixture of apprehensiveness and their usual odd drollery.
 
"What makes you behave so?" said St. Clare, who could not help being
amused with the childs expression.
 
"Spects its my wicked heart," said Topsy, demurely "Miss Feely says
so."
 
"Dont you see how much Miss Ophelia has done for you? She says she has
done everything she can think of."
 
"Lor, yes, Masr! old Missis used to say so, too. She whipped me a heap
harder, and used to pull my har, and knock my head agin the door but
it didnt do me no good! I spects, if they s to pull every spire o har
out o my head, it wouldnt do no good, neither,I s so wicked! Laws!
I s nothin but a nigger, no ways!"
 
"Well, I shall have to give her up," said Miss Ophelia "I cant have
that trouble any longer."
 
"Well, Id just like to ask one question," said St. Clare.
 
"What is it?"
 
"Why, if your Gospel is not strong enough to save one heathen child,
that you can have at home here, all to yourself, whats the use of
sending one or two poor missionaries off with it among thousands of just
such? I suppose this child is about a fair sample of what thousands of
your heathen are."
 
Miss Ophelia did not make an immediate answer and Eva, who had stood a
silent spectator of the scene thus far, made a silent sign to Topsy to
follow her. There was a little glassroom at the corner of the verandah,
which St. Clare used as a sort of readingroom and Eva and Topsy
disappeared into this place.
 
"Whats Eva going about, now?" said St. Clare "I mean to see."
 
And, advancing on tiptoe, he lifted up a curtain that covered the
glassdoor, and looked in. In a moment, laying his finger on his lips,
he made a silent gesture to Miss Ophelia to come and look. There sat the
two children on the floor, with their side faces towards them. Topsy,
with her usual air of careless drollery and unconcern but, opposite to
her, Eva, her whole face fervent with feeling, and tears in her large
eyes.
 
"What does make you so bad, Topsy? Why wont you try and be good? Dont
you love _anybody_, Topsy?"
 
"Donno nothing bout love I loves candy and sich, thats all," said
Topsy.
 
"But you love your father and mother?"
 
"Never had none, ye know. I telled ye that, Miss Eva."
 
"O, I know," said Eva, sadly "but hadnt you any brother, or sister, or
aunt, or"
 
"No, none on em,never had nothing nor nobody."
 
"But, Topsy, if youd only try to be good, you might"
 
"Couldnt never be nothin but a nigger, if I was ever so good," said
Topsy. "If I could be skinned, and come white, Id try then."
 
"But people can love you, if you are black, Topsy. Miss Ophelia would
love you, if you were good."
 
Topsy gave the short, blunt laugh that was her common mode of expressing
incredulity.
 
"Dont you think so?" said Eva.
 
"No she cant bar me, cause Im a nigger!shed s soon have a
toad touch her! There cant nobody love niggers, and niggers cant do
nothin! _I_ dont care," said Topsy, beginning to whistle.
 
"O, Topsy, poor child, _I_ love you!" said Eva, with a sudden burst of
feeling, and laying her little thin, white hand on Topsys shoulder
"I love you, because you havent had any father, or mother, or
friendsbecause youve been a poor, abused child! I love you, and I
want you to be good. I am very unwell, Topsy, and I think I shant live
a great while and it really grieves me, to have you be so naughty. I
wish you would try to be good, for my sakeits only a little while I
shall be with you."
 
The round, keen eyes of the black child were overcast with
tearslarge, bright drops rolled heavily down, one by one, and fell on
the little white hand. Yes, in that moment, a ray of real belief, a ray
of heavenly love, had penetrated the darkness of her heathen soul! She
laid her head down between her knees, and wept and sobbed,while the
beautiful child, bending over her, looked like the picture of some
bright angel stooping to reclaim a sinner.
 
"Poor Topsy!" said Eva, "dont you know that Jesus loves all alike? He
is just as willing to love you, as me. He loves you just as I do,only
more, because he is better. He will help you to be good and you can go
to Heaven at last, and be an angel forever, just as much as if you
were white. Only think of it, Topsy!_you_ can be one of those spirits
bright, Uncle Tom sings about."
 
"O, dear Miss Eva, dear Miss Eva!" said the child "I will try, I will
try I never did care nothin about it before."
 
St. Clare, at this instant, dropped the curtain. "It puts me in mind of
mother," he said to Miss Ophelia. "It is true what she told me if we
want to give sight to the blind, we must be willing to do as Christ
did,call them to us, and _put our hands on them_."
 
"Ive always had a prejudice against negroes," said Miss Ophelia, "and
its a fact, I never could bear to have that child touch me but, I
dont think she knew it."
 
"Trust any child to find that out," said St. Clare "theres no keeping
it from them. But I believe that all the trying in the world to benefit
a child, and all the substantial favors you can do them, will never
excite one emotion of gratitude, while that feeling of repugnance
remains in the heartits a queer kind of a fact,but so it is."
 
"I dont know how I can help it," said Miss Ophelia "they _are_
disagreeable to me,this child in particular,how can I help feeling
so?"
 
"Eva does, it seems."
 
"Well, shes so loving! After all, though, shes no more than
Christlike," said Miss Ophelia "I wish I were like her. She might
teach me a lesson."
 
"It wouldnt be the first time a little child had been used to instruct
an old disciple, if it _were_ so," said St. Clare.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXVI
 
Death
 
     Weep not for those whom the veil of the tomb,
     In lifes early morning, hath hid from our eyes.
 
 
      "Weep Not for Those," a poem by Thomas Moore 17791852.
 
Evas bedroom was a spacious apartment, which, like all the other
rooms in the house, opened on to the broad verandah. The room
communicated, on one side, with her father and mothers apartment
on the other, with that appropriated to Miss Ophelia. St. Clare had
gratified his own eye and taste, in furnishing this room in a style
that had a peculiar keeping with the character of her for whom it was
intended. The windows were hung with curtains of rosecolored and white
muslin, the floor was spread with a matting which had been ordered
in Paris, to a pattern of his own device, having round it a border of
rosebuds and leaves, and a centrepiece with fullflown roses. The
bedstead, chairs, and lounges, were of bamboo, wrought in peculiarly
graceful and fanciful patterns. Over the head of the bed was an
alabaster bracket, on which a beautiful sculptured angel stood,
with drooping wings, holding out a crown of myrtleleaves. From this
depended, over the bed, light curtains of rosecolored gauze, striped
with silver, supplying that protection from mosquitos which is an
indispensable addition to all sleeping accommodation in that climate.
The graceful bamboo lounges were amply supplied with cushions of
rosecolored damask, while over them, depending from the hands of
sculptured figures, were gauze curtains similar to those of the bed. A
light, fanciful bamboo table stood in the middle of the room, where a
Parian vase, wrought in the shape of a white lily, with its buds, stood,
ever filled with flowers. On this table lay Evas books and little
trinkets, with an elegantly wrought alabaster writingstand, which her
father had supplied to her when he saw her trying to improve herself
in writing. There was a fireplace in the room, and on the marble mantle
above stood a beautifully wrought statuette of Jesus receiving little
children, and on either side marble vases, for which it was Toms pride
and delight to offer bouquets every morning. Two or three exquisite
paintings of children, in various attitudes, embellished the wall. In
short, the eye could turn nowhere without meeting images of childhood,
of beauty, and of peace. Those little eyes never opened, in the morning
light, without falling on something which suggested to the heart
soothing and beautiful thoughts.
 
The deceitful strength which had buoyed Eva up for a little while was
fast passing away seldom and more seldom her light footstep was heard
in the verandah, and oftener and oftener she was found reclined on a
little lounge by the open window, her large, deep eyes fixed on the
rising and falling waters of the lake.
 
It was towards the middle of the afternoon, as she was so
reclining,her Bible half open, her little transparent fingers lying
listlessly between the leaves,suddenly she heard her mothers voice,
in sharp tones, in the verandah.
 
"What now, you baggage!what new piece of mischief! Youve been picking
the flowers, hey?" and Eva heard the sound of a smart slap.
 
"Law, Missis! they s for Miss Eva," she heard a voice say, which she
knew belonged to Topsy.
 
"Miss Eva! A pretty excuse!you suppose she wants _your_ flowers, you
goodfornothing nigger! Get along off with you!"
 
In a moment, Eva was off from her lounge, and in the verandah.
 
"O, dont, mother! I should like the flowers do give them to me I want
them!"
 
"Why, Eva, your room is full now."
 
"I cant have too many," said Eva. "Topsy, do bring them here."
 
Topsy, who had stood sullenly, holding down her head, now came up
and offered her flowers. She did it with a look of hesitation and
bashfulness, quite unlike the eldrich boldness and brightness which was
usual with her.
 
"Its a beautiful bouquet!" said Eva, looking at it.
 
It was rather a singular one,a brilliant scarlet geranium, and one
single white japonica, with its glossy leaves. It was tied up with an
evident eye to the contrast of color, and the arrangement of every leaf
had carefully been studied.
 
Topsy looked pleased, as Eva said,"Topsy, you arrange flowers very
prettily. Here," she said, "is this vase I havent any flowers for. I
wish youd arrange something every day for it."
 
"Well, thats odd!" said Marie. "What in the world do you want that
for?"
 
"Never mind, mamma youd as lief as not Topsy should do it,had you
not?"
 
"Of course, anything you please, dear! Topsy, you hear your young
mistresssee that you mind."
 
Topsy made a short courtesy, and looked down and, as she turned away,
Eva saw a tear roll down her dark cheek.
 
"You see, mamma, I knew poor Topsy wanted to do something for me," said
Eva to her mother.
 
"O, nonsense! its only because she likes to do mischief. She knows she
mustnt pick flowers,so she does it thats all there is to it. But,
if you fancy to have her pluck them, so be it."
 
"Mamma, I think Topsy is different from what she used to be shes
trying to be a good girl."
 
"Shell have to try a good while before _she_ gets to be good," said
Marie, with a careless laugh.
 
"Well, you know, mamma, poor Topsy! everything has always been against
her."
 
"Not since shes been here, Im sure. If she hasnt been talked to, and
preached to, and every earthly thing done that anybody could doand
shes just so ugly, and always will be you cant make anything of the
creature!"
 
"But, mamma, its so different to be brought up as Ive been, with
so many friends, so many things to make me good and happy and to be
brought up as shes been, all the time, till she came here!"
 
"Most likely," said Marie, yawning,"dear me, how hot it is!"
 
"Mamma, you believe, dont you, that Topsy could become an angel, as
well as any of us, if she were a Christian?"
 
"Topsy! what a ridiculous idea! Nobody but you would ever think of it. I
suppose she could, though."
 
"But, mamma, isnt God her father, as much as ours? Isnt Jesus her
Saviour?"
 
"Well, that may be. I suppose God made everybody," said Marie. "Where is
my smellingbottle?"
 
"Its such a pity,oh! _such_ a pity!" said Eva, looking out on the
distant lake, and speaking half to herself.
 
"Whats a pity?" said Marie.
 
"Why, that any one, who could be a bright angel, and live with angels,
should go all down, down down, and nobody help them!oh dear!"
 
"Well, we cant help it its no use worrying, Eva! I dont know whats
to be done we ought to be thankful for our own advantages."
 
"I hardly can be," said Eva, "Im so sorry to think of poor folks that
havent any."
 
"Thats odd enough," said Marie"Im sure my religion makes me
thankful for my advantages."
 
"Mamma," said Eva, "I want to have some of my hair cut off,a good deal
of it."
 
"What for?" said Marie.
 
"Mamma, I want to give some away to my friends, while I am able to give
it to them myself. Wont you ask aunty to come and cut it for me?"
 
Marie raised her voice, and called Miss Ophelia, from the other room.
 
The child half rose from her pillow as she came in, and, shaking down
her long goldenbrown curls, said, rather playfully, "Come aunty, shear
the sheep!"
 
"Whats that?" said St. Clare, who just then entered with some fruit he
had been out to get for her.
 
"Papa, I just want aunty to cut off some of my hairtheres too much
of it, and it makes my head hot. Besides, I want to give some of it
away."
 
Miss Ophelia came, with her scissors.
 
"Take care,dont spoil the looks of it!" said her father "cut
underneath, where it wont show. Evas curls are my pride."
 
"O, papa!" said Eva, sadly.
 
"Yes, and I want them kept handsome against the time I take you up to
your uncles plantation, to see Cousin Henrique," said St. Clare, in a
gay tone.
 
"I shall never go there, papaI am going to a better country. O, do
believe me! Dont you see, papa, that I get weaker, every day?"
 
"Why do you insist that I shall believe such a cruel thing, Eva?" said
her father.
 
"Only because it is _true_, papa and, if you will believe it now,
perhaps you will get to feel about it as I do."
 
St. Clare closed his lips, and stood gloomily eying the long, beautiful
curls, which, as they were separated from the childs head, were laid,
one by one, in her lap. She raised them up, looked earnestly at them,
twined them around her thin fingers, and looked from time to time,
anxiously at her father.
 
"Its just what Ive been foreboding!" said Marie "its just what has
been preying on my health, from day to day, bringing me downward to the
grave, though nobody regards it. I have seen this, long. St. Clare, you
will see, after a while, that I was right."
 
"Which will afford you great consolation, no doubt!" said St. Clare, in
a dry, bitter tone.
 
Marie lay back on a lounge, and covered her face with her cambric
handkerchief.
 
Evas clear blue eye looked earnestly from one to the other. It was the
calm, comprehending gaze of a soul half loosed from its earthly bonds
it was evident she saw, felt, and appreciated, the difference between
the two.
 
She beckoned with her hand to her father. He came and sat down by her.
 
"Papa, my strength fades away every day, and I know I must go. There are
some things I want to say and do,that I ought to do and you are so
unwilling to have me speak a word on this subject. But it must come
theres no putting it off. Do be willing I should speak now!"
 
"My child, I _am_ willing!" said St. Clare, covering his eyes with one
hand, and holding up Evas hand with the other.
 
"Then, I want to see all our people together. I have some things I
_must_ say to them," said Eva.
 
"_Well_," said St. Clare, in a tone of dry endurance.
 
Miss Ophelia despatched a messenger, and soon the whole of the servants
were convened in the room.
 
Eva lay back on her pillows her hair hanging loosely about her face,
her crimson cheeks contrasting painfully with the intense whiteness of
her complexion and the thin contour of her limbs and features, and her
large, soullike eyes fixed earnestly on every one.
 
The servants were struck with a sudden emotion. The spiritual face, the
long locks of hair cut off and lying by her, her fathers averted face,
and Maries sobs, struck at once upon the feelings of a sensitive and
impressible race and, as they came in, they looked one on another,
sighed, and shook their heads. There was a deep silence, like that of a
funeral.
 
Eva raised herself, and looked long and earnestly round at every one.
All looked sad and apprehensive. Many of the women hid their faces in
their aprons.
 
"I sent for you all, my dear friends," said Eva, "because I love you.
I love you all and I have something to say to you, which I want you
always to remember. . . . I am going to leave you. In a few more weeks
you will see me no more"
 
Here the child was interrupted by bursts of groans, sobs, and
lamentations, which broke from all present, and in which her slender
voice was lost entirely. She waited a moment, and then, speaking in a
tone that checked the sobs of all, she said,
 
"If you love me, you must not interrupt me so. Listen to what I say. I
want to speak to you about your souls. . . . Many of you, I am afraid,
are very careless. You are thinking only about this world. I want you
to remember that there is a beautiful world, where Jesus is. I am going
there, and you can go there. It is for you, as much as me. But, if you
want to go there, you must not live idle, careless, thoughtless lives.
You must be Christians. You must remember that each one of you
can become angels, and be angels forever. . . . If you want to be
Christians, Jesus will help you. You must pray to him you must read"
 
The child checked herself, looked piteously at them, and said,
sorrowfully,
 
"O dear! you _cant_ readpoor souls!" and she hid her face in the
pillow and sobbed, while many a smothered sob from those she was
addressing, who were kneeling on the floor, aroused her.
 
"Never mind," she said, raising her face and smiling brightly through
her tears, "I have prayed for you and I know Jesus will help you, even
if you cant read. Try all to do the best you can pray every day ask
Him to help you, and get the Bible read to you whenever you can and I
think I shall see you all in heaven."
 
"Amen," was the murmured response from the lips of Tom and Mammy,
and some of the elder ones, who belonged to the Methodist church. The
younger and more thoughtless ones, for the time completely overcome,
were sobbing, with their heads bowed upon their knees.
 
"I know," said Eva, "you all love me."
 
"Yes oh, yes! indeed we do! Lord bless her!" was the involuntary answer
of all.
 
"Yes, I know you do! There isnt one of you that hasnt always been very
kind to me and I want to give you something that, when you look at,
you shall always remember me, Im going to give all of you a curl of my
hair and, when you look at it, think that I loved you and am gone to
heaven, and that I want to see you all there."
 
It is impossible to describe the scene, as, with tears and sobs, they
gathered round the little creature, and took from her hands what seemed
to them a last mark of her love. They fell on their knees they sobbed,
and prayed, and kissed the hem of her garment and the elder ones poured
forth words of endearment, mingled in prayers and blessings, after the
manner of their susceptible race.
 
As each one took their gift, Miss Ophelia, who was apprehensive for the
effect of all this excitement on her little patient, signed to each one
to pass out of the apartment.
 
At last, all were gone but Tom and Mammy.
 
"Here, Uncle Tom," said Eva, "is a beautiful one for you. O, I am so
happy, Uncle Tom, to think I shall see you in heaven,for Im sure I
shall and Mammy,dear, good, kind Mammy!" she said, fondly throwing
her arms round her old nurse,"I know youll be there, too."
 
"O, Miss Eva, dont see how I can live without ye, no how!" said the
faithful creature. "Pears like its just taking everything off the
place to oncet!" and Mammy gave way to a passion of grief.
 
Miss Ophelia pushed her and Tom gently from the apartment, and thought
they were all gone but, as she turned, Topsy was standing there.
 
"Where did you start up from?" she said, suddenly.
 
"I was here," said Topsy, wiping the tears from her eyes. "O, Miss Eva,
Ive been a bad girl but wont you give _me_ one, too?"
 
"Yes, poor Topsy! to be sure, I will. Thereevery time you look at
that, think that I love you, and wanted you to be a good girl!"
 
"O, Miss Eva, I _is_ tryin!" said Topsy, earnestly "but, Lor, its so
hard to be good! Pears like I ant used to it, no ways!"
 
"Jesus knows it, Topsy he is sorry for you he will help you."
 
Topsy, with her eyes hid in her apron, was silently passed from the
apartment by Miss Ophelia but, as she went, she hid the precious curl
in her bosom.
 
All being gone, Miss Ophelia shut the door. That worthy lady had wiped
away many tears of her own, during the scene but concern for the
consequence of such an excitement to her young charge was uppermost in
her mind.
 
St. Clare had been sitting, during the whole time, with his hand shading
his eyes, in the same attitude.
 
When they were all gone, he sat so still.
 
"Papa!" said Eva, gently, laying her hand on his.
 
He gave a sudden start and shiver but made no answer.
 
"Dear papa!" said Eva.
 
"_I cannot_," said St. Clare, rising, "I _cannot_ have it so! The
Almighty hath dealt _very bitterly_ with me!" and St. Clare pronounced
these words with a bitter emphasis, indeed.
 
"Augustine! has not God a right to do what he will with his own?" said
Miss Ophelia.
 
"Perhaps so but that doesnt make it any easier to bear," said he, with
a dry, hard, tearless manner, as he turned away.
 
"Papa, you break my heart!" said Eva, rising and throwing herself into
his arms "you must not feel so!" and the child sobbed and wept with
a violence which alarmed them all, and turned her fathers thoughts at
once to another channel.
 
"There, Eva,there, dearest! Hush! hush! I was wrong I was wicked. I
will feel any way, do any way,only dont distress yourself dont sob
so. I will be resigned I was wicked to speak as I did."
 
Eva soon lay like a wearied dove in her fathers arms and he, bending
over her, soothed her by every tender word he could think of.
 
Marie rose and threw herself out of the apartment into her own, when she
fell into violent hysterics.
 
"You didnt give me a curl, Eva," said her father, smiling sadly.
 
"They are all yours, papa," said she, smiling"yours and mammas and
you must give dear aunty as many as she wants. I only gave them to our
poor people myself, because you know, papa, they might be forgotten when
I am gone, and because I hoped it might help them remember. . . . You
are a Christian, are you not, papa?" said Eva, doubtfully.
 
"Why do you ask me?"
 
"I dont know. You are so good, I dont see how you can help it."
 
"What is being a Christian, Eva?"
 
"Loving Christ most of all," said Eva.
 
"Do you, Eva?"
 
"Certainly I do."
 
"You never saw him," said St. Clare.
 
"That makes no difference," said Eva. "I believe him, and in a few days
I shall _see_ him" and the young face grew fervent, radiant with joy.
 
St. Clare said no more. It was a feeling which he had seen before in his
mother but no chord within vibrated to it.
 
Eva, after this, declined rapidly there was no more any doubt of the
event the fondest hope could not be blinded. Her beautiful room was
avowedly a sick room and Miss Ophelia day and night performed the
duties of a nurse,and never did her friends appreciate her value more
than in that capacity. With so welltrained a hand and eye, such perfect
adroitness and practice in every art which could promote neatness
and comfort, and keep out of sight every disagreeable incident of
sickness,with such a perfect sense of time, such a clear, untroubled
head, such exact accuracy in remembering every prescription and
direction of the doctors,she was everything to him. They who had
shrugged their shoulders at her little peculiarities and setnesses, so
unlike the careless freedom of southern manners, acknowledged that now
she was the exact person that was wanted.
 
Uncle Tom was much in Evas room. The child suffered much from nervous
restlessness, and it was a relief to her to be carried and it was Toms
greatest delight to carry her little frail form in his arms, resting on
a pillow, now up and down her room, now out into the verandah and when
the fresh seabreezes blew from the lake,and the child felt freshest
in the morning,he would sometimes walk with her under the orangetrees
in the garden, or, sitting down in some of their old seats, sing to her
their favorite old hymns.
 
Her father often did the same thing but his frame was slighter, and
when he was weary, Eva would say to him,
 
"O, papa, let Tom take me. Poor fellow! it pleases him and you know
its all he can do now, and he wants to do something!"
 
"So do I, Eva!" said her father.
 
"Well, papa, you can do everything, and are everything to me. You read
to me,you sit up nights,and Tom has only this one thing, and his
singing and I know, too, he does it easier than you can. He carries me
so strong!"
 
The desire to do something was not confined to Tom. Every servant in the
establishment showed the same feeling, and in their way did what they
could.
 
Poor Mammys heart yearned towards her darling but she found no
opportunity, night or day, as Marie declared that the state of her mind
was such, it was impossible for her to rest and, of course, it was
against her principles to let any one else rest. Twenty times in a
night, Mammy would be roused to rub her feet, to bathe her head, to find
her pockethandkerchief, to see what the noise was in Evas room, to let
down a curtain because it was too light, or to put it up because it was
too dark and, in the daytime, when she longed to have some share in the
nursing of her pet, Marie seemed unusually ingenious in keeping her busy
anywhere and everywhere all over the house, or about her own person so
that stolen interviews and momentary glimpses were all she could obtain.
 
"I feel it my duty to be particularly careful of myself, now," she would
say, "feeble as I am, and with the whole care and nursing of that dear
child upon me."
 
"Indeed, my dear," said St. Clare, "I thought our cousin relieved you of
that."
 
"You talk like a man, St. Clare,just as if a mother _could_ be
relieved of the care of a child in that state but, then, its all
alike,no one ever knows what I feel! I cant throw things off, as you
do."
 
St. Clare smiled. You must excuse him, he couldnt help it,for St.
Clare could smile yet. For so bright and placid was the farewell voyage
of the little spirit,by such sweet and fragrant breezes was the small
bark borne towards the heavenly shores,that it was impossible to
realize that it was death that was approaching. The child felt no
pain,only a tranquil, soft weakness, daily and almost insensibly
increasing and she was so beautiful, so loving, so trustful, so
happy, that one could not resist the soothing influence of that air of
innocence and peace which seemed to breathe around her. St. Clare found
a strange calm coming over him. It was not hope,that was impossible
it was not resignation it was only a calm resting in the present, which
seemed so beautiful that he wished to think of no future. It was like
that hush of spirit which we feel amid the bright, mild woods of autumn,
when the bright hectic flush is on the trees, and the last lingering
flowers by the brook and we joy in it all the more, because we know
that soon it will all pass away.
 
The friend who knew most of Evas own imaginings and foreshadowings was
her faithful bearer, Tom. To him she said what she would not disturb her
father by saying. To him she imparted those mysterious intimations which
the soul feels, as the cords begin to unbind, ere it leaves its clay
forever.
 
Tom, at last, would not sleep in his room, but lay all night in the
outer verandah, ready to rouse at every call.
 
"Uncle Tom, what alive have you taken to sleeping anywhere and
everywhere, like a dog, for?" said Miss Ophelia. "I thought you was one
of the orderly sort, that liked to lie in bed in a Christian way."
 
"I do, Miss Feely," said Tom, mysteriously. "I do, but now"
 
"Well, what now?"
 
"We mustnt speak loud Masr St. Clare wont hear on t but Miss
Feely, you know there must be somebody watchin for the bridegroom."
 
"What do you mean, Tom?"
 
"You know it says in Scripture, At midnight there was a great cry
made. Behold, the bridegroom cometh. Thats what Im spectin now, every
night, Miss Feely,and I couldnt sleep out o hearin, no ways."
 
"Why, Uncle Tom, what makes you think so?"
 
"Miss Eva, she talks to me. The Lord, he sends his messenger in the
soul. I must be thar, Miss Feely for when that ar blessed child goes
into the kingdom, theyll open the door so wide, well all get a look in
at the glory, Miss Feely."
 
"Uncle Tom, did Miss Eva say she felt more unwell than usual tonight?"
 
"No but she telled me, this morning, she was coming nearer,thars
them that tells it to the child, Miss Feely. Its the angels,its
the trumpet sound afore the break o day," said Tom, quoting from a
favorite hymn.
 
This dialogue passed between Miss Ophelia and Tom, between ten and
eleven, one evening, after her arrangements had all been made for the
night, when, on going to bolt her outer door, she found Tom stretched
along by it, in the outer verandah.
 
She was not nervous or impressible but the solemn, heartfelt manner
struck her. Eva had been unusually bright and cheerful, that afternoon,
and had sat raised in her bed, and looked over all her little trinkets
and precious things, and designated the friends to whom she would
have them given and her manner was more animated, and her voice more
natural, than they had known it for weeks. Her father had been in, in
the evening, and had said that Eva appeared more like her former self
than ever she had done since her sickness and when he kissed her for
the night, he said to Miss Ophelia,"Cousin, we may keep her with us,
after all she is certainly better" and he had retired with a lighter
heart in his bosom than he had had there for weeks.
 
But at midnight,strange, mystic hour!when the veil between the frail
present and the eternal future grows thin,then came the messenger!
 
There was a sound in that chamber, first of one who stepped quickly. It
was Miss Ophelia, who had resolved to sit up all night with her
little charge, and who, at the turn of the night, had discerned what
experienced nurses significantly call "a change." The outer door was
quickly opened, and Tom, who was watching outside, was on the alert, in
a moment.
 
"Go for the doctor, Tom! lose not a moment," said Miss Ophelia and,
stepping across the room, she rapped at St. Clares door.
 
"Cousin," she said, "I wish you would come."
 
Those words fell on his heart like clods upon a coffin. Why did they?
He was up and in the room in an instant, and bending over Eva, who still
slept.
 
What was it he saw that made his heart stand still? Why was no word
spoken between the two? Thou canst say, who hast seen that same
expression on the face dearest to theethat look indescribable,
hopeless, unmistakable, that says to thee that thy beloved is no longer
thine.
 
On the face of the child, however, there was no ghastly imprint,only
a high and almost sublime expression,the overshadowing presence of
spiritual natures, the dawning of immortal life in that childish soul.
 
They stood there so still, gazing upon her, that even the ticking of the
watch seemed too loud. In a few moments, Tom returned, with the doctor.
He entered, gave one look, and stood silent as the rest.
 
"When did this change take place?" said he, in a low whisper, to Miss
Ophelia.
 
"About the turn of the night," was the reply.
 
Marie, roused by the entrance of the doctor, appeared, hurriedly, from
the next room.
 
"Augustine! Cousin!O!what!" she hurriedly began.
 
"Hush!" said St. Clare, hoarsely _"she is dying!"_
 
Mammy heard the words, and flew to awaken the servants. The house was
soon roused,lights were seen, footsteps heard, anxious faces thronged
the verandah, and looked tearfully through the glass doors but St.
Clare heard and said nothing,he saw only _that look_ on the face of
the little sleeper.
 
"O, if she would only wake, and speak once more!" he said and, stooping
over her, he spoke in her ear,"Eva, darling!"
 
The large blue eyes uncloseda smile passed over her faceshe tried
to raise her head, and to speak.
 
"Do you know me, Eva?"
 
"Dear papa," said the child, with a last effort, throwing her arms about
his neck. In a moment they dropped again and, as St. Clare raised his
head, he saw a spasm of mortal agony pass over the face,she struggled
for breath, and threw up her little hands.
 
"O, God, this is dreadful!" he said, turning away in agony, and wringing
Toms hand, scarce conscious what he was doing. "O, Tom, my boy, it is
killing me!"
 
Tom had his masters hands between his own and, with tears streaming
down his dark cheeks, looked up for help where he had always been used
to look.
 
"Pray that this may be cut short!" said St. Clare,"this wrings my
heart."
 
"O, bless the Lord! its over,its over, dear Master!" said Tom "look
at her."
 
The child lay panting on her pillows, as one exhausted,the large clear
eyes rolled up and fixed. Ah, what said those eyes, that spoke so
much of heaven! Earth was past,and earthly pain but so solemn, so
mysterious, was the triumphant brightness of that face, that it
checked even the sobs of sorrow. They pressed around her, in breathless
stillness.
 
"Eva," said St. Clare, gently.
 
She did not hear.
 
"O, Eva, tell us what you see! What is it?" said her father.
 
A bright, a glorious smile passed over her face, and she said,
brokenly,"O! love,joy,peace!" gave one sigh and passed from death
unto life!
 
"Farewell, beloved child! the bright, eternal doors have closed after
thee we shall see thy sweet face no more. O, woe for them who watched
thy entrance into heaven, when they shall wake and find only the cold
gray sky of daily life, and thou gone forever!"
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXVII
 
"This Is the Last of Earth"
 
       "This is the last of Earth!  I am content," last words of
     John Quincy Adams, uttered February 21, 1848.
 
The statuettes and pictures in Evas room were shrouded in white
napkins, and only hushed breathings and muffled footfalls were heard
there, and the light stole in solemnly through windows partially
darkened by closed blinds.
 
The bed was draped in white and there, beneath the drooping
angelfigure, lay a little sleeping form,sleeping never to waken!
 
There she lay, robed in one of the simple white dresses she had been
wont to wear when living the rosecolored light through the curtains
cast over the icy coldness of death a warm glow. The heavy eyelashes
drooped softly on the pure cheek the head was turned a little to
one side, as if in natural sleep, but there was diffused over every
lineament of the face that high celestial expression, that mingling of
rapture and repose, which showed it was no earthly or temporary sleep,
but the long, sacred rest which "He giveth to his beloved."
 
There is no death to such as thou, dear Eva! neither darkness nor shadow
of death only such a bright fading as when the morning star fades in
the golden dawn. Thine is the victory without the battle,the crown
without the conflict.
 
So did St. Clare think, as, with folded arms, he stood there gazing.
Ah! who shall say what he did think? for, from the hour that voices
had said, in the dying chamber, "she is gone," it had been all a dreary
mist, a heavy "dimness of anguish." He had heard voices around him he
had had questions asked, and answered them they had asked him when
he would have the funeral, and where they should lay her and he had
answered, impatiently, that he cared not.
 
Adolph and Rosa had arranged the chamber volatile, fickle and childish,
as they generally were, they were softhearted and full of feeling
and, while Miss Ophelia presided over the general details of order and
neatness, it was their hands that added those soft, poetic touches to
the arrangements, that took from the deathroom the grim and ghastly air
which too often marks a New England funeral.
 
There were still flowers on the shelves,all white, delicate and
fragrant, with graceful, drooping leaves. Evas little table, covered
with white, bore on it her favorite vase, with a single white moss
rosebud in it. The folds of the drapery, the fall of the curtains, had
been arranged and rearranged, by Adolph and Rosa, with that nicety of
eye which characterizes their race. Even now, while St. Clare stood
there thinking, little Rosa tripped softly into the chamber with a
basket of white flowers. She stepped back when she saw St. Clare, and
stopped respectfully but, seeing that he did not observe her, she came
forward to place them around the dead. St. Clare saw her as in a dream,
while she placed in the small hands a fair cape jessamine, and, with
admirable taste, disposed other flowers around the couch.
 
The door opened again, and Topsy, her eyes swelled with crying,
appeared, holding something under her apron. Rosa made a quick
forbidding gesture but she took a step into the room.
 
"You must go out," said Rosa, in a sharp, positive whisper "_you_
havent any business here!"
 
"O, do let me! I brought a flower,such a pretty one!" said Topsy,
holding up a halfblown tea rosebud. "Do let me put just one there."
 
"Get along!" said Rosa, more decidedly.
 
"Let her stay!" said St. Clare, suddenly stamping his foot. "She shall
come."
 
Rosa suddenly retreated, and Topsy came forward and laid her offering at
the feet of the corpse then suddenly, with a wild and bitter cry,
she threw herself on the floor alongside the bed, and wept, and moaned
aloud.
 
Miss Ophelia hastened into the room, and tried to raise and silence her
but in vain.
 
"O, Miss Eva! oh, Miss Eva! I wish I s dead, too,I do!"
 
There was a piercing wildness in the cry the blood flushed into St.
Clares white, marblelike face, and the first tears he had shed since
Eva died stood in his eyes.
 
"Get up, child," said Miss Ophelia, in a softened voice "dont cry so.
Miss Eva is gone to heaven she is an angel."
 
"But I cant see her!" said Topsy. "I never shall see her!" and she
sobbed again.
 
They all stood a moment in silence.
 
"_She_ said she _loved_ me," said Topsy,"she did! O, dear! oh, dear!
there ant _nobody_ left now,there ant!"
 
"Thats true enough" said St. Clare "but do," he said to Miss Ophelia,
"see if you cant comfort the poor creature."
 
"I jist wish I hadnt never been born," said Topsy. "I didnt want to be
born, no ways and I dont see no use on t."
 
Miss Ophelia raised her gently, but firmly, and took her from the room
but, as she did so, some tears fell from her eyes.
 
"Topsy, you poor child," she said, as she led her into her room, "dont
give up! _I_ can love you, though I am not like that dear little child.
I hope Ive learnt something of the love of Christ from her. I can love
you I do, and Ill try to help you to grow up a good Christian girl."
 
Miss Ophelias voice was more than her words, and more than that were
the honest tears that fell down her face. From that hour, she acquired
an influence over the mind of the destitute child that she never lost.
 
"O, my Eva, whose little hour on earth did so much of good," thought St.
Clare, "what account have I to give for my long years?"
 
There were, for a while, soft whisperings and footfalls in the chamber,
as one after another stole in, to look at the dead and then came the
little coffin and then there was a funeral, and carriages drove to the
door, and strangers came and were seated and there were white scarfs
and ribbons, and crape bands, and mourners dressed in black crape and
there were words read from the Bible, and prayers offered and St. Clare
lived, and walked, and moved, as one who has shed every tearto the
last he saw only one thing, that golden head in the coffin but then
he saw the cloth spread over it, the lid of the coffin closed and he
walked, when he was put beside the others, down to a little place at the
bottom of the garden, and there, by the mossy seat where she and Tom
had talked, and sung, and read so often, was the little grave. St. Clare
stood beside it,looked vacantly down he saw them lower the little
coffin he heard, dimly, the solemn words, "I am the resurrection and
the Life he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he
live" and, as the earth was cast in and filled up the little grave,
he could not realize that it was his Eva that they were hiding from his
sight.
 
Nor was it!not Eva, but only the frail seed of that bright, immortal
form with which she shall yet come forth, in the day of the Lord Jesus!
 
And then all were gone, and the mourners went back to the place which
should know her no more and Maries room was darkened, and she lay on
the bed, sobbing and moaning in uncontrollable grief, and calling every
moment for the attentions of all her servants. Of course, they had no
time to cry,why should they? the grief was _her_ grief, and she was
fully convinced that nobody on earth did, could, or would feel it as she
did.
 
"St. Clare did not shed a tear," she said "he didnt sympathize with
her it was perfectly wonderful to think how hardhearted and unfeeling
he was, when he must know how she suffered."
 
So much are people the slave of their eye and ear, that many of the
servants really thought that Missis was the principal sufferer in the
case, especially as Marie began to have hysterical spasms, and sent for
the doctor, and at last declared herself dying and, in the running and
scampering, and bringing up hot bottles, and heating of flannels, and
chafing, and fussing, that ensued, there was quite a diversion.
 
Tom, however, had a feeling at his own heart, that drew him to his
master. He followed him wherever he walked, wistfully and sadly and
when he saw him sitting, so pale and quiet, in Evas room, holding
before his eyes her little open Bible, though seeing no letter or word
of what was in it, there was more sorrow to Tom in that still, fixed,
tearless eye, than in all Maries moans and lamentations.
 
In a few days the St. Clare family were back again in the city
Augustine, with the restlessness of grief, longing for another scene, to
change the current of his thoughts. So they left the house and garden,
with its little grave, and came back to New Orleans and St. Clare
walked the streets busily, and strove to fill up the chasm in his heart
with hurry and bustle, and change of place and people who saw him in
the street, or met him at the cafe, knew of his loss only by the weed
on his hat for there he was, smiling and talking, and reading the
newspaper, and speculating on politics, and attending to business
matters and who could see that all this smiling outside was but a
hollowed shell over a heart that was a dark and silent sepulchre?
 
"Mr. St. Clare is a singular man," said Marie to Miss Ophelia, in a
complaining tone. "I used to think, if there was anything in the world
he did love, it was our dear little Eva but he seems to be forgetting
her very easily. I cannot ever get him to talk about her. I really did
think he would show more feeling!"
 
"Still waters run deepest, they used to tell me," said Miss Ophelia,
oracularly.
 
"O, I dont believe in such things its all talk. If people have
feeling, they will show it,they cant help it but, then, its a great
misfortune to have feeling. Id rather have been made like St. Clare. My
feelings prey upon me so!"
 
"Sure, Missis, Masr St. Clare is gettin thin as a shader. They say, he
dont never eat nothin," said Mammy. "I know he dont forget Miss Eva
I know there couldnt nobody,dear, little, blessed cretur!" she added,
wiping her eyes.
 
"Well, at all events, he has no consideration for me," said Marie "he
hasnt spoken one word of sympathy, and he must know how much more a
mother feels than any man can."
 
"The heart knoweth its own bitterness," said Miss Ophelia, gravely.
 
"Thats just what I think. I know just what I feel,nobody else seems
to. Eva used to, but she is gone!" and Marie lay back on her lounge, and
began to sob disconsolately.
 
Marie was one of those unfortunately constituted mortals, in whose
eyes whatever is lost and gone assumes a value which it never had in
possession. Whatever she had, she seemed to survey only to pick flaws in
it but, once fairly away, there was no end to her valuation of it.
 
While this conversation was taking place in the parlor another was going
on in St. Clares library.
 
Tom, who was always uneasily following his master about, had seen him go
to his library, some hours before and, after vainly waiting for him to
come out, determined, at last, to make an errand in. He entered softly.
St. Clare lay on his lounge, at the further end of the room. He was
lying on his face, with Evas Bible open before him, at a little
distance. Tom walked up, and stood by the sofa. He hesitated and, while
he was hesitating, St. Clare suddenly raised himself up. The honest
face, so full of grief, and with such an imploring expression of
affection and sympathy, struck his master. He laid his hand on Toms,
and bowed down his forehead on it.
 
"O, Tom, my boy, the whole world is as empty as an eggshell."
 
"I know it, Masr,I know it," said Tom "but, oh, if Masr could only
look up,up where our dear Miss Eva is,up to the dear Lord Jesus!"
 
"Ah, Tom! I do look up but the trouble is, I dont see anything, when I
do, I wish I could."
 
Tom sighed heavily.
 
"It seems to be given to children, and poor, honest fellows, like you,
to see what we cant," said St. Clare. "How comes it?"
 
"Thou has hid from the wise and prudent, and revealed unto babes,"
murmured Tom "even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight."
 
"Tom, I dont believe,I cant believe,Ive got the habit of
doubting," said St. Clare. "I want to believe this Bible,and I cant."
 
"Dear Masr, pray to the good Lord,Lord, I believe help thou my
unbelief."
 
"Who knows anything about anything?" said St. Clare, his eyes wandering
dreamily, and speaking to himself. "Was all that beautiful love and
faith only one of the evershifting phases of human feeling, having
nothing real to rest on, passing away with the little breath? And is
there no more Eva,no heaven,no Christ,nothing?"
 
"O, dear Masr, there is! I know it Im sure of it," said Tom, falling
on his knees. "Do, do, dear Masr, believe it!"
 
"How do you know theres any Christ, Tom! You never saw the Lord."
 
"Felt Him in my soul, Masr,feel Him now! O, Masr, when I was sold
away from my old woman and the children, I was jest amost broke up. I
felt as if there warnt nothin left and then the good Lord, he stood
by me, and he says, Fear not, Tom and he brings light and joy in
a poor fellers soul,makes all peace and I s so happy, and loves
everybody, and feels willin jest to be the Lords, and have the Lords
will done, and be put jest where the Lord wants to put me. I know it
couldnt come from me, cause I s a poor, complainin cretur it comes
from the Lord and I know Hes willin to do for Masr."
 
Tom spoke with fastrunning tears and choking voice. St. Clare leaned
his head on his shoulder, and wrung the hard, faithful, black hand.
 
"Tom, you love me," he said.
 
"I s willin to lay down my life, this blessed day, to see Masr a
Christian."
 
"Poor, foolish boy!" said St. Clare, halfraising himself. "Im not
worth the love of one good, honest heart, like yours."
 
"O, Masr, deres more than me loves you,the blessed Lord Jesus loves
you."
 
"How do you know that Tom?" said St. Clare.
 
"Feels it in my soul. O, Masr! the love of Christ, that passeth
knowledge."
 
"Singular!" said St. Clare, turning away, "that the story of a man that
lived and died eighteen hundred years ago can affect people so yet.
But he was no man," he added, suddenly. "No man ever had such long and
living power! O, that I could believe what my mother taught me, and pray
as I did when I was a boy!"
 
"If Masr pleases," said Tom, "Miss Eva used to read this so
beautifully. I wish Masrd be so good as read it. Dont get no readin,
hardly, now Miss Evas gone."
 
The chapter was the eleventh of John,the touching account of the
raising of Lazarus, St. Clare read it aloud, often pausing to wrestle
down feelings which were roused by the pathos of the story. Tom knelt
before him, with clasped hands, and with an absorbed expression of love,
trust, adoration, on his quiet face.
 
"Tom," said his Master, "this is all _real_ to you!"
 
"I can jest fairly _see_ it Masr," said Tom.
 
"I wish I had your eyes, Tom."
 
"I wish, to the dear Lord, Masr had!"
 
"But, Tom, you know that I have a great deal more knowledge than you
what if I should tell you that I dont believe this Bible?"
 
"O, Masr!" said Tom, holding up his hands, with a deprecating gesture.
 
"Wouldnt it shake your faith some, Tom?"
 
"Not a grain," said Tom.
 
"Why, Tom, you must know I know the most."
 
"O, Masr, havent you jest read how he hides from the wise and prudent,
and reveals unto babes? But Masr wasnt in earnest, for sartin, now?"
said Tom, anxiously.
 
"No, Tom, I was not. I dont disbelieve, and I think there is reason to
believe and still I dont. Its a troublesome bad habit Ive got, Tom."
 
"If Masr would only pray!"
 
"How do you know I dont, Tom?"
 
"Does Masr?"
 
"I would, Tom, if there was anybody there when I pray but its all
speaking unto nothing, when I do. But come, Tom, you pray now, and show
me how."
 
Toms heart was full he poured it out in prayer, like waters that have
been long suppressed. One thing was plain enough Tom thought there was
somebody to hear, whether there were or not. In fact, St. Clare felt
himself borne, on the tide of his faith and feeling, almost to the gates
of that heaven he seemed so vividly to conceive. It seemed to bring him
nearer to Eva.
 
"Thank you, my boy," said St. Clare, when Tom rose. "I like to hear you,
Tom but go, now, and leave me alone some other time, Ill talk more."
 
Tom silently left the room.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXVIII
 
Reunion
 
 
Week after week glided away in the St. Clare mansion, and the waves of
life settled back to their usual flow, where that little bark had
gone down. For how imperiously, how coolly, in disregard of all ones
feeling, does the hard, cold, uninteresting course of daily realities
move on! Still must we eat, and drink, and sleep, and wake again,still
bargain, buy, sell, ask and answer questions,pursue, in short,
a thousand shadows, though all interest in them be over the cold
mechanical habit of living remaining, after all vital interest in it has
fled.
 
All the interests and hopes of St. Clares life had unconsciously wound
themselves around this child. It was for Eva that he had managed his
property it was for Eva that he had planned the disposal of his time
and, to do this and that for Eva,to buy, improve, alter, and arrange,
or dispose something for her,had been so long his habit, that now she
was gone, there seemed nothing to be thought of, and nothing to be done.
 
True, there was another life,a life which, once believed in, stands as
a solemn, significant figure before the otherwise unmeaning ciphers of
time, changing them to orders of mysterious, untold value. St. Clare
knew this well and often, in many a weary hour, he heard that slender,
childish voice calling him to the skies, and saw that little hand
pointing to him the way of life but a heavy lethargy of sorrow lay on
him,he could not arise. He had one of those natures which could better
and more clearly conceive of religious things from its own perceptions
and instincts, than many a matteroffact and practical Christian. The
gift to appreciate and the sense to feel the finer shades and relations
of moral things, often seems an attribute of those whose whole life
shows a careless disregard of them. Hence Moore, Byron, Goethe, often
speak words more wisely descriptive of the true religious sentiment,
than another man, whose whole life is governed by it. In such minds,
disregard of religion is a more fearful treason,a more deadly sin.
 
St. Clare had never pretended to govern himself by any religious
obligation and a certain fineness of nature gave him such an
instinctive view of the extent of the requirements of Christianity, that
he shrank, by anticipation, from what he felt would be the exactions
of his own conscience, if he once did resolve to assume them. For,
so inconsistent is human nature, especially in the ideal, that not to
undertake a thing at all seems better than to undertake and come short.
 
Still St. Clare was, in many respects, another man. He read his
little Evas Bible seriously and honestly he thought more soberly
and practically of his relations to his servants,enough to make him
extremely dissatisfied with both his past and present course and one
thing he did, soon after his return to New Orleans, and that was to
commence the legal steps necessary to Toms emancipation, which was to
be perfected as soon as he could get through the necessary formalities.
Meantime, he attached himself to Tom more and more, every day. In all
the wide world, there was nothing that seemed to remind him so much
of Eva and he would insist on keeping him constantly about him, and,
fastidious and unapproachable as he was with regard to his deeper
feelings, he almost thought aloud to Tom. Nor would any one have
wondered at it, who had seen the expression of affection and devotion
with which Tom continually followed his young master.
 
"Well, Tom," said St. Clare, the day after he had commenced the legal
formalities for his enfranchisement, "Im going to make a free man of
youso have your trunk packed, and get ready to set out for Kentuck."
 
The sudden light of joy that shone in Toms face as he raised his hands
to heaven, his emphatic "Bless the Lord!" rather discomposed St. Clare
he did not like it that Tom should be so ready to leave him.
 
"You havent had such very bad times here, that you need be in such a
rapture, Tom," he said drily.
 
"No, no, Masr! tant that,its bein a _freeman!_ thats what Im
joyin for."
 
"Why, Tom, dont you think, for your own part, youve been better off
than to be free?"
 
"_No, indeed_, Masr St. Clare," said Tom, with a flash of energy. "No,
indeed!"
 
"Why, Tom, you couldnt possibly have earned, by your work, such clothes
and such living as I have given you."
 
"Knows all that, Masr St. Clare Masrs been too good but, Masr,
Id rather have poor clothes, poor house, poor everything, and have em
_mine_, than have the best, and have em any mans else,I had _so_,
Masr I think its natur, Masr."
 
"I suppose so, Tom, and youll be going off and leaving me, in a month
or so," he added, rather discontentedly. "Though why you shouldnt, no
mortal knows," he said, in a gayer tone and, getting up, he began to
walk the floor.
 
"Not while Masr is in trouble," said Tom. "Ill stay with Masr as long
as he wants me,so as I can be any use."
 
"Not while Im in trouble, Tom?" said St. Clare, looking sadly out of
the window. . . . "And when will _my_ trouble be over?"
 
"When Masr St. Clares a Christian," said Tom.
 
"And you really mean to stay by till that day comes?" said St. Clare,
half smiling, as he turned from the window, and laid his hand on Toms
shoulder. "Ah, Tom, you soft, silly boy! I wont keep you till that day.
Go home to your wife and children, and give my love to all."
 
"I s faith to believe that day will come," said Tom, earnestly, and
with tears in his eyes "the Lord has a work for Masr."
 
"A work, hey?" said St. Clare, "well, now, Tom, give me your views on
what sort of a work it islets hear."
 
"Why, even a poor fellow like me has a work from the Lord and Masr St.
Clare, that has larnin, and riches, and friends,how much he might do
for the Lord!"
 
"Tom, you seem to think the Lord needs a great deal done for him," said
St. Clare, smiling.
 
"We does for the Lord when we does for his critturs," said Tom.
 
"Good theology, Tom better than Dr. B. preaches, I dare swear," said
St. Clare.
 
The conversation was here interrupted by the announcement of some
visitors.
 
Marie St. Clare felt the loss of Eva as deeply as she could feel
anything and, as she was a woman that had a great faculty of making
everybody unhappy when she was, her immediate attendants had still
stronger reason to regret the loss of their young mistress, whose
winning ways and gentle intercessions had so often been a shield to them
from the tyrannical and selfish exactions of her mother. Poor old Mammy,
in particular, whose heart, severed from all natural domestic ties, had
consoled itself with this one beautiful being, was almost heartbroken.
She cried day and night, and was, from excess of sorrow, less skilful
and alert in her ministrations of her mistress than usual, which drew
down a constant storm of invectives on her defenceless head.
 
Miss Ophelia felt the loss but, in her good and honest heart, it bore
fruit unto everlasting life. She was more softened, more gentle and,
though equally assiduous in every duty, it was with a chastened and
quiet air, as one who communed with her own heart not in vain. She was
more diligent in teaching Topsy,taught her mainly from the Bible,did
not any longer shrink from her touch, or manifest an illrepressed
disgust, because she felt none. She viewed her now through the softened
medium that Evas hand had first held before her eyes, and saw in her
only an immortal creature, whom God had sent to be led by her to glory
and virtue. Topsy did not become at once a saint but the life and death
of Eva did work a marked change in her. The callous indifference was
gone there was now sensibility, hope, desire, and the striving for
good,a strife irregular, interrupted, suspended oft, but yet renewed
again.
 
One day, when Topsy had been sent for by Miss Ophelia, she came, hastily
thrusting something into her bosom.
 
"What are you doing there, you limb? Youve been stealing something,
Ill be bound," said the imperious little Rosa, who had been sent to
call her, seizing her, at the same time, roughly by the arm.
 
"You go long, Miss Rosa!" said Topsy, pulling from her "tant none o
your business!"
 
"None o your sace!" said Rosa, "I saw you hiding something,I know
yer tricks," and Rosa seized her arm, and tried to force her hand into
her bosom, while Topsy, enraged, kicked and fought valiantly for what
she considered her rights. The clamor and confusion of the battle drew
Miss Ophelia and St. Clare both to the spot.
 
"Shes been stealing!" said Rosa.
 
"I hant, neither!" vociferated Topsy, sobbing with passion.
 
"Give me that, whatever it is!" said Miss Ophelia, firmly.
 
Topsy hesitated but, on a second order, pulled out of her bosom a
little parcel done up in the foot of one of her own old stockings.
 
Miss Ophelia turned it out. There was a small book, which had been given
to Topsy by Eva, containing a single verse of Scripture, arranged for
every day in the year, and in a paper the curl of hair that she had
given her on that memorable day when she had taken her last farewell.
 
St. Clare was a good deal affected at the sight of it the little book
had been rolled in a long strip of black crape, torn from the funeral
weeds.
 
"What did you wrap _this_ round the book for?" said St. Clare, holding
up the crape.
 
"Cause,cause,cause t was Miss Eva. O, dont take em away, please!"
she said and, sitting flat down on the floor, and putting her apron
over her head, she began to sob vehemently.
 
It was a curious mixture of the pathetic and the ludicrous,the little
old stockings,black crape,textbook,fair, soft curl,and Topsys
utter distress.
 
St. Clare smiled but there were tears in his eyes, as he said,
 
"Come, come,dont cry you shall have them!" and, putting them
together, he threw them into her lap, and drew Miss Ophelia with him
into the parlor.
 
"I really think you can make something of that concern," he said,
pointing with his thumb backward over his shoulder. "Any mind that
is capable of a _real sorrow_ is capable of good. You must try and do
something with her."
 
"The child has improved greatly," said Miss Ophelia. "I have great hopes
of her but, Augustine," she said, laying her hand on his arm, "one
thing I want to ask whose is this child to be?yours or mine?"
 
"Why, I gave her to you," said Augustine.
 
"But not legallyI want her to be mine legally," said Miss Ophelia.
 
"Whew! cousin," said Augustine. "What will the Abolition Society think?
Theyll have a day of fasting appointed for this backsliding, if you
become a slaveholder!"
 
"O, nonsense! I want her mine, that I may have a right to take her to
the free States, and give her her liberty, that all I am trying to do be
not undone."
 
"O, cousin, what an awful doing evil that good may come! I cant
encourage it."
 
"I dont want you to joke, but to reason," said Miss Ophelia. "There is
no use in my trying to make this child a Christian child, unless I save
her from all the chances and reverses of slavery and, if you really are
willing I should have her, I want you to give me a deed of gift, or some
legal paper."
 
"Well, well," said St. Clare, "I will" and he sat down, and unfolded a
newspaper to read.
 
"But I want it done now," said Miss Ophelia.
 
"Whats your hurry?"
 
"Because now is the only time there ever is to do a thing in," said Miss
Ophelia. "Come, now, heres paper, pen, and ink just write a paper."
 
St. Clare, like most men of his class of mind, cordially hated the
present tense of action, generally and, therefore, he was considerably
annoyed by Miss Ophelias downrightness.
 
"Why, whats the matter?" said he. "Cant you take my word? One would
think you had taken lessons of the Jews, coming at a fellow so!"
 
"I want to make sure of it," said Miss Ophelia. "You may die, or fail,
and then Topsy be hustled off to auction, spite of all I can do."
 
"Really, you are quite provident. Well, seeing Im in the hands of a
Yankee, there is nothing for it but to concede" and St. Clare rapidly
wrote off a deed of gift, which, as he was well versed in the forms
of law, he could easily do, and signed his name to it in sprawling
capitals, concluding by a tremendous flourish.
 
"There, isnt that black and white, now, Miss Vermont?" he said, as he
handed it to her.
 
"Good boy," said Miss Ophelia, smiling. "But must it not be witnessed?"
 
"O, bother!yes. Here," he said, opening the door into Maries
apartment, "Marie, Cousin wants your autograph just put your name down
here."
 
"Whats this?" said Marie, as she ran over the paper. "Ridiculous! I
thought Cousin was too pious for such horrid things," she added, as she
carelessly wrote her name "but, if she has a fancy for that article, I
am sure shes welcome."
 
"There, now, shes yours, body and soul," said St. Clare, handing the
paper.
 
"No more mine now than she was before," Miss Ophelia. "Nobody but God
has a right to give her to me but I can protect her now."
 
"Well, shes yours by a fiction of law, then," said St. Clare, as he
turned back into the parlor, and sat down to his paper.
 
Miss Ophelia, who seldom sat much in Maries company, followed him into
the parlor, having first carefully laid away the paper.
 
"Augustine," she said, suddenly, as she sat knitting, "have you ever
made any provision for your servants, in case of your death?"
 
"No," said St. Clare, as he read on.
 
"Then all your indulgence to them may prove a great cruelty, by and by."
 
St. Clare had often thought the same thing himself but he answered,
negligently.
 
"Well, I mean to make a provision, by and by."
 
"When?" said Miss Ophelia.
 
"O, one of these days."
 
"What if you should die first?"
 
"Cousin, whats the matter?" said St. Clare, laying down his paper
and looking at her. "Do you think I show symptoms of yellow fever or
cholera, that you are making post mortem arrangements with such zeal?"
 
"In the midst of life we are in death," said Miss Ophelia.
 
St. Clare rose up, and laying the paper down, carelessly, walked to the
door that stood open on the verandah, to put an end to a conversation
that was not agreeable to him. Mechanically, he repeated the last word
again,_"Death!"_and, as he leaned against the railings, and watched
the sparkling water as it rose and fell in the fountain and, as in a
dim and dizzy haze, saw flowers and trees and vases of the courts, he
repeated, again the mystic word so common in every mouth, yet of such
fearful power,"DEATH!" "Strange that there should be such a word,"
he said, "and such a thing, and we ever forget it that one should be
living, warm and beautiful, full of hopes, desires and wants, one day,
and the next be gone, utterly gone, and forever!"
 
It was a warm, golden evening and, as he walked to the other end of the
verandah, he saw Tom busily intent on his Bible, pointing, as he did so,
with his finger to each successive word, and whispering them to himself
with an earnest air.
 
"Want me to read to you, Tom?" said St. Clare, seating himself
carelessly by him.
 
"If Masr pleases," said Tom, gratefully, "Masr makes it so much
plainer."
 
St. Clare took the book and glanced at the place, and began reading one
of the passages which Tom had designated by the heavy marks around it.
It ran as follows
 
"When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all his holy angels
with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before
him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from
another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats." St. Clare
read on in an animated voice, till he came to the last of the verses.
 
"Then shall the king say unto him on his left hand, Depart from me, ye
cursed, into everlasting fire for I was an hungered, and ye gave me no
meat I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink I was a stranger, and ye
took me not in naked, and ye clothed me not I was sick, and in prison,
and ye visited me not. Then shall they answer unto Him, Lord when saw
we thee an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or
in prison, and did not minister unto thee? Then shall he say unto them,
Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these my brethren, ye
did it not to me."
 
St. Clare seemed struck with this last passage, for he read it
twice,the second time slowly, and as if he were revolving the words in
his mind.
 
"Tom," he said, "these folks that get such hard measure seem to have
been doing just what I have,living good, easy, respectable lives
and not troubling themselves to inquire how many of their brethren were
hungry or athirst, or sick, or in prison."
 
Tom did not answer.
 
St. Clare rose up and walked thoughtfully up and down the verandah,
seeming to forget everything in his own thoughts so absorbed was he,
that Tom had to remind him twice that the teabell had rung, before he
could get his attention.
 
St. Clare was absent and thoughtful, all teatime. After tea, he and
Marie and Miss Ophelia took possession of the parlor almost in silence.
 
Marie disposed herself on a lounge, under a silken mosquito curtain,
and was soon sound asleep. Miss Ophelia silently busied herself with her
knitting. St. Clare sat down to the piano, and began playing a soft and
melancholy movement with the Æolian accompaniment. He seemed in a deep
reverie, and to be soliloquizing to himself by music. After a little, he
opened one of the drawers, took out an old musicbook whose leaves were
yellow with age, and began turning it over.
 
"There," he said to Miss Ophelia, "this was one of my mothers
books,and here is her handwriting,come and look at it. She copied
and arranged this from Mozarts Requiem." Miss Ophelia came accordingly.
 
"It was something she used to sing often," said St. Clare. "I think I
can hear her now."
 
He struck a few majestic chords, and began singing that grand old Latin
piece, the "Dies Iræ."
 
Tom, who was listening in the outer verandah, was drawn by the sound
to the very door, where he stood earnestly. He did not understand the
words, of course but the music and manner of singing appeared to affect
him strongly, especially when St. Clare sang the more pathetic parts.
Tom would have sympathized more heartily, if he had known the meaning of
the beautiful words
 
    "Recordare Jesu pie
     Quod sum causa tuær viæ
     Ne me perdas, illa die
     Quærens me sedisti lassus
     Redemisti crucem passus
     Tantus labor non sit cassus."
 
 
      These lines have been thus rather inadequately translated
 
    "Think, O Jesus, for what reason
     Thou enduredst earths spite and treason,
     Nor me lose, in that dread season
     Seeking me, thy worn feet hasted,
     On the cross thy soul death tasted,
     Let not all these toils be wasted."
     Mrs. Stowes note.
 
St. Clare threw a deep and pathetic expression into the words for
the shadowy veil of years seemed drawn away, and he seemed to hear his
mothers voice leading his. Voice and instrument seemed both living, and
threw out with vivid sympathy those strains which the ethereal Mozart
first conceived as his own dying requiem.
 
When St. Clare had done singing, he sat leaning his head upon his hand a
few moments, and then began walking up and down the floor.
 
"What a sublime conception is that of a last judgment!" said he,"a
righting of all the wrongs of ages!a solving of all moral problems, by
an unanswerable wisdom! It is, indeed, a wonderful image."
 
"It is a fearful one to us," said Miss Ophelia.
 
"It ought to be to me, I suppose," said St. Clare stopping,
thoughtfully. "I was reading to Tom, this afternoon, that chapter in
Matthew that gives an account of it, and I have been quite struck with
it. One should have expected some terrible enormities charged to those
who are excluded from Heaven, as the reason but no,they are condemned
for _not_ doing positive good, as if that included every possible harm."
 
"Perhaps," said Miss Ophelia, "it is impossible for a person who does no
good not to do harm."
 
"And what," said St. Clare, speaking abstractedly, but with deep
feeling, "what shall be said of one whose own heart, whose education,
and the wants of society, have called in vain to some noble purpose who
has floated on, a dreamy, neutral spectator of the struggles, agonies,
and wrongs of man, when he should have been a worker?"
 
"I should say," said Miss Ophelia, "that he ought to repent, and begin
now."
 
"Always practical and to the point!" said St. Clare, his face breaking
out into a smile. "You never leave me any time for general reflections,
Cousin you always bring me short up against the actual present you
have a kind of eternal _now_, always in your mind."
 
"_Now_ is all the time I have anything to do with," said Miss Ophelia.
 
"Dear little Eva,poor child!" said St. Clare, "she had set her little
simple soul on a good work for me."
 
It was the first time since Evas death that he had ever said as many
words as these to her, and he spoke now evidently repressing very strong
feeling.
 
"My view of Christianity is such," he added, "that I think no man can
consistently profess it without throwing the whole weight of his being
against this monstrous system of injustice that lies at the foundation
of all our society and, if need be, sacrificing himself in the battle.
That is, I mean that _I_ could not be a Christian otherwise, though
I have certainly had intercourse with a great many enlightened and
Christian people who did no such thing and I confess that the apathy
of religious people on this subject, their want of perception of wrongs
that filled me with horror, have engendered in me more scepticism than
any other thing."
 
"If you knew all this," said Miss Ophelia, "why didnt you do it?"
 
"O, because I have had only that kind of benevolence which consists in
lying on a sofa, and cursing the church and clergy for not being martyrs
and confessors. One can see, you know, very easily, how others ought to
be martyrs."
 
"Well, are you going to do differently now?" said Miss Ophelia.
 
"God only knows the future," said St. Clare. "I am braver than I was,
because I have lost all and he who has nothing to lose can afford all
risks."
 
"And what are you going to do?"
 
"My duty, I hope, to the poor and lowly, as fast as I find it out," said
St. Clare, "beginning with my own servants, for whom I have yet done
nothing and, perhaps, at some future day, it may appear that I can
do something for a whole class something to save my country from the
disgrace of that false position in which she now stands before all
civilized nations."
 
"Do you suppose it possible that a nation ever will voluntarily
emancipate?" said Miss Ophelia.
 
"I dont know," said St. Clare. "This is a day of great deeds. Heroism
and disinterestedness are rising up, here and there, in the earth. The
Hungarian nobles set free millions of serfs, at an immense pecuniary
loss and, perhaps, among us may be found generous spirits, who do not
estimate honor and justice by dollars and cents."
 
"I hardly think so," said Miss Ophelia.
 
"But, suppose we should rise up tomorrow and emancipate, who would
educate these millions, and teach them how to use their freedom? They
never would rise to do much among us. The fact is, we are too lazy
and unpractical, ourselves, ever to give them much of an idea of that
industry and energy which is necessary to form them into men. They will
have to go north, where labor is the fashion,the universal custom
and tell me, now, is there enough Christian philanthropy, among your
northern states, to bear with the process of their education and
elevation? You send thousands of dollars to foreign missions but could
you endure to have the heathen sent into your towns and villages, and
give your time, and thoughts, and money, to raise them to the Christian
standard? Thats what I want to know. If we emancipate, are you willing
to educate? How many families, in your town, would take a negro man and
woman, teach them, bear with them, and seek to make them Christians? How
many merchants would take Adolph, if I wanted to make him a clerk or
mechanics, if I wanted him taught a trade? If I wanted to put Jane and
Rosa to a school, how many schools are there in the northern states that
would take them in? how many families that would board them? and yet
they are as white as many a woman, north or south. You see, Cousin,
I want justice done us. We are in a bad position. We are the more
_obvious_ oppressors of the negro but the unchristian prejudice of the
north is an oppressor almost equally severe."
 
"Well, Cousin, I know it is so," said Miss Ophelia,"I know it was so
with me, till I saw that it was my duty to overcome it but, I trust I
have overcome it and I know there are many good people at the north,
who in this matter need only to be _taught_ what their duty is, to do
it. It would certainly be a greater selfdenial to receive heathen among
us, than to send missionaries to them but I think we would do it."
 
"_You_ would, I know," said St. Clare. "Id like to see anything you
wouldnt do, if you thought it your duty!"
 
"Well, Im not uncommonly good," said Miss Ophelia. "Others would,
if they saw things as I do. I intend to take Topsy home, when I go.
I suppose our folks will wonder, at first but I think they will be
brought to see as I do. Besides, I know there are many people at the
north who do exactly what you said."
 
"Yes, but they are a minority and, if we should begin to emancipate to
any extent, we should soon hear from you."
 
Miss Ophelia did not reply. There was a pause of some moments and St.
Clares countenance was overcast by a sad, dreamy expression.
 
"I dont know what makes me think of my mother so much, tonight," he
said. "I have a strange kind of feeling, as if she were near me. I keep
thinking of things she used to say. Strange, what brings these past
things so vividly back to us, sometimes!"
 
St. Clare walked up and down the room for some minutes more, and then
said,
 
"I believe Ill go down street, a few moments, and hear the news,
tonight."
 
He took his hat, and passed out.
 
Tom followed him to the passage, out of the court, and asked if he
should attend him.
 
"No, my boy," said St. Clare. "I shall be back in an hour."
 
Tom sat down in the verandah. It was a beautiful moonlight evening,
and he sat watching the rising and falling spray of the fountain, and
listening to its murmur. Tom thought of his home, and that he should
soon be a free man, and able to return to it at will. He thought how he
should work to buy his wife and boys. He felt the muscles of his
brawny arms with a sort of joy, as he thought they would soon belong
to himself, and how much they could do to work out the freedom of his
family. Then he thought of his noble young master, and, ever second to
that, came the habitual prayer that he had always offered for him and
then his thoughts passed on to the beautiful Eva, whom he now thought of
among the angels and he thought till he almost fancied that that bright
face and golden hair were looking upon him, out of the spray of the
fountain. And, so musing, he fell asleep, and dreamed he saw her
coming bounding towards him, just as she used to come, with a wreath
of jessamine in her hair, her cheeks bright, and her eyes radiant with
delight but, as he looked, she seemed to rise from the ground her
cheeks wore a paler hue,her eyes had a deep, divine radiance, a golden
halo seemed around her head,and she vanished from his sight and Tom
was awakened by a loud knocking, and a sound of many voices at the gate.
 
He hastened to undo it and, with smothered voices and heavy tread,
came several men, bringing a body, wrapped in a cloak, and lying on a
shutter. The light of the lamp fell full on the face and Tom gave a
wild cry of amazement and despair, that rung through all the galleries,
as the men advanced, with their burden, to the open parlor door, where
Miss Ophelia still sat knitting.
 
St. Clare had turned into a cafe, to look over an evening paper. As he
was reading, an affray arose between two gentlemen in the room, who
were both partially intoxicated. St. Clare and one or two others made an
effort to separate them, and St. Clare received a fatal stab in the side
with a bowieknife, which he was attempting to wrest from one of them.
 
The house was full of cries and lamentations, shrieks and screams,
servants frantically tearing their hair, throwing themselves on the
ground, or running distractedly about, lamenting. Tom and Miss Ophelia
alone seemed to have any presence of mind for Marie was in strong
hysteric convulsions. At Miss Ophelias direction, one of the lounges in
the parlor was hastily prepared, and the bleeding form laid upon it. St.
Clare had fainted, through pain and loss of blood but, as Miss Ophelia
applied restoratives, he revived, opened his eyes, looked fixedly on
them, looked earnestly around the room, his eyes travelling wistfully
over every object, and finally they rested on his mothers picture.
 
The physician now arrived, and made his examination. It was evident,
from the expression of his face, that there was no hope but he applied
himself to dressing the wound, and he and Miss Ophelia and Tom proceeded
composedly with this work, amid the lamentations and sobs and cries of
the affrighted servants, who had clustered about the doors and windows
of the verandah.
 
"Now," said the physician, "we must turn all these creatures out all
depends on his being kept quiet."
 
St. Clare opened his eyes, and looked fixedly on the distressed beings,
whom Miss Ophelia and the doctor were trying to urge from the apartment.
"Poor creatures!" he said, and an expression of bitter selfreproach
passed over his face. Adolph absolutely refused to go. Terror had
deprived him of all presence of mind he threw himself along the
floor, and nothing could persuade him to rise. The rest yielded to Miss
Ophelias urgent representations, that their masters safety depended on
their stillness and obedience.
 
St. Clare could say but little he lay with his eyes shut, but it was
evident that he wrestled with bitter thoughts. After a while, he laid
his hand on Toms, who was kneeling beside him, and said, "Tom! poor
fellow!"
 
"What, Masr?" said Tom, earnestly.
 
"I am dying!" said St. Clare, pressing his hand "pray!"
 
"If you would like a clergyman" said the physician.
 
St. Clare hastily shook his head, and said again to Tom, more earnestly,
"Pray!"
 
And Tom did pray, with all his mind and strength, for the soul that was
passing,the soul that seemed looking so steadily and mournfully from
those large, melancholy blue eyes. It was literally prayer offered with
strong crying and tears.
 
When Tom ceased to speak, St. Clare reached out and took his hand,
looking earnestly at him, but saying nothing. He closed his eyes, but
still retained his hold for, in the gates of eternity, the black hand
and the white hold each other with an equal clasp. He murmured softly to
himself, at broken intervals,
 
     "Recordare Jesu pie
           
     Ne me perdasilla die
     Quærens mesedisti lassus."
 
It was evident that the words he had been singing that evening were
passing through his mind,words of entreaty addressed to Infinite Pity.
His lips moved at intervals, as parts of the hymn fell brokenly from
them.
 
"His mind is wandering," said the doctor.
 
"No! it is coming HOME, at last!" said St. Clare, energetically "at
last! at last!"
 
The effort of speaking exhausted him. The sinking paleness of death
fell on him but with it there fell, as if shed from the wings of some
pitying spirit, a beautiful expression of peace, like that of a wearied
child who sleeps.
 
So he lay for a few moments. They saw that the mighty hand was on him.
Just before the spirit parted, he opened his eyes, with a sudden light,
as of joy and recognition, and said _"Mother!"_ and then he was gone!
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXIX
 
The Unprotected
 
 
We hear often of the distress of the negro servants, on the loss of a
kind master and with good reason, for no creature on Gods earth is
left more utterly unprotected and desolate than the slave in these
circumstances.
 
The child who has lost a father has still the protection of friends,
and of the law he is something, and can do something,has acknowledged
rights and position the slave has none. The law regards him, in every
respect, as devoid of rights as a bale of merchandise. The only possible
acknowledgment of any of the longings and wants of a human and immortal
creature, which are given to him, comes to him through the sovereign and
irresponsible will of his master and when that master is stricken down,
nothing remains.
 
The number of those men who know how to use wholly irresponsible power
humanely and generously is small. Everybody knows this, and the slave
knows it best of all so that he feels that there are ten chances of
his finding an abusive and tyrannical master, to one of his finding
a considerate and kind one. Therefore is it that the wail over a kind
master is loud and long, as well it may be.
 
When St. Clare breathed his last, terror and consternation took hold
of all his household. He had been stricken down so in a moment, in the
flower and strength of his youth! Every room and gallery of the house
resounded with sobs and shrieks of despair.
 
Marie, whose nervous system had been enervated by a constant course of
selfindulgence, had nothing to support the terror of the shock, and,
at the time her husband breathed his last, was passing from one fainting
fit to another and he to whom she had been joined in the mysterious tie
of marriage passed from her forever, without the possibility of even a
parting word.
 
Miss Ophelia, with characteristic strength and selfcontrol, had
remained with her kinsman to the last,all eye, all ear, all attention
doing everything of the little that could be done, and joining with her
whole soul in the tender and impassioned prayers which the poor slave
had poured forth for the soul of his dying master.
 
When they were arranging him for his last rest, they found upon his
bosom a small, plain miniature case, opening with a spring. It was the
miniature of a noble and beautiful female face and on the reverse,
under a crystal, a lock of dark hair. They laid them back on the
lifeless breast,dust to dust,poor mournful relics of early dreams,
which once made that cold heart beat so warmly!
 
Toms whole soul was filled with thoughts of eternity and while he
ministered around the lifeless clay, he did not once think that the
sudden stroke had left him in hopeless slavery. He felt at peace about
his master for in that hour, when he had poured forth his prayer
into the bosom of his Father, he had found an answer of quietness
and assurance springing up within himself. In the depths of his own
affectionate nature, he felt able to perceive something of the fulness
of Divine love for an old oracle hath thus written,"He that dwelleth
in love dwelleth in God, and God in him." Tom hoped and trusted, and was
at peace.
 
But the funeral passed, with all its pageant of black crape, and
prayers, and solemn faces and back rolled the cool, muddy waves of
everyday life and up came the everlasting hard inquiry of "What is to
be done next?"
 
It rose to the mind of Marie, as, dressed in loose morningrobes, and
surrounded by anxious servants, she sat up in a great easychair, and
inspected samples of crape and bombazine. It rose to Miss Ophelia, who
began to turn her thoughts towards her northern home. It rose, in silent
terrors, to the minds of the servants, who well knew the unfeeling,
tyrannical character of the mistress in whose hands they were left. All
knew, very well, that the indulgences which had been accorded to them
were not from their mistress, but from their master and that, now he
was gone, there would be no screen between them and every tyrannous
infliction which a temper soured by affliction might devise.
 
It was about a fortnight after the funeral, that Miss Ophelia, busied
one day in her apartment, heard a gentle tap at the door. She opened
it, and there stood Rosa, the pretty young quadroon, whom we have before
often noticed, her hair in disorder, and her eyes swelled with crying.
 
"O, Miss Feeley," she said, falling on her knees, and catching the skirt
of her dress, "_do, do go_ to Miss Marie for me! do plead for me! Shes
goin to send me out to be whippedlook there!" And she handed to Miss
Ophelia a paper.
 
It was an order, written in Maries delicate Italian hand, to the master
of a whippingestablishment to give the bearer fifteen lashes.
 
"What have you been doing?" said Miss Ophelia.
 
"You know, Miss Feely, Ive got such a bad temper its very bad of me.
I was trying on Miss Maries dress, and she slapped my face and I spoke
out before I thought, and was saucy and she said that shed bring
me down, and have me know, once for all, that I wasnt going to be so
topping as I had been and she wrote this, and says I shall carry it.
Id rather shed kill me, right out."
 
Miss Ophelia stood considering, with the paper in her hand.
 
"You see, Miss Feely," said Rosa, "I dont mind the whipping so much, if
Miss Marie or you was to do it but, to be sent to a _man!_ and such a
horrid man,the shame of it, Miss Feely!"
 
Miss Ophelia well knew that it was the universal custom to send women
and young girls to whippinghouses, to the hands of the lowest of
men,men vile enough to make this their profession,there to be
subjected to brutal exposure and shameful correction. She had _known_ it
before but hitherto she had never realized it, till she saw the slender
form of Rosa almost convulsed with distress. All the honest blood of
womanhood, the strong New England blood of liberty, flushed to her
cheeks, and throbbed bitterly in her indignant heart but, with habitual
prudence and selfcontrol, she mastered herself, and, crushing the paper
firmly in her hand, she merely said to Rosa,
 
"Sit down, child, while I go to your mistress."
 
"Shameful! monstrous! outrageous!" she said to herself, as she was
crossing the parlor.
 
She found Marie sitting up in her easychair, with Mammy standing
by her, combing her hair Jane sat on the ground before her, busy in
chafing her feet.
 
"How do you find yourself, today?" said Miss Ophelia.
 
A deep sigh, and a closing of the eyes, was the only reply, for a
moment and then Marie answered, "O, I dont know, Cousin I suppose
Im as well as I ever shall be!" and Marie wiped her eyes with a cambric
handkerchief, bordered with an inch deep of black.
 
"I came," said Miss Ophelia, with a short, dry cough, such as commonly
introduces a difficult subject,"I came to speak with you about poor
Rosa."
 
Maries eyes were open wide enough now, and a flush rose to her sallow
cheeks, as she answered, sharply,
 
"Well, what about her?"
 
"She is very sorry for her fault."
 
"She is, is she? Shell be sorrier, before Ive done with her! Ive
endured that childs impudence long enough and now Ill bring her
down,Ill make her lie in the dust!"
 
"But could not you punish her some other way,some way that would be
less shameful?"
 
"I mean to shame her thats just what I want. She has all her life
presumed on her delicacy, and her good looks, and her ladylike airs,
till she forgets who she isand Ill give her one lesson that will
bring her down, I fancy!"
 
"But, Cousin, consider that, if you destroy delicacy and a sense of
shame in a young girl, you deprave her very fast."
 
"Delicacy!" said Marie, with a scornful laugh,"a fine word for such
as she! Ill teach her, with all her airs, that shes no better than the
raggedest black wench that walks the streets! Shell take no more airs
with me!"
 
"You will answer to God for such cruelty!" said Miss Ophelia, with
energy.
 
"Cruelty,Id like to know what the cruelty is! I wrote orders for only
fifteen lashes, and told him to put them on lightly. Im sure theres no
cruelty there!"
 
"No cruelty!" said Miss Ophelia. "Im sure any girl might rather be
killed outright!"
 
"It might seem so to anybody with your feeling but all these creatures
get used to it its the only way they can be kept in order. Once let
them feel that they are to take any airs about delicacy, and all that,
and theyll run all over you, just as my servants always have. Ive
begun now to bring them under and Ill have them all to know that
Ill send one out to be whipped, as soon as another, if they dont mind
themselves!" said Marie, looking around her decidedly.
 
Jane hung her head and cowered at this, for she felt as if it was
particularly directed to her. Miss Ophelia sat for a moment, as if she
had swallowed some explosive mixture, and were ready to burst. Then,
recollecting the utter uselessness of contention with such a nature,
she shut her lips resolutely, gathered herself up, and walked out of the
room.
 
It was hard to go back and tell Rosa that she could do nothing for
her and, shortly after, one of the manservants came to say that her
mistress had ordered him to take Rosa with him to the whippinghouse,
whither she was hurried, in spite of her tears and entreaties.
 
A few days after, Tom was standing musing by the balconies, when he was
joined by Adolph, who, since the death of his master, had been entirely
crestfallen and disconsolate. Adolph knew that he had always been an
object of dislike to Marie but while his master lived he had paid but
little attention to it. Now that he was gone, he had moved about in
daily dread and trembling, not knowing what might befall him next. Marie
had held several consultations with her lawyer after communicating with
St. Clares brother, it was determined to sell the place, and all the
servants, except her own personal property, and these she intended to
take with her, and go back to her fathers plantation.
 
"Do ye know, Tom, that weve all got to be sold?" said Adolph.
 
"How did you hear that?" said Tom.
 
"I hid myself behind the curtains when Missis was talking with the
lawyer. In a few days we shall be sent off to auction, Tom."
 
"The Lords will be done!" said Tom, folding his arms and sighing
heavily.
 
"Well never get another such a master," said Adolph, apprehensively
"but Id rather be sold than take my chance under Missis."
 
Tom turned away his heart was full. The hope of liberty, the thought
of distant wife and children, rose up before his patient soul, as to the
mariner shipwrecked almost in port rises the vision of the churchspire
and loving roofs of his native village, seen over the top of some black
wave only for one last farewell. He drew his arms tightly over his
bosom, and choked back the bitter tears, and tried to pray. The poor old
soul had such a singular, unaccountable prejudice in favor of liberty,
that it was a hard wrench for him and the more he said, "Thy will be
done," the worse he felt.
 
He sought Miss Ophelia, who, ever since Evas death, had treated him
with marked and respectful kindness.
 
"Miss Feely," he said, "Masr St. Clare promised me my freedom. He told
me that he had begun to take it out for me and now, perhaps, if Miss
Feely would be good enough to speak bout it to Missis, she would feel
like goin on with it, was it as Masr St. Clares wish."
 
"Ill speak for you, Tom, and do my best," said Miss Ophelia "but, if
it depends on Mrs. St. Clare, I cant hope much for younevertheless,
I will try."
 
This incident occurred a few days after that of Rosa, while Miss Ophelia
was busied in preparations to return north.
 
Seriously reflecting within herself, she considered that perhaps she had
shown too hasty a warmth of language in her former interview with Marie
and she resolved that she would now endeavor to moderate her zeal, and
to be as conciliatory as possible. So the good soul gathered herself
up, and, taking her knitting, resolved to go into Maries room, be as
agreeable as possible, and negotiate Toms case with all the diplomatic
skill of which she was mistress.
 
She found Marie reclining at length upon a lounge, supporting herself
on one elbow by pillows, while Jane, who had been out shopping, was
displaying before her certain samples of thin black stuffs.
 
"That will do," said Marie, selecting one "only Im not sure about its
being properly mourning."
 
"Laws, Missis," said Jane, volubly, "Mrs. General Derbennon wore just
this very thing, after the General died, last summer it makes up
lovely!"
 
"What do you think?" said Marie to Miss Ophelia.
 
"Its a matter of custom, I suppose," said Miss Ophelia. "You can judge
about it better than I."
 
"The fact is," said Marie, "that I havent a dress in the world that I
can wear and, as I am going to break up the establishment, and go off,
next week, I must decide upon something."
 
"Are you going so soon?"
 
"Yes. St. Clares brother has written, and he and the lawyer think that
the servants and furniture had better be put up at auction, and the
place left with our lawyer."
 
"Theres one thing I wanted to speak with you about," said Miss Ophelia.
"Augustine promised Tom his liberty, and began the legal forms necessary
to it. I hope you will use your influence to have it perfected."
 
"Indeed, I shall do no such thing!" said Marie, sharply. "Tom is one of
the most valuable servants on the place,it couldnt be afforded, any
way. Besides, what does he want of liberty? Hes a great deal better off
as he is."
 
"But he does desire it, very earnestly, and his master promised it,"
said Miss Ophelia.
 
"I dare say he does want it," said Marie "they all want it, just
because they are a discontented set,always wanting what they havent
got. Now, Im principled against emancipating, in any case. Keep a negro
under the care of a master, and he does well enough, and is respectable
but set them free, and they get lazy, and wont work, and take to
drinking, and go all down to be mean, worthless fellows, Ive seen it
tried, hundreds of times. Its no favor to set them free."
 
"But Tom is so steady, industrious, and pious."
 
"O, you neednt tell me! Ive see a hundred like him. Hell do very
well, as long as hes taken care of,thats all."
 
"But, then, consider," said Miss Ophelia, "when you set him up for sale,
the chances of his getting a bad master."
 
"O, thats all humbug!" said Marie "it isnt one time in a hundred that
a good fellow gets a bad master most masters are good, for all the talk
that is made. Ive lived and grown up here, in the South, and I
never yet was acquainted with a master that didnt treat his servants
well,quite as well as is worth while. I dont feel any fears on that
head."
 
"Well," said Miss Ophelia, energetically, "I know it was one of the last
wishes of your husband that Tom should have his liberty it was one of
the promises that he made to dear little Eva on her deathbed, and I
should not think you would feel at liberty to disregard it."
 
Marie had her face covered with her handkerchief at this appeal, and
began sobbing and using her smellingbottle, with great vehemence.
 
"Everybody goes against me!" she said. "Everybody is so inconsiderate! I
shouldnt have expected that _you_ would bring up all these remembrances
of my troubles to me,its so inconsiderate! But nobody ever does
consider,my trials are so peculiar! Its so hard, that when I had only
one daughter, she should have been taken!and when I had a husband that
just exactly suited me,and Im so hard to be suited!he should be
taken! And you seem to have so little feeling for me, and keep bringing
it up to me so carelessly,when you know how it overcomes me! I suppose
you mean well but it is very inconsiderate,very!" And Marie sobbed,
and gasped for breath, and called Mammy to open the window, and to bring
her the camphorbottle, and to bathe her head, and unhook her dress.
And, in the general confusion that ensued, Miss Ophelia made her escape
to her apartment.
 
She saw, at once, that it would do no good to say anything more for
Marie had an indefinite capacity for hysteric fits and, after this,
whenever her husbands or Evas wishes with regard to the servants were
alluded to, she always found it convenient to set one in operation.
Miss Ophelia, therefore, did the next best thing she could for Tom,she
wrote a letter to Mrs. Shelby for him, stating his troubles, and urging
them to send to his relief.
 
The next day, Tom and Adolph, and some half a dozen other servants,
were marched down to a slavewarehouse, to await the convenience of the
trader, who was going to make up a lot for auction.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXX
 
The Slave Warehouse
 
A slave warehouse! Perhaps some of my readers conjure up horrible
visions of such a place. They fancy some foul, obscure den, some
horrible _Tartarus "informis, ingens, cui lumen ademptum."_ But no,
innocent friend in these days men have learned the art of sinning
expertly and genteelly, so as not to shock the eyes and senses of
respectable society. Human property is high in the market and is,
therefore, well fed, well cleaned, tended, and looked after, that it may
come to sale sleek, and strong, and shining. A slavewarehouse in New
Orleans is a house externally not much unlike many others, kept with
neatness and where every day you may see arranged, under a sort of shed
along the outside, rows of men and women, who stand there as a sign of
the property sold within.
 
Then you shall be courteously entreated to call and examine, and shall
find an abundance of husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, fathers,
mothers, and young children, to be "sold separately, or in lots to suit
the convenience of the purchaser" and that soul immortal, once bought
with blood and anguish by the Son of God, when the earth shook, and the
rocks rent, and the graves were opened, can be sold, leased, mortgaged,
exchanged for groceries or dry goods, to suit the phases of trade, or
the fancy of the purchaser.
 
It was a day or two after the conversation between Marie and Miss
Ophelia, that Tom, Adolph, and about half a dozen others of the St.
Clare estate, were turned over to the loving kindness of Mr. Skeggs, the
keeper of a depot on  street, to await the auction, next day.
 
Tom had with him quite a sizable trunk full of clothing, as had most
others of them. They were ushered, for the night, into a long room,
where many other men, of all ages, sizes, and shades of complexion, were
assembled, and from which roars of laughter and unthinking merriment
were proceeding.
 
"Ah, ha! thats right. Go it, boys,go it!" said Mr. Skeggs, the
keeper. "My people are always so merry! Sambo, I see!" he said,
speaking approvingly to a burly negro who was performing tricks of low
buffoonery, which occasioned the shouts which Tom had heard.
 
As might be imagined, Tom was in no humor to join these proceedings
and, therefore, setting his trunk as far as possible from the noisy
group, he sat down on it, and leaned his face against the wall.
 
The dealers in the human article make scrupulous and systematic efforts
to promote noisy mirth among them, as a means of drowning reflection,
and rendering them insensible to their condition. The whole object of
the training to which the negro is put, from the time he is sold in
the northern market till he arrives south, is systematically directed
towards making him callous, unthinking, and brutal. The slavedealer
collects his gang in Virginia or Kentucky, and drives them to some
convenient, healthy place,often a watering place,to be fattened.
Here they are fed full daily and, because some incline to pine, a
fiddle is kept commonly going among them, and they are made to dance
daily and he who refuses to be merryin whose soul thoughts of wife,
or child, or home, are too strong for him to be gayis marked as sullen
and dangerous, and subjected to all the evils which the ill will of an
utterly irresponsible and hardened man can inflict upon him. Briskness,
alertness, and cheerfulness of appearance, especially before observers,
are constantly enforced upon them, both by the hope of thereby getting a
good master, and the fear of all that the driver may bring upon them if
they prove unsalable.
 
"What dat ar nigger doin here?" said Sambo, coming up to Tom, after Mr.
Skeggs had left the room. Sambo was a full black, of great size, very
lively, voluble, and full of trick and grimace.
 
"What you doin here?" said Sambo, coming up to Tom, and poking him
facetiously in the side. "Meditatin, eh?"
 
"I am to be sold at the auction tomorrow!" said Tom, quietly.
 
"Sold at auction,haw! haw! boys, ant this yer fun? I wisht I was
gwine that ar way!tell ye, wouldnt I make em laugh? But how is
it,dis yer whole lot gwine tomorrow?" said Sambo, laying his hand
freely on Adolphs shoulder.
 
"Please to let me alone!" said Adolph, fiercely, straightening himself
up, with extreme disgust.
 
"Law, now, boys! dis yers one o yer white niggers,kind o cream
color, ye know, scented!" said he, coming up to Adolph and snuffing. "O
Lor! hed do for a tobaccershop they could keep him to scent snuff!
Lor, hed keep a whole shope agwine,he would!"
 
"I say, keep off, cant you?" said Adolph, enraged.
 
"Lor, now, how touchy we is,we white niggers! Look at us now!" and
Sambo gave a ludicrous imitation of Adolphs manner "heres de airs and
graces. Wes been in a good family, I specs."
 
"Yes," said Adolph "I had a master that could have bought you all for
old truck!"
 
"Laws, now, only think," said Sambo, "the gentlemens that we is!"
 
"I belonged to the St. Clare family," said Adolph, proudly.
 
"Lor, you did! Be hanged if they arnt lucky to get shet of ye. Spects
theys gwine to trade ye off with a lot o cracked teapots and sich
like!" said Sambo, with a provoking grin.
 
Adolph, enraged at this taunt, flew furiously at his adversary, swearing
and striking on every side of him. The rest laughed and shouted, and the
uproar brought the keeper to the door.
 
"What now, boys? Order,order!" he said, coming in and flourishing a
large whip.
 
All fled in different directions, except Sambo, who, presuming on the
favor which the keeper had to him as a licensed wag, stood his ground,
ducking his head with a facetious grin, whenever the master made a dive
at him.
 
"Lor, Masr, tant us,we s reglar stiddy,its these yer new hands
they s real aggravatin,kinder pickin at us, all time!"
 
The keeper, at this, turned upon Tom and Adolph, and distributing a few
kicks and cuffs without much inquiry, and leaving general orders for all
to be good boys and go to sleep, left the apartment.
 
While this scene was going on in the mens sleepingroom, the reader may
be curious to take a peep at the corresponding apartment allotted to
the women. Stretched out in various attitudes over the floor, he may see
numberless sleeping forms of every shade of complexion, from the purest
ebony to white, and of all years, from childhood to old age, lying now
asleep. Here is a fine bright girl, of ten years, whose mother was sold
out yesterday, and who tonight cried herself to sleep when nobody was
looking at her. Here, a worn old negress, whose thin arms and callous
fingers tell of hard toil, waiting to be sold tomorrow, as a castoff
article, for what can be got for her and some forty or fifty others,
with heads variously enveloped in blankets or articles of clothing, lie
stretched around them. But, in a corner, sitting apart from the rest,
are two females of a more interesting appearance than common. One of
these is a respectablydressed mulatto woman between forty and fifty,
with soft eyes and a gentle and pleasing physiognomy. She has on her
head a highraised turban, made of a gay red Madras handkerchief, of the
first quality, her dress is neatly fitted, and of good material, showing
that she has been provided for with a careful hand. By her side, and
nestling closely to her, is a young girl of fifteen,her daughter. She
is a quadroon, as may be seen from her fairer complexion, though her
likeness to her mother is quite discernible. She has the same soft, dark
eye, with longer lashes, and her curling hair is of a luxuriant brown.
She also is dressed with great neatness, and her white, delicate hands
betray very little acquaintance with servile toil. These two are to
be sold tomorrow, in the same lot with the St. Clare servants and the
gentleman to whom they belong, and to whom the money for their sale is
to be transmitted, is a member of a Christian church in New York, who
will receive the money, and go thereafter to the sacrament of his Lord
and theirs, and think no more of it.
 
These two, whom we shall call Susan and Emmeline, had been the personal
attendants of an amiable and pious lady of New Orleans, by whom they had
been carefully and piously instructed and trained. They had been taught
to read and write, diligently instructed in the truths of religion, and
their lot had been as happy an one as in their condition it was possible
to be. But the only son of their protectress had the management of her
property and, by carelessness and extravagance involved it to a
large amount, and at last failed. One of the largest creditors was
the respectable firm of B.  Co., in New York. B.  Co. wrote to their
lawyer in New Orleans, who attached the real estate these two articles
and a lot of plantation hands formed the most valuable part of it, and
wrote word to that effect to New York. Brother B., being, as we have
said, a Christian man, and a resident in a free State, felt some
uneasiness on the subject. He didnt like trading in slaves and souls
of men,of course, he didnt but, then, there were thirty thousand
dollars in the case, and that was rather too much money to be lost for a
principle and so, after much considering, and asking advice from those
that he knew would advise to suit him, Brother B. wrote to his lawyer to
dispose of the business in the way that seemed to him the most suitable,
and remit the proceeds.
 
The day after the letter arrived in New Orleans, Susan and Emmeline
were attached, and sent to the depot to await a general auction on the
following morning and as they glimmer faintly upon us in the moonlight
which steals through the grated window, we may listen to their
conversation. Both are weeping, but each quietly, that the other may not
hear.
 
"Mother, just lay your head on my lap, and see if you cant sleep a
little," says the girl, trying to appear calm.
 
"I havent any heart to sleep, Em I cant its the last night we may
be together!"
 
"O, mother, dont say so! perhaps we shall get sold together,who
knows?"
 
"If t was anybodys else case, I should say so, too, Em," said the
woman "but Im so feard of losin you that I dont see anything but the
danger."
 
"Why, mother, the man said we were both likely, and would sell well."
 
Susan remembered the mans looks and words. With a deadly sickness at
her heart, she remembered how he had looked at Emmelines hands, and
lifted up her curly hair, and pronounced her a firstrate article. Susan
had been trained as a Christian, brought up in the daily reading of the
Bible, and had the same horror of her childs being sold to a life
of shame that any other Christian mother might have but she had no
hope,no protection.
 
"Mother, I think we might do first rate, if you could get a place as
cook, and I as chambermaid or seamstress, in some family. I dare say we
shall. Lets both look as bright and lively as we can, and tell all we
can do, and perhaps we shall," said Emmeline.
 
"I want you to brush your hair all back straight, tomorrow," said Susan.
 
"What for, mother? I dont look near so well, that way."
 
"Yes, but youll sell better so."
 
"I dont see why!" said the child.
 
"Respectable families would be more apt to buy you, if they saw you
looked plain and decent, as if you wasnt trying to look handsome. I
know their ways better n you do," said Susan.
 
"Well, mother, then I will."
 
"And, Emmeline, if we shouldnt ever see each other again, after
tomorrow,if Im sold way up on a plantation somewhere, and you
somewhere else,always remember how youve been brought up, and all
Missis has told you take your Bible with you, and your hymnbook and
if youre faithful to the Lord, hell be faithful to you."
 
So speaks the poor soul, in sore discouragement for she knows
that tomorrow any man, however vile and brutal, however godless and
merciless, if he only has money to pay for her, may become owner of her
daughter, body and soul and then, how is the child to be faithful? She
thinks of all this, as she holds her daughter in her arms, and
wishes that she were not handsome and attractive. It seems almost an
aggravation to her to remember how purely and piously, how much above
the ordinary lot, she has been brought up. But she has no resort but to
_pray_ and many such prayers to God have gone up from those same trim,
neatlyarranged, respectable slaveprisons,prayers which God has not
forgotten, as a coming day shall show for it is written, "Who causeth
one of these little ones to offend, it were better for him that a
millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the
depths of the sea."
 
The soft, earnest, quiet moonbeam looks in fixedly, marking the bars
of the grated windows on the prostrate, sleeping forms. The mother and
daughter are singing together a wild and melancholy dirge, common as a
funeral hymn among the slaves
 
     "O, where is weeping Mary?
     O, where is weeping Mary?
     Rived in the goodly land.
     She is dead and gone to Heaven
     She is dead and gone to Heaven
     Rived in the goodly land."
 
These words, sung by voices of a peculiar and melancholy sweetness, in
an air which seemed like the sighing of earthy despair after heavenly
hope, floated through the dark prison rooms with a pathetic cadence, as
verse after verse was breathed out
 
     "O, where are Paul and Silas?
     O, where are Paul and Silas?
     Gone to the goodly land.
     They are dead and gone to Heaven
     They are dead and gone to Heaven
     Rived in the goodly land."
 
Sing on poor souls! The night is short, and the morning will part you
forever!
 
But now it is morning, and everybody is astir and the worthy Mr. Skeggs
is busy and bright, for a lot of goods is to be fitted out for auction.
There is a brisk lookout on the toilet injunctions passed around
to every one to put on their best face and be spry and now all are
arranged in a circle for a last review, before they are marched up to
the Bourse.
 
Mr. Skeggs, with his palmetto on and his cigar in his mouth, walks
around to put farewell touches on his wares.
 
"Hows this?" he said, stepping in front of Susan and Emmeline. "Wheres
your curls, gal?"
 
The girl looked timidly at her mother, who, with the smooth adroitness
common among her class, answers,
 
"I was telling her, last night, to put up her hair smooth and neat, and
not havin it flying about in curls looks more respectable so."
 
"Bother!" said the man, peremptorily, turning to the girl "you go right
along, and curl yourself real smart!" He added, giving a crack to a
rattan he held in his hand, "And be back in quick time, too!"
 
"You go and help her," he added, to the mother. "Them curls may make a
hundred dollars difference in the sale of her."
 
 
Beneath a splendid dome were men of all nations, moving to and fro,
over the marble pave. On every side of the circular area were little
tribunes, or stations, for the use of speakers and auctioneers. Two of
these, on opposite sides of the area, were now occupied by brilliant and
talented gentlemen, enthusiastically forcing up, in English and French
commingled, the bids of connoisseurs in their various wares. A third
one, on the other side, still unoccupied, was surrounded by a group,
waiting the moment of sale to begin. And here we may recognize the St.
Clare servants,Tom, Adolph, and others and there, too, Susan and
Emmeline, awaiting their turn with anxious and dejected faces. Various
spectators, intending to purchase, or not intending, examining, and
commenting on their various points and faces with the same freedom that
a set of jockeys discuss the merits of a horse.
 
"Hulloa, Alf! what brings you here?" said a young exquisite, slapping
the shoulder of a sprucelydressed young man, who was examining Adolph
through an eyeglass.
 
"Well! I was wanting a valet, and I heard that St. Clares lot was
going. I thought Id just look at his"
 
"Catch me ever buying any of St. Clares people! Spoilt niggers, every
one. Impudent as the devil!" said the other.
 
"Never fear that!" said the first. "If I get em, Ill soon have their
airs out of them theyll soon find that theyve another kind of master
to deal with than Monsieur St. Clare. Pon my word, Ill buy that
fellow. I like the shape of him."
 
"Youll find itll take all youve got to keep him. Hes deucedly
extravagant!"
 
"Yes, but my lord will find that he _cant_ be extravagant with _me_.
Just let him be sent to the calaboose a few times, and thoroughly
dressed down! Ill tell you if it dont bring him to a sense of his
ways! O, Ill reform him, up hill and down,youll see. I buy him,
thats flat!"
 
Tom had been standing wistfully examining the multitude of faces
thronging around him, for one whom he would wish to call master. And if
you should ever be under the necessity, sir, of selecting, out of two
hundred men, one who was to become your absolute owner and disposer, you
would, perhaps, realize, just as Tom did, how few there were that you
would feel at all comfortable in being made over to. Tom saw abundance
of men,great, burly, gruff men little, chirping, dried men
longfavored, lank, hard men and every variety of stubbedlooking,
commonplace men, who pick up their fellowmen as one picks up chips,
putting them into the fire or a basket with equal unconcern, according
to their convenience but he saw no St. Clare.
 
A little before the sale commenced, a short, broad, muscular man, in a
checked shirt considerably open at the bosom, and pantaloons much the
worse for dirt and wear, elbowed his way through the crowd, like one who
is going actively into a business and, coming up to the group, began
to examine them systematically. From the moment that Tom saw him
approaching, he felt an immediate and revolting horror at him, that
increased as he came near. He was evidently, though short, of gigantic
strength. His round, bullet head, large, lightgray eyes, with their
shaggy, sandy eyebrows, and stiff, wiry, sunburned hair, were rather
unprepossessing items, it is to be confessed his large, coarse mouth
was distended with tobacco, the juice of which, from time to time, he
ejected from him with great decision and explosive force his hands
were immensely large, hairy, sunburned, freckled, and very dirty, and
garnished with long nails, in a very foul condition. This man proceeded
to a very free personal examination of the lot. He seized Tom by the
jaw, and pulled open his mouth to inspect his teeth made him strip
up his sleeve, to show his muscle turned him round, made him jump and
spring, to show his paces.
 
"Where was you raised?" he added, briefly, to these investigations.
 
"In Kintuck, Masr," said Tom, looking about, as if for deliverance.
 
"What have you done?"
 
"Had care of Masrs farm," said Tom.
 
"Likely story!" said the other, shortly, as he passed on. He paused a
moment before Dolph then spitting a discharge of tobaccojuice on his
wellblacked boots, and giving a contemptuous umph, he walked on. Again
he stopped before Susan and Emmeline. He put out his heavy, dirty hand,
and drew the girl towards him passed it over her neck and bust, felt
her arms, looked at her teeth, and then pushed her back against her
mother, whose patient face showed the suffering she had been going
through at every motion of the hideous stranger.
 
The girl was frightened, and began to cry.
 
"Stop that, you minx!" said the salesman "no whimpering here,the sale
is going to begin." And accordingly the sale begun.
 
Adolph was knocked off, at a good sum, to the young gentlemen who had
previously stated his intention of buying him and the other servants of
the St. Clare lot went to various bidders.
 
"Now, up with you, boy! dye hear?" said the auctioneer to Tom.
 
Tom stepped upon the block, gave a few anxious looks round all seemed
mingled in a common, indistinct noise,the clatter of the salesman
crying off his qualifications in French and English, the quick fire of
French and English bids and almost in a moment came the final thump
of the hammer, and the clear ring on the last syllable of the word
_"dollars,"_ as the auctioneer announced his price, and Tom was made
over.He had a master!
 
He was pushed from the blockthe short, bulletheaded man seizing
him roughly by the shoulder, pushed him to one side, saying, in a harsh
voice, "Stand there, _you!_"
 
Tom hardly realized anything but still the bidding went on,ratting,
clattering, now French, now English. Down goes the hammer again,Susan
is sold! She goes down from the block, stops, looks wistfully back,her
daughter stretches her hands towards her. She looks with agony in the
face of the man who has bought her,a respectable middleaged man, of
benevolent countenance.
 
"O, Masr, please do buy my daughter!"
 
"Id like to, but Im afraid I cant afford it!" said the gentleman,
looking, with painful interest, as the young girl mounted the block, and
looked around her with a frightened and timid glance.
 
The blood flushes painfully in her otherwise colorless cheek, her eye
has a feverish fire, and her mother groans to see that she looks
more beautiful than she ever saw her before. The auctioneer sees his
advantage, and expatiates volubly in mingled French and English, and
bids rise in rapid succession.
 
"Ill do anything in reason," said the benevolentlooking gentleman,
pressing in and joining with the bids. In a few moments they have run
beyond his purse. He is silent the auctioneer grows warmer but bids
gradually drop off. It lies now between an aristocratic old citizen
and our bulletheaded acquaintance. The citizen bids for a few turns,
contemptuously measuring his opponent but the bullethead has the
advantage over him, both in obstinacy and concealed length of purse, and
the controversy lasts but a moment the hammer falls,he has got the
girl, body and soul, unless God help her!
 
Her master is Mr. Legree, who owns a cotton plantation on the Red River.
She is pushed along into the same lot with Tom and two other men, and
goes off, weeping as she goes.
 
The benevolent gentleman is sorry but, then, the thing happens every
day! One sees girls and mothers crying, at these sales, _always!_ it
cant be helped, c. and he walks off, with his acquisition, in another
direction.
 
Two days after, the lawyer of the Christian firm of B.  Co., New York,
send on their money to them. On the reverse of that draft, so obtained,
let them write these words of the great Paymaster, to whom they shall
make up their account in a future day _"When he maketh inquisition for
blood, he forgetteth not the cry of the humble!"_
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXXI
 
The Middle Passage
 
"Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look upon
iniquity wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously,
and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more
righteous than he?"HAB. 1 13.
 
 
On the lower part of a small, mean boat, on the Red River, Tom
sat,chains on his wrists, chains on his feet, and a weight heavier
than chains lay on his heart. All had faded from his sky,moon and
star all had passed by him, as the trees and banks were now passing,
to return no more. Kentucky home, with wife and children, and indulgent
owners St. Clare home, with all its refinements and splendors the
golden head of Eva, with its saintlike eyes the proud, gay, handsome,
seemingly careless, yet everkind St. Clare hours of ease and indulgent
leisure,all gone! and in place thereof, _what_ remains?
 
It is one of the bitterest apportionments of a lot of slavery, that
the negro, sympathetic and assimilative, after acquiring, in a refined
family, the tastes and feelings which form the atmosphere of such a
place, is not the less liable to become the bondslave of the coarsest
and most brutal,just as a chair or table, which once decorated the
superb saloon, comes, at last, battered and defaced, to the barroom of
some filthy tavern, or some low haunt of vulgar debauchery. The great
difference is, that the table and chair cannot feel, and the _man_ can
for even a legal enactment that he shall be "taken, reputed, adjudged in
law, to be a chattel personal," cannot blot out his soul, with its own
private little world of memories, hopes, loves, fears, and desires.
 
Mr. Simon Legree, Toms master, had purchased slaves at one place
and another, in New Orleans, to the number of eight, and driven them,
handcuffed, in couples of two and two, down to the good steamer Pirate,
which lay at the levee, ready for a trip up the Red River.
 
Having got them fairly on board, and the boat being off, he came round,
with that air of efficiency which ever characterized him, to take a
review of them. Stopping opposite to Tom, who had been attired for sale
in his best broadcloth suit, with wellstarched linen and shining boots,
he briefly expressed himself as follows
 
"Stand up."
 
Tom stood up.
 
"Take off that stock!" and, as Tom, encumbered by his fetters, proceeded
to do it, he assisted him, by pulling it, with no gentle hand, from his
neck, and putting it in his pocket.
 
Legree now turned to Toms trunk, which, previous to this, he had been
ransacking, and, taking from it a pair of old pantaloons and dilapidated
coat, which Tom had been wont to put on about his stablework, he said,
liberating Toms hands from the handcuffs, and pointing to a recess in
among the boxes,
 
"You go there, and put these on."
 
Tom obeyed, and in a few moments returned.
 
"Take off your boots," said Mr. Legree.
 
Tom did so.
 
"There," said the former, throwing him a pair of coarse, stout shoes,
such as were common among the slaves, "put these on."
 
In Toms hurried exchange, he had not forgotten to transfer his
cherished Bible to his pocket. It was well he did so for Mr. Legree,
having refitted Toms handcuffs, proceeded deliberately to investigate
the contents of his pockets. He drew out a silk handkerchief, and put
it into his own pocket. Several little trifles, which Tom had treasured,
chiefly because they had amused Eva, he looked upon with a contemptuous
grunt, and tossed them over his shoulder into the river.
 
Toms Methodist hymnbook, which, in his hurry, he had forgotten, he now
held up and turned over.
 
Humph! pious, to be sure. So, whats yer name,you belong to the
church, eh?"
 
"Yes, Masr," said Tom, firmly.
 
"Well, Ill soon have _that_ out of you. I have none o yer bawling,
praying, singing niggers on my place so remember. Now, mind yourself,"
he said, with a stamp and a fierce glance of his gray eye, directed at
Tom, "_Im_ your church now! You understand,youve got to be as _I_
say."
 
Something within the silent black man answered _No!_ and, as if repeated
by an invisible voice, came the words of an old prophetic scroll, as Eva
had often read them to him,"Fear not! for I have redeemed thee. I have
called thee by name. Thou art MINE!"
 
But Simon Legree heard no voice. That voice is one he never shall hear.
He only glared for a moment on the downcast face of Tom, and walked off.
He took Toms trunk, which contained a very neat and abundant wardrobe,
to the forecastle, where it was soon surrounded by various hands of
the boat. With much laughing, at the expense of niggers who tried to be
gentlemen, the articles very readily were sold to one and another, and
the empty trunk finally put up at auction. It was a good joke, they all
thought, especially to see how Tom looked after his things, as they were
going this way and that and then the auction of the trunk, that was
funnier than all, and occasioned abundant witticisms.
 
This little affair being over, Simon sauntered up again to his property.
 
"Now, Tom, Ive relieved you of any extra baggage, you see. Take mighty
good care of them clothes. Itll be long enough fore you get more. I
go in for making niggers careful one suit has to do for one year, on my
place."
 
Simon next walked up to the place where Emmeline was sitting, chained to
another woman.
 
"Well, my dear," he said, chucking her under the chin, "keep up your
spirits."
 
The involuntary look of horror, fright and aversion, with which the girl
regarded him, did not escape his eye. He frowned fiercely.
 
"None o your shines, gal! yous got to keep a pleasant face, when I
speak to ye,dye hear? And you, you old yellow poco moonshine!" he
said, giving a shove to the mulatto woman to whom Emmeline was chained,
"dont you carry that sort of face! Yous got to look chipper, I tell
ye!"
 
"I say, all on ye," he said retreating a pace or two back, "look at
me,look at me,look me right in the eye,_straight_, now!" said he,
stamping his foot at every pause.
 
As by a fascination, every eye was now directed to the glaring
greenishgray eye of Simon.
 
"Now," said he, doubling his great, heavy fist into something resembling
a blacksmiths hammer, "dye see this fist? Heft it!" he said, bringing
it down on Toms hand. "Look at these yer bones! Well, I tell ye this
yer fist has got as hard as iron _knocking down niggers_. I never
see the nigger, yet, I couldnt bring down with one crack," said he,
bringing his fist down so near to the face of Tom that he winked and
drew back. "I dont keep none o yer cussed overseers I does my own
overseeing and I tell you things _is_ seen to. Yous every one on ye
got to toe the mark, I tell ye quick,straight,the moment I speak.
Thats the way to keep in with me. Ye wont find no soft spot in me,
nowhere. So, now, mind yerselves for I dont show no mercy!"
 
The women involuntarily drew in their breath, and the whole gang sat
with downcast, dejected faces. Meanwhile, Simon turned on his heel, and
marched up to the bar of the boat for a dram.
 
"Thats the way I begin with my niggers," he said, to a gentlemanly
man, who had stood by him during his speech. "Its my system to begin
strong,just let em know what to expect."
 
"Indeed!" said the stranger, looking upon him with the curiosity of a
naturalist studying some outoftheway specimen.
 
"Yes, indeed. Im none o yer gentlemen planters, with lily fingers, to
slop round and be cheated by some old cuss of an overseer! Just feel
of my knuckles, now look at my fist. Tell ye, sir, the flesh on t has
come jest like a stone, practising on niggerfeel on it."
 
The stranger applied his fingers to the implement in question, and
simply said,
 
"T is hard enough and, I suppose," he added, "practice has made your
heart just like it."
 
"Why, yes, I may say so," said Simon, with a hearty laugh. "I reckon
theres as little soft in me as in any one going. Tell you, nobody comes
it over me! Niggers never gets round me, neither with squalling nor soft
soap,thats a fact."
 
"You have a fine lot there."
 
"Real," said Simon. "Theres that Tom, they telled me he was suthin
uncommon. I paid a little high for him, tendin him for a driver and a
managing chap only get the notions out that hes larnt by bein treated
as niggers never ought to be, hell do prime! The yellow woman I got
took in on. I rayther think shes sickly, but I shall put her through
for what shes worth she may last a year or two. I dont go for savin
niggers. Use up, and buy more, s my waymakes you less trouble, and
Im quite sure it comes cheaper in the end" and Simon sipped his glass.
 
"And how long do they generally last?" said the stranger.
 
"Well, donno cordin as their constitution is. Stout fellers last six
or seven years trashy ones gets worked up in two or three. I used to,
when I fust begun, have considerable trouble fussin with em and trying
to make em hold out,doctorin on em up when theys sick, and givin
on em clothes and blankets, and what not, tryin to keep em all sort
o decent and comfortable. Law, t wasnt no sort o use I lost money
on em, and t was heaps o trouble. Now, you see, I just put em
straight through, sick or well. When one niggers dead, I buy another
and I find it comes cheaper and easier, every way."
 
The stranger turned away, and seated himself beside a gentleman, who had
been listening to the conversation with repressed uneasiness.
 
"You must not take that fellow to be any specimen of Southern planters,"
said he.
 
"I should hope not," said the young gentleman, with emphasis.
 
"He is a mean, low, brutal fellow!" said the other.
 
"And yet your laws allow him to hold any number of human beings subject
to his absolute will, without even a shadow of protection and, low as
he is, you cannot say that there are not many such."
 
"Well," said the other, "there are also many considerate and humane men
among planters."
 
"Granted," said the young man "but, in my opinion, it is you
considerate, humane men, that are responsible for all the brutality
and outrage wrought by these wretches because, if it were not for your
sanction and influence, the whole system could not keep foothold for
an hour. If there were no planters except such as that one," said he,
pointing with his finger to Legree, who stood with his back to
them, "the whole thing would go down like a millstone. It is your
respectability and humanity that licenses and protects his brutality."
 
"You certainly have a high opinion of my good nature," said the planter,
smiling, "but I advise you not to talk quite so loud, as there are
people on board the boat who might not be quite so tolerant to opinion
as I am. You had better wait till I get up to my plantation, and there
you may abuse us all, quite at your leisure."
 
The young gentleman colored and smiled, and the two were soon busy in a
game of backgammon. Meanwhile, another conversation was going on in the
lower part of the boat, between Emmeline and the mulatto woman with whom
she was confined. As was natural, they were exchanging with each other
some particulars of their history.
 
"Who did you belong to?" said Emmeline.
 
"Well, my Masr was Mr. Ellis,lived on Leveestreet. Praps youve
seen the house."
 
"Was he good to you?" said Emmeline.
 
"Mostly, till he tuk sick. Hes lain sick, off and on, more than six
months, and been orful oneasy. Pears like he warnt willin to have
nobody rest, day or night and got so curous, there couldnt nobody suit
him. Pears like he just grew crosser, every day kep me up nights till
I got farly beat out, and couldnt keep awake no longer and cause I got
to sleep, one night, Lors, he talk so orful to me, and he tell me hed
sell me to just the hardest master he could find and hed promised me
my freedom, too, when he died."
 
"Had you any friends?" said Emmeline.
 
"Yes, my husband,hes a blacksmith. Masr genly hired him out. They
took me off so quick, I didnt even have time to see him and Is got
four children. O, dear me!" said the woman, covering her face with her
hands.
 
It is a natural impulse, in every one, when they hear a tale of
distress, to think of something to say by way of consolation. Emmeline
wanted to say something, but she could not think of anything to say.
What was there to be said? As by a common consent, they both avoided,
with fear and dread, all mention of the horrible man who was now their
master.
 
True, there is religious trust for even the darkest hour. The mulatto
woman was a member of the Methodist church, and had an unenlightened
but very sincere spirit of piety. Emmeline had been educated much more
intelligently,taught to read and write, and diligently instructed in
the Bible, by the care of a faithful and pious mistress yet, would
it not try the faith of the firmest Christian, to find themselves
abandoned, apparently, of God, in the grasp of ruthless violence? How
much more must it shake the faith of Christs poor little ones, weak in
knowledge and tender in years!
 
The boat moved on,freighted with its weight of sorrow,up the red,
muddy, turbid current, through the abrupt tortuous windings of the Red
river and sad eyes gazed wearily on the steep redclay banks, as they
glided by in dreary sameness. At last the boat stopped at a small town,
and Legree, with his party, disembarked.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXXII
 
Dark Places
 
 
"The dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty."
 
      Ps. 7420.
 
Trailing wearily behind a rude wagon, and over a ruder road, Tom and his
associates faced onward.
 
In the wagon was seated Simon Legree and the two women, still fettered
together, were stowed away with some baggage in the back part of it,
and the whole company were seeking Legrees plantation, which lay a good
distance off.
 
It was a wild, forsaken road, now winding through dreary pine barrens,
where the wind whispered mournfully, and now over log causeways, through
long cypress swamps, the doleful trees rising out of the slimy, spongy
ground, hung with long wreaths of funeral black moss, while ever and
anon the loathsome form of the mocassin snake might be seen sliding
among broken stumps and shattered branches that lay here and there,
rotting in the water.
 
It is disconsolate enough, this riding, to the stranger, who, with
wellfilled pocket and wellappointed horse, threads the lonely way on
some errand of business but wilder, drearier, to the man enthralled,
whom every weary step bears further from all that man loves and prays
for.
 
So one should have thought, that witnessed the sunken and dejected
expression on those dark faces the wistful, patient weariness with
which those sad eyes rested on object after object that passed them in
their sad journey.
 
Simon rode on, however, apparently well pleased, occasionally pulling
away at a flask of spirit, which he kept in his pocket.
 
"I say, _you!_" he said, as he turned back and caught a glance at the
dispirited faces behind him. "Strike up a song, boys,come!"
 
The men looked at each other, and the "_come_" was repeated, with a
smart crack of the whip which the driver carried in his hands. Tom began
a Methodist hymn.
 
     "Jerusalem, my happy home,
     Name ever dear to me!
     When shall my sorrows have an end,
     Thy joys when shall"
 
      "_Jerusalem, my happy home_," anonymous hymn dating from
     the latter part of the sixteenth century, sung to the tune
     of "St. Stephen."  Words derive from St. Augustines
     _Meditations_.
 
"Shut up, you black cuss!" roared Legree "did ye think I wanted any
o yer infernal old Methodism? I say, tune up, now, something real
rowdy,quick!"
 
One of the other men struck up one of those unmeaning songs, common
among the slaves.
 
     "Masr seed me cotch a coon,
     High boys, high!
     He laughed to split,dye see the moon,
     Ho! ho! ho! boys, ho!
     Ho! yo! hie! _oh!"_
 
The singer appeared to make up the song to his own pleasure, generally
hitting on rhyme, without much attempt at reason and the party took up
the chorus, at intervals,
 
     "Ho! ho! ho! boys, ho!
     Higheoh! higheoh!"
 
It was sung very boisterouly, and with a forced attempt at merriment
but no wail of despair, no words of impassioned prayer, could have had
such a depth of woe in them as the wild notes of the chorus. As if
the poor, dumb heart, threatened,prisoned,took refuge in that
inarticulate sanctuary of music, and found there a language in which to
breathe its prayer to God! There was a prayer in it, which Simon could
not hear. He only heard the boys singing noisily, and was well pleased
he was making them "keep up their spirits."
 
"Well, my little dear," said he, turning to Emmeline, and laying his
hand on her shoulder, "were almost home!"
 
When Legree scolded and stormed, Emmeline was terrified but when he
laid his hand on her, and spoke as he now did, she felt as if she had
rather he would strike her. The expression of his eyes made her soul
sick, and her flesh creep. Involuntarily she clung closer to the mulatto
woman by her side, as if she were her mother.
 
"You didnt ever wear earrings," he said, taking hold of her small ear
with his coarse fingers.
 
"No, Masr!" said Emmeline, trembling and looking down.
 
"Well, Ill give you a pair, when we get home, if youre a good girl.
You neednt be so frightened I dont mean to make you work very hard.
Youll have fine times with me, and live like a lady,only be a good
girl."
 
Legree had been drinking to that degree that he was inclining to be
very gracious and it was about this time that the enclosures of the
plantation rose to view. The estate had formerly belonged to a gentleman
of opulence and taste, who had bestowed some considerable attention
to the adornment of his grounds. Having died insolvent, it had been
purchased, at a bargain, by Legree, who used it, as he did everything
else, merely as an implement for moneymaking. The place had that
ragged, forlorn appearance, which is always produced by the evidence
that the care of the former owner has been left to go to utter decay.
 
What was once a smoothshaven lawn before the house, dotted here and
there with ornamental shrubs, was now covered with frowsy tangled
grass, with horseposts set up, here and there, in it, where the turf was
stamped away, and the ground littered with broken pails, cobs of corn,
and other slovenly remains. Here and there, a mildewed jessamine or
honeysuckle hung raggedly from some ornamental support, which had been
pushed to one side by being used as a horsepost. What once was a large
garden was now all grown over with weeds, through which, here and
there, some solitary exotic reared its forsaken head. What had been a
conservatory had now no windowshades, and on the mouldering shelves
stood some dry, forsaken flowerpots, with sticks in them, whose dried
leaves showed they had once been plants.
 
The wagon rolled up a weedy gravel walk, under a noble avenue of China
trees, whose graceful forms and everspringing foliage seemed to be the
only things there that neglect could not daunt or alter,like noble
spirits, so deeply rooted in goodness, as to flourish and grow stronger
amid discouragement and decay.
 
The house had been large and handsome. It was built in a manner common
at the South a wide verandah of two stories running round every part
of the house, into which every outer door opened, the lower tier being
supported by brick pillars.
 
But the place looked desolate and uncomfortable some windows stopped up
with boards, some with shattered panes, and shutters hanging by a single
hinge,all telling of coarse neglect and discomfort.
 
Bits of board, straw, old decayed barrels and boxes, garnished the
ground in all directions and three or four ferociouslooking dogs,
roused by the sound of the wagonwheels, came tearing out, and were with
difficulty restrained from laying hold of Tom and his companions, by the
effort of the ragged servants who came after them.
 
"Ye see what yed get!" said Legree, caressing the dogs with grim
satisfaction, and turning to Tom and his companions. "Ye see what yed
get, if ye try to run off. These yer dogs has been raised to track
niggers and theyd jest as soon chaw one on ye up as eat their supper.
So, mind yerself! How now, Sambo!" he said, to a ragged fellow, without
any brim to his hat, who was officious in his attentions. "How have
things been going?"
 
"Fust rate, Masr."
 
"Quimbo," said Legree to another, who was making zealous demonstrations
to attract his attention, "ye minded what I telled ye?"
 
"Guess I did, didnt I?"
 
These two colored men were the two principal hands on the plantation.
Legree had trained them in savageness and brutality as systematically
as he had his bulldogs and, by long practice in hardness and cruelty,
brought their whole nature to about the same range of capacities. It is
a common remark, and one that is thought to militate strongly against
the character of the race, that the negro overseer is always more
tyrannical and cruel than the white one. This is simply saying that the
negro mind has been more crushed and debased than the white. It is no
more true of this race than of every oppressed race, the world over. The
slave is always a tyrant, if he can get a chance to be one.
 
Legree, like some potentates we read of in history, governed his
plantation by a sort of resolution of forces. Sambo and Quimbo cordially
hated each other the plantation hands, one and all, cordially hated
them and, by playing off one against another, he was pretty sure,
through one or the other of the three parties, to get informed of
whatever was on foot in the place.
 
Nobody can live entirely without social intercourse and Legree
encouraged his two black satellites to a kind of coarse familiarity with
him,a familiarity, however, at any moment liable to get one or the
other of them into trouble for, on the slightest provocation, one of
them always stood ready, at a nod, to be a minister of his vengeance on
the other.
 
As they stood there now by Legree, they seemed an apt illustration of
the fact that brutal men are lower even than animals. Their coarse,
dark, heavy features their great eyes, rolling enviously on each other
their barbarous, guttural, halfbrute intonation their dilapidated
garments fluttering in the wind,were all in admirable keeping with the
vile and unwholesome character of everything about the place.
 
"Here, you Sambo," said Legree, "take these yer boys down to the
quarters and heres a gal Ive got for _you_," said he, as he separated
the mulatto woman from Emmeline, and pushed her towards him"I
promised to bring you one, you know."
 
The woman gave a start, and drawing back, said, suddenly,
 
"O, Masr! I left my old man in New Orleans."
 
"What of that, you wont you want one here? None o your words,go
long!" said Legree, raising his whip.
 
"Come, mistress," he said to Emmeline, "you go in here with me."
 
A dark, wild face was seen, for a moment, to glance at the window of the
house and, as Legree opened the door, a female voice said something, in
a quick, imperative tone. Tom, who was looking, with anxious interest,
after Emmeline, as she went in, noticed this, and heard Legree answer,
angrily, "You may hold your tongue! Ill do as I please, for all you!"
 
Tom heard no more for he was soon following Sambo to the quarters. The
quarters was a little sort of street of rude shanties, in a row, in
a part of the plantation, far off from the house. They had a forlorn,
brutal, forsaken air. Toms heart sunk when he saw them. He had been
comforting himself with the thought of a cottage, rude, indeed, but one
which he might make neat and quiet, and where he might have a shelf for
his Bible, and a place to be alone out of his laboring hours. He looked
into several they were mere rude shells, destitute of any species of
furniture, except a heap of straw, foul with dirt, spread confusedly
over the floor, which was merely the bare ground, trodden hard by the
tramping of innumerable feet.
 
"Which of these will be mine?" said he, to Sambo, submissively.
 
"Dunno ken turn in here, I spose," said Sambo "spects thars room for
another thar thars a pretty smart heap o niggers to each on em, now
sure, I dunno what I s to do with more."
 
 
It was late in the evening when the weary occupants of the shanties came
flocking home,men and women, in soiled and tattered garments, surly
and uncomfortable, and in no mood to look pleasantly on newcomers. The
small village was alive with no inviting sounds hoarse, guttural voices
contending at the handmills where their morsel of hard corn was yet to
be ground into meal, to fit it for the cake that was to constitute their
only supper. From the earliest dawn of the day, they had been in the
fields, pressed to work under the driving lash of the overseers for it
was now in the very heat and hurry of the season, and no means was left
untried to press every one up to the top of their capabilities. "True,"
says the negligent lounger "picking cotton isnt hard work." Isnt it?
And it isnt much inconvenience, either, to have one drop of water fall
on your head yet the worst torture of the inquisition is produced by
drop after drop, drop after drop, falling moment after moment, with
monotonous succession, on the same spot and work, in itself not
hard, becomes so, by being pressed, hour after hour, with unvarying,
unrelenting sameness, with not even the consciousness of freewill to
take from its tediousness. Tom looked in vain among the gang, as they
poured along, for companionable faces. He saw only sullen, scowling,
imbruted men, and feeble, discouraged women, or women that were not
women,the strong pushing away the weak,the gross, unrestricted
animal selfishness of human beings, of whom nothing good was expected
and desired and who, treated in every way like brutes, had sunk as
nearly to their level as it was possible for human beings to do. To a
late hour in the night the sound of the grinding was protracted for the
mills were few in number compared with the grinders, and the weary and
feeble ones were driven back by the strong, and came on last in their
turn.
 
"Ho yo!" said Sambo, coming to the mulatto woman, and throwing down a
bag of corn before her "what a cuss yo name?"
 
"Lucy," said the woman.
 
"Wal, Lucy, yo my woman now. Yo grind dis yer corn, and get _my_ supper
baked, ye har?"
 
"I ant your woman, and I wont be!" said the woman, with the sharp,
sudden courage of despair "you go long!"
 
"Ill kick yo, then!" said Sambo, raising his foot threateningly.
 
"Ye may kill me, if ye choose,the sooner the better! Wisht I was
dead!" said she.
 
"I say, Sambo, you go to spilin the hands, Ill tell Masr o you,"
said Quimbo, who was busy at the mill, from which he had viciously
driven two or three tired women, who were waiting to grind their corn.
 
"And, Ill tell him ye wont let the women come to the mills, yo old
nigger!" said Sambo. "Yo jes keep to yo own row."
 
Tom was hungry with his days journey, and almost faint for want of
food.
 
"Thar, yo!" said Quimbo, throwing down a coarse bag, which contained
a peck of corn "thar, nigger, grab, take car on t,yo wont get no
more, _dis_ yer week."
 
Tom waited till a late hour, to get a place at the mills and then,
moved by the utter weariness of two women, whom he saw trying to grind
their corn there, he ground for them, put together the decaying brands
of the fire, where many had baked cakes before them, and then went about
getting his own supper. It was a new kind of work there,a deed of
charity, small as it was but it woke an answering touch in their
hearts,an expression of womanly kindness came over their hard faces
they mixed his cake for him, and tended its baking and Tom sat down
by the light of the fire, and drew out his Bible,for he had need for
comfort.
 
"Whats that?" said one of the woman.
 
"A Bible," said Tom.
 
"Good Lord! hant seen un since I was in Kentuck."
 
"Was you raised in Kentuck?" said Tom, with interest.
 
"Yes, and well raised, too never spected to come to dis yer!" said the
woman, sighing.
 
"Whats dat ar book, any way?" said the other woman.
 
"Why, the Bible."
 
"Laws a me! whats dat?" said the woman.
 
"Do tell! you never hearn on t?" said the other woman. "I used to har
Missis a readin on t, sometimes, in Kentuck but, laws o me! we dont
har nothin here but crackin and swarin."
 
"Read a piece, anyways!" said the first woman, curiously, seeing Tom
attentively poring over it.
 
Tom read,"Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I
will give you rest."
 
"Thems good words, enough," said the woman "who says em?"
 
"The Lord," said Tom.
 
"I jest wish I knowd whar to find Him," said the woman. "I would go
pears like I never should get rested again. My flesh is fairly sore,
and I tremble all over, every day, and Sambos allers a jawin at me,
cause I doesnt pick faster and nights its most midnight fore I can
get my supper and den pears like I dont turn over and shut my eyes,
fore I hear de horn blow to get up, and at it agin in de mornin. If I
knew whar de Lor was, Id tell him."
 
"Hes here, hes everywhere," said Tom.
 
"Lor, you ant gwine to make me believe dat ar! I know de Lord ant
here," said the woman "tant no use talking, though. Is jest gwine to
camp down, and sleep while I ken."
 
The women went off to their cabins, and Tom sat alone, by the
smouldering fire, that flickered up redly in his face.
 
The silver, fairbrowed moon rose in the purple sky, and looked
down, calm and silent, as God looks on the scene of misery and
oppression,looked calmly on the lone black man, as he sat, with his
arms folded, and his Bible on his knee.
 
"Is God HERE?" Ah, how is it possible for the untaught heart to keep its
faith, unswerving, in the face of dire misrule, and palpable, unrebuked
injustice? In that simple heart waged a fierce conflict the crushing
sense of wrong, the foreshadowing, of a whole life of future misery, the
wreck of all past hopes, mournfully tossing in the souls sight, like
dead corpses of wife, and child, and friend, rising from the dark wave,
and surging in the face of the halfdrowned mariner! Ah, was it easy
_here_ to believe and hold fast the great password of Christian faith,
that "God IS, and is the REWARDER of them that diligently seek Him"?
 
Tom rose, disconsolate, and stumbled into the cabin that had been
allotted to him. The floor was already strewn with weary sleepers, and
the foul air of the place almost repelled him but the heavy nightdews
were chill, and his limbs weary, and, wrapping about him a tattered
blanket, which formed his only bedclothing, he stretched himself in the
straw and fell asleep.
 
In dreams, a gentle voice came over his ear he was sitting on the mossy
seat in the garden by Lake Pontchartrain, and Eva, with her serious eyes
bent downward, was reading to him from the Bible and he heard her read.
 
"When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee, and the
rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire,
thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee for
I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour."
 
Gradually the words seemed to melt and fade, as in a divine music the
child raised her deep eyes, and fixed them lovingly on him, and rays
of warmth and comfort seemed to go from them to his heart and, as if
wafted on the music, she seemed to rise on shining wings, from which
flakes and spangles of gold fell off like stars, and she was gone.
 
Tom woke. Was it a dream? Let it pass for one. But who shall say that
that sweet young spirit, which in life so yearned to comfort and console
the distressed, was forbidden of God to assume this ministry after
death?
 
     It is a beautiful belief,
     That ever round our head
     Are hovering, on angel wings,
     The spirits of the dead.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXXIII
 
Cassy
 
 
"And behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no
comforter and on the side of their oppressors there was power, but they
had no comforter."ECCL. 41
 
It took but a short time to familiarize Tom with all that was to be
hoped or feared in his new way of life. He was an expert and efficient
workman in whatever he undertook and was, both from habit and
principle, prompt and faithful. Quiet and peaceable in his disposition,
he hoped, by unremitting diligence, to avert from himself at least a
portion of the evils of his condition. He saw enough of abuse and misery
to make him sick and weary but he determined to toil on, with religious
patience, committing himself to Him that judgeth righteously, not
without hope that some way of escape might yet be opened to him.
 
Legree took a silent note of Toms availability. He rated him as a
firstclass hand and yet he felt a secret dislike to him,the native
antipathy of bad to good. He saw, plainly, that when, as was often the
case, his violence and brutality fell on the helpless, Tom took notice
of it for, so subtle is the atmosphere of opinion, that it will make
itself felt, without words and the opinion even of a slave may annoy
a master. Tom in various ways manifested a tenderness of feeling, a
commiseration for his fellowsufferers, strange and new to them, which
was watched with a jealous eye by Legree. He had purchased Tom with a
view of eventually making him a sort of overseer, with whom he might,
at times, intrust his affairs, in short absences and, in his view,
the first, second, and third requisite for that place, was _hardness_.
Legree made up his mind, that, as Tom was not hard to his hand, he
would harden him forthwith and some few weeks after Tom had been on the
place, he determined to commence the process.
 
One morning, when the hands were mustered for the field, Tom noticed,
with surprise, a new comer among them, whose appearance excited his
attention. It was a woman, tall and slenderly formed, with remarkably
delicate hands and feet, and dressed in neat and respectable garments.
By the appearance of her face, she might have been between thirtyfive
and forty and it was a face that, once seen, could never be
forgotten,one of those that, at a glance, seem to convey to us an idea
of a wild, painful, and romantic history. Her forehead was high, and
her eyebrows marked with beautiful clearness. Her straight, wellformed
nose, her finelycut mouth, and the graceful contour of her head and
neck, showed that she must once have been beautiful but her face was
deeply wrinkled with lines of pain, and of proud and bitter endurance.
Her complexion was sallow and unhealthy, her cheeks thin, her features
sharp, and her whole form emaciated. But her eye was the most remarkable
feature,so large, so heavily black, overshadowed by long lashes of
equal darkness, and so wildly, mournfully despairing. There was a fierce
pride and defiance in every line of her face, in every curve of the
flexible lip, in every motion of her body but in her eye was a deep,
settled night of anguish,an expression so hopeless and unchanging as
to contrast fearfully with the scorn and pride expressed by her whole
demeanor.
 
Where she came from, or who she was, Tom did not know. The first he did
know, she was walking by his side, erect and proud, in the dim gray
of the dawn. To the gang, however, she was known for there was much
looking and turning of heads, and a smothered yet apparent exultation
among the miserable, ragged, halfstarved creatures by whom she was
surrounded.
 
"Got to come to it, at last,glad of it!" said one.
 
"He! he! he!" said another "youll know how good it is, Misse!"
 
"Well see her work!"
 
"Wonder if shell get a cutting up, at night, like the rest of us!"
 
"Id be glad to see her down for a flogging, Ill bound!" said another.
 
The woman took no notice of these taunts, but walked on, with the same
expression of angry scorn, as if she heard nothing. Tom had always lived
among refined, and cultivated people, and he felt intuitively, from her
air and bearing, that she belonged to that class but how or why she
could be fallen to those degrading circumstances, he could not tell. The
women neither looked at him nor spoke to him, though, all the way to the
field, she kept close at his side.
 
Tom was soon busy at his work but, as the woman was at no great
distance from him, he often glanced an eye to her, at her work. He saw,
at a glance, that a native adroitness and handiness made the task to
her an easier one than it proved to many. She picked very fast and very
clean, and with an air of scorn, as if she despised both the work and
the disgrace and humiliation of the circumstances in which she was
placed.
 
In the course of the day, Tom was working near the mulatto woman who
had been bought in the same lot with himself. She was evidently in a
condition of great suffering, and Tom often heard her praying, as she
wavered and trembled, and seemed about to fall down. Tom silently as he
came near to her, transferred several handfuls of cotton from his own
sack to hers.
 
"O, dont, dont!" said the woman, looking surprised "itll get you
into trouble."
 
Just then Sambo came up. He seemed to have a special spite against this
woman and, flourishing his whip, said, in brutal, guttural tones, "What
dis yer, Luce,foolin a" and, with the word, kicking the woman with
his heavy cowhide shoe, he struck Tom across the face with his whip.
 
Tom silently resumed his task but the woman, before at the last point
of exhaustion, fainted.
 
"Ill bring her to!" said the driver, with a brutal grin. "Ill give her
something better than camphire!" and, taking a pin from his coatsleeve,
he buried it to the head in her flesh. The woman groaned, and half rose.
"Get up, you beast, and work, will yer, or Ill show yer a trick more!"
 
The woman seemed stimulated, for a few moments, to an unnatural
strength, and worked with desperate eagerness.
 
"See that you keep to dat ar," said the man, "or yerll wish yers dead
tonight, I reckin!"
 
"That I do now!" Tom heard her say and again he heard her say, "O,
Lord, how long! O, Lord, why dont you help us?"
 
At the risk of all that he might suffer, Tom came forward again, and put
all the cotton in his sack into the womans.
 
"O, you mustnt! you donno what theyll do to ye!" said the woman.
 
"I can bar it!" said Tom, "better n you" and he was at his place
again. It passed in a moment.
 
Suddenly, the stranger woman whom we have described, and who had, in the
course of her work, come near enough to hear Toms last words, raised
her heavy black eyes, and fixed them, for a second, on him then, taking
a quantity of cotton from her basket, she placed it in his.
 
"You know nothing about this place," she said, "or you wouldnt have
done that. When youve been here a month, youll be done helping
anybody youll find it hard enough to take care of your own skin!"
 
"The Lord forbid, Missis!" said Tom, using instinctively to his field
companion the respectful form proper to the high bred with whom he had
lived.
 
"The Lord never visits these parts," said the woman, bitterly, as she
went nimbly forward with her work and again the scornful smile curled
her lips.
 
But the action of the woman had been seen by the driver, across the
field and, flourishing his whip, he came up to her.
 
"What! what!" he said to the woman, with an air of triumph, "You a
foolin? Go along! yer under me now,mind yourself, or yerll cotch
it!"
 
A glance like sheetlightning suddenly flashed from those black eyes
and, facing about, with quivering lip and dilated nostrils, she drew
herself up, and fixed a glance, blazing with rage and scorn, on the
driver.
 
"Dog!" she said, "touch _me_, if you dare! Ive power enough, yet, to
have you torn by the dogs, burnt alive, cut to inches! Ive only to say
the word!"
 
"What de devil you here for, den?" said the man, evidently cowed, and
sullenly retreating a step or two. "Didnt mean no harm, Misse Cassy!"
 
"Keep your distance, then!" said the woman. And, in truth, the man
seemed greatly inclined to attend to something at the other end of the
field, and started off in quick time.
 
The woman suddenly turned to her work, and labored with a despatch that
was perfectly astonishing to Tom. She seemed to work by magic. Before
the day was through, her basket was filled, crowded down, and piled, and
she had several times put largely into Toms. Long after dusk, the
whole weary train, with their baskets on their heads, defiled up to the
building appropriated to the storing and weighing the cotton. Legree was
there, busily conversing with the two drivers.
 
"Dat ar Toms gwine to make a powerful deal o trouble kept a puttin
into Lucys basket.One o these yer dat will get all der niggers to
feelin bused, if Masir dont watch him!" said Sambo.
 
"Heydey! The black cuss!" said Legree. "Hell have to get a breakin
in, wont he, boys?"
 
Both negroes grinned a horrid grin, at this intimation.
 
"Ay, ay! Let Masr Legree alone, for breakin in! De debil heself
couldnt beat Masr at dat!" said Quimbo.
 
"Wal, boys, the best way is to give him the flogging to do, till he gets
over his notions. Break him in!"
 
"Lord, Masrll have hard work to get dat out o him!"
 
"Itll have to come out of him, though!" said Legree, as he rolled his
tobacco in his mouth.
 
"Now, dars Lucy,de aggravatinest, ugliest wench on de place!" pursued
Sambo.
 
"Take care, Sam I shall begin to think whats the reason for your spite
agin Lucy."
 
"Well, Masr knows she sot herself up agin Masr, and wouldnt have me,
when he telled her to."
 
"Id a flogged her into t," said Legree, spitting, "only theres such a
press o work, it dont seem wuth a while to upset her jist now. Shes
slender but these yer slender gals will bear half killin to get their
own way!"
 
"Wal, Lucy was real aggravatin and lazy, sulkin round wouldnt do
nothin,and Tom he stuck up for her."
 
"He did, eh! Wal, then, Tom shall have the pleasure of flogging her.
Itll be a good practice for him, and he wont put it on to the gal like
you devils, neither."
 
"Ho, ho! haw! haw! haw!" laughed both the sooty wretches and the
diabolical sounds seemed, in truth, a not unapt expression of the
fiendish character which Legree gave them.
 
"Wal, but, Masr, Tom and Misse Cassy, and dey among em, filled Lucys
basket. I ruther guess der weight s in it, Masr!"
 
"_I do the weighing!_" said Legree, emphatically.
 
Both the drivers again laughed their diabolical laugh.
 
"So!" he added, "Misse Cassy did her days work."
 
"She picks like de debil and all his angels!"
 
"Shes got em all in her, I believe!" said Legree and, growling a
brutal oath, he proceeded to the weighingroom.
 
 
Slowly the weary, dispirited creatures, wound their way into the room,
and, with crouching reluctance, presented their baskets to be weighed.
 
Legree noted on a slate, on the side of which was pasted a list of
names, the amount.
 
Toms basket was weighed and approved and he looked, with an anxious
glance, for the success of the woman he had befriended.
 
Tottering with weakness, she came forward, and delivered her basket. It
was of full weight, as Legree well perceived but, affecting anger, he
said,
 
"What, you lazy beast! short again! stand aside, youll catch it, pretty
soon!"
 
The woman gave a groan of utter despair, and sat down on a board.
 
The person who had been called Misse Cassy now came forward, and, with
a haughty, negligent air, delivered her basket. As she delivered it,
Legree looked in her eyes with a sneering yet inquiring glance.
 
She fixed her black eyes steadily on him, her lips moved slightly, and
she said something in French. What it was, no one knew but Legrees
face became perfectly demoniacal in its expression, as she spoke he
half raised his hand, as if to strike,a gesture which she regarded
with fierce disdain, as she turned and walked away.
 
"And now," said Legree, "come here, you Tom. You see, I telled ye I
didnt buy ye jest for the common work I mean to promote ye, and make a
driver of ye and tonight ye may jest as well begin to get yer hand in.
Now, ye jest take this yer gal and flog her yeve seen enough ont to
know how."
 
"I beg Masrs pardon," said Tom "hopes Masr wont set me at that. Its
what I ant used to,never did,and cant do, no way possible."
 
"Yell larn a pretty smart chance of things ye never did know, before
Ive done with ye!" said Legree, taking up a cowhide, and striking Tom a
heavy blow cross the cheek, and following up the infliction by a shower
of blows.
 
"There!" he said, as he stopped to rest "now, will ye tell me ye cant
do it?"
 
"Yes, Masr," said Tom, putting up his hand, to wipe the blood, that
trickled down his face. "Im willin to work, night and day, and work
while theres life and breath in me but this yer thing I cant feel it
right to doand, Masr, I _never_ shall do it,_never_!"
 
Tom had a remarkably smooth, soft voice, and a habitually respectful
manner, that had given Legree an idea that he would be cowardly, and
easily subdued. When he spoke these last words, a thrill of amazement
went through every one the poor woman clasped her hands, and said,
"O Lord!" and every one involuntarily looked at each other and drew in
their breath, as if to prepare for the storm that was about to burst.
 
Legree looked stupefied and confounded but at last burst forth,"What!
ye blasted black beast! tell _me_ ye dont think it _right_ to do what
I tell ye! What have any of you cussed cattle to do with thinking whats
right? Ill put a stop to it! Why, what do ye think ye are? May be ye
think yer a gentleman master, Tom, to be a telling your master whats
right, and what aint! So you pretend its wrong to flog the gal!"
 
"I think so, Masr," said Tom "the poor critturs sick and feeble t
would be downright cruel, and its what I never will do, nor begin to.
Masr, if you mean to kill me, kill me but, as to my raising my hand
agin any one here, I never shall,Ill die first!"
 
Tom spoke in a mild voice, but with a decision that could not be
mistaken. Legree shook with anger his greenish eyes glared fiercely,
and his very whiskers seemed to curl with passion but, like some
ferocious beast, that plays with its victim before he devours it, he
kept back his strong impulse to proceed to immediate violence, and broke
out into bitter raillery.
 
"Well, heres a pious dog, at last, let down among us sinners!a saint,
a gentleman, and no less, to talk to us sinners about our sins! Powerful
holy critter, he must be! Here, you rascal, you make believe to be so
pious,didnt you never hear, out of yer Bible, Servants, obey yer
masters? Ant I yer master? Didnt I pay down twelve hundred dollars,
cash, for all there is inside yer old cussed black shell? Ant yer mine,
now, body and soul?" he said, giving Tom a violent kick with his heavy
boot "tell me!"
 
In the very depth of physical suffering, bowed by brutal oppression,
this question shot a gleam of joy and triumph through Toms soul. He
suddenly stretched himself up, and, looking earnestly to heaven, while
the tears and blood that flowed down his face mingled, he exclaimed,
 
"No! no! no! my soul ant yours, Masr! You havent bought it,ye
cant buy it! Its been bought and paid for, by one that is able to keep
itno matter, no matter, you cant harm me!"
 
"I cant!" said Legree, with a sneer "well see,well see! Here,
Sambo, Quimbo, give this dog such a breakin in as he wont get over,
this month!"
 
The two gigantic negroes that now laid hold of Tom, with fiendish
exultation in their faces, might have formed no unapt personification of
powers of darkness. The poor woman screamed with apprehension, and all
rose, as by a general impulse, while they dragged him unresisting from
the place.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXXIV
 
The Quadroons Story
 
 
And behold the tears of such as are oppressed and on the side of
their oppressors there was power. Wherefore I praised the dead that are
already dead more than the living that are yet alive.ECCL. 41.
 
It was late at night, and Tom lay groaning and bleeding alone, in an old
forsaken room of the ginhouse, among pieces of broken machinery, piles
of damaged cotton, and other rubbish which had there accumulated.
 
The night was damp and close, and the thick air swarmed with myriads of
mosquitos, which increased the restless torture of his wounds whilst
a burning thirsta torture beyond all othersfilled up the uttermost
measure of physical anguish.
 
"O, good Lord! _Do_ look down,give me the victory!give me the
victory over all!" prayed poor Tom, in his anguish.
 
A footstep entered the room, behind him, and the light of a lantern
flashed on his eyes.
 
"Whos there? O, for the Lords massy, please give me some water!"
 
The woman Cassyfor it was she,set down her lantern, and, pouring
water from a bottle, raised his head, and gave him drink. Another and
another cup were drained, with feverish eagerness.
 
"Drink all ye want," she said "I knew how it would be. It isnt the
first time Ive been out in the night, carrying water to such as you."
 
"Thank you, Missis," said Tom, when he had done drinking.
 
"Dont call me Missis! Im a miserable slave, like yourself,a lower
one than you can ever be!" said she, bitterly "but now," said she,
going to the door, and dragging in a small pallaise, over which she had
spread linen cloths wet with cold water, "try, my poor fellow, to roll
yourself on to this."
 
Stiff with wounds and bruises, Tom was a long time in accomplishing this
movement but, when done, he felt a sensible relief from the cooling
application to his wounds.
 
The woman, whom long practice with the victims of brutality had made
familiar with many healing arts, went on to make many applications to
Toms wounds, by means of which he was soon somewhat relieved.
 
"Now," said the woman, when she had raised his head on a roll of damaged
cotton, which served for a pillow, "theres the best I can do for you."
 
Tom thanked her and the woman, sitting down on the floor, drew up her
knees, and embracing them with her arms, looked fixedly before her, with
a bitter and painful expression of countenance. Her bonnet fell back,
and long wavy streams of black hair fell around her singular and
melancholyface.
 
"Its no use, my poor fellow!" she broke out, at last, "its of no use,
this youve been trying to do. You were a brave fellow,you had the
right on your side but its all in vain, and out of the question, for
you to struggle. You are in the devils handshe is the strongest, and
you must give up!"
 
Give up! and, had not human weakness and physical agony whispered
that, before? Tom started for the bitter woman, with her wild eyes and
melancholy voice, seemed to him an embodiment of the temptation with
which he had been wrestling.
 
"O Lord! O Lord!" he groaned, "how can I give up?"
 
"Theres no use calling on the Lord,he never hears," said the woman,
steadily "there isnt any God, I believe or, if there is, hes taken
sides against us. All goes against us, heaven and earth. Everything is
pushing us into hell. Why shouldnt we go?"
 
Tom closed his eyes, and shuddered at the dark, atheistic words.
 
"You see," said the woman, "_you_ dont know anything about itI do.
Ive been on this place five years, body and soul, under this mans
foot and I hate him as I do the devil! Here you are, on a lone
plantation, ten miles from any other, in the swamps not a white person
here, who could testify, if you were burned alive,if you were scalded,
cut into inchpieces, set up for the dogs to tear, or hung up and
whipped to death. Theres no law here, of God or man, that can do you,
or any one of us, the least good and, this man! theres no earthly
thing that hes too good to do. I could make any ones hair rise, and
their teeth chatter, if I should only tell what Ive seen and been
knowing to, here,and its no use resisting! Did I _want_ to live with
him? Wasnt I a woman delicately bred and he,God in heaven! what
was he, and is he? And yet, Ive lived with him, these five years, and
cursed every moment of my life,night and day! And now, hes got a
new one,a young thing, only fifteen, and she brought up, she says,
piously. Her good mistress taught her to read the Bible and shes
brought her Bible hereto hell with her!"and the woman laughed a
wild and doleful laugh, that rung, with a strange, supernatural sound,
through the old ruined shed.
 
Tom folded his hands all was darkness and horror.
 
"O Jesus! Lord Jesus! have you quite forgot us poor critturs?" burst
forth, at last"help, Lord, I perish!"
 
The woman sternly continued
 
"And what are these miserable low dogs you work with, that you should
suffer on their account? Every one of them would turn against you, the
first time they got a chance. They are all of em as low and cruel to
each other as they can be theres no use in your suffering to keep from
hurting them."
 
"Poor critturs!" said Tom,"what made em cruel?and, if I give out,
I shall get used to t, and grow, little by little, just like em! No,
no, Missis! Ive lost everything,wife, and children, and home, and a
kind Masr,and he would have set me free, if hed only lived a week
longer Ive lost everything in _this_ world, and its clean gone,
forever,and now I _cant_ lose Heaven, too no, I cant get to be
wicked, besides all!"
 
"But it cant be that the Lord will lay sin to our account," said the
woman "he wont charge it to us, when were forced to it hell charge
it to them that drove us to it."
 
"Yes," said Tom "but that wont keep us from growing wicked. If I get
to be as hardhearted as that ar Sambo, and as wicked, it wont make
much odds to me how I come so its the bein so,that ars what Im a
dreadin."
 
The woman fixed a wild and startled look on Tom, as if a new thought had
struck her and then, heavily groaning, said,
 
"O God a mercy! you speak the truth! OOO!"and, with groans, she
fell on the floor, like one crushed and writhing under the extremity of
mental anguish.
 
There was a silence, a while, in which the breathing of both parties
could be heard, when Tom faintly said, "O, please, Missis!"
 
The woman suddenly rose up, with her face composed to its usual stern,
melancholy expression.
 
"Please, Missis, I saw em throw my coat in that ar corner, and in my
coatpocket is my Bibleif Missis would please get it for me."
 
Cassy went and got it. Tom opened, at once, to a heavily marked passage,
much worn, of the last scenes in the life of Him by whose stripes we are
healed.
 
"If Missis would only be so good as read that ar,its better than
water."
 
Cassy took the book, with a dry, proud air, and looked over the passage.
She then read aloud, in a soft voice, and with a beauty of intonation
that was peculiar, that touching account of anguish and of glory. Often,
as she read, her voice faltered, and sometimes failed her altogether,
when she would stop, with an air of frigid composure, till she had
mastered herself. When she came to the touching words, "Father forgive
them, for they know not what they do," she threw down the book, and,
burying her face in the heavy masses of her hair, she sobbed aloud, with
a convulsive violence.
 
Tom was weeping, also, and occasionally uttering a smothered
ejaculation.
 
"If we only could keep up to that ar!" said Tom"it seemed to come so
natural to him, and we have to fight so hard for t! O Lord, help us! O
blessed Lord Jesus, do help us!"
 
"Missis," said Tom, after a while, "I can see that, some how, youre
quite bove me in everything but theres one thing Missis might learn
even from poor Tom. Ye said the Lord took sides against us, because he
lets us be bused and knocked round but ye see what come on his own
Son,the blessed Lord of Glory,want he allays poor? and have we,
any on us, yet come so low as he come? The Lord hant forgot us,Im
sartin o that ar. If we suffer with him, we shall also reign,
Scripture says but, if we deny Him, he also will deny us. Didnt they
all suffer?the Lord and all his? It tells how they was stoned and
sawn asunder, and wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, and was
destitute, afflicted, tormented. Sufferin ant no reason to make us
think the Lords turned agin us but jest the contrary, if only we hold
on to him, and doesnt give up to sin."
 
"But why does he put us where we cant help but sin?" said the woman.
 
"I think we _can_ help it," said Tom.
 
"Youll see," said Cassy "whatll you do? Tomorrow theyll be at you
again. I know em Ive seen all their doings I cant bear to think of
all theyll bring you toand theyll make you give out, at last!"
 
"Lord Jesus!" said Tom, "you _will_ take care of my soul? O Lord,
do!dont let me give out!"
 
"O dear!" said Cassy "Ive heard all this crying and praying before
and yet, theyve been broken down, and brought under. Theres Emmeline,
shes trying to hold on, and youre trying,but what use? You must give
up, or be killed by inches."
 
"Well, then, I _will_ die!" said Tom. "Spin it out as long as they can,
they cant help my dying, some time!and, after that, they cant do
no more. Im clar, Im set! I _know_ the Lordll help me, and bring me
through."
 
The woman did not answer she sat with her black eyes intently fixed on
the floor.
 
"May be its the way," she murmured to herself "but those that _have_
given up, theres no hope for them!none! We live in filth, and grow
loathsome, till we loathe ourselves! And we long to die, and we
dont dare to kill ourselves!No hope! no hope! no hope?this girl
now,just as old as I was!
 
"You see me now," she said, speaking to Tom very rapidly "see what I
am! Well, I was brought up in luxury the first I remember is, playing
about, when I was a child, in splendid parlors,when I was kept dressed
up like a doll, and company and visitors used to praise me. There was
a garden opening from the saloon windows and there I used to play
hideandgoseek, under the orangetrees, with my brothers and sisters.
I went to a convent, and there I learned music, French and embroidery,
and what not and when I was fourteen, I came out to my fathers
funeral. He died very suddenly, and when the property came to be
settled, they found that there was scarcely enough to cover the debts
and when the creditors took an inventory of the property, I was set down
in it. My mother was a slave woman, and my father had always meant to
set me free but he had not done it, and so I was set down in the list.
Id always known who I was, but never thought much about it. Nobody ever
expects that a strong, healthy man is going to die. My father was a well
man only four hours before he diedit was one of the first cholera
cases in New Orleans. The day after the funeral, my fathers wife took
her children, and went up to her fathers plantation. I thought they
treated me strangely, but didnt know. There was a young lawyer who they
left to settle the business and he came every day, and was about the
house, and spoke very politely to me. He brought with him, one day, a
young man, whom I thought the handsomest I had ever seen. I shall never
forget that evening. I walked with him in the garden. I was lonesome and
full of sorrow, and he was so kind and gentle to me and he told me that
he had seen me before I went to the convent, and that he had loved me
a great while, and that he would be my friend and protectorin short,
though he didnt tell me, he had paid two thousand dollars for me, and I
was his property,I became his willingly, for I loved him. Loved!"
said the woman, stopping. "O, how I _did_ love that man! How I love him
now,and always shall, while I breathe! He was so beautiful, so high,
so noble! He put me into a beautiful house, with servants, horses, and
carriages, and furniture, and dresses. Everything that money could buy,
he gave me but I didnt set any value on all that,I only cared for
him. I loved him better than my God and my own soul, and, if I tried, I
couldnt do any other way from what he wanted me to.
 
"I wanted only one thingI did want him to _marry_ me. I thought, if he
loved me as he said he did, and if I was what he seemed to think I was,
he would be willing to marry me and set me free. But he convinced
me that it would be impossible and he told me that, if we were only
faithful to each other, it was marriage before God. If that is true,
wasnt I that mans wife? Wasnt I faithful? For seven years, didnt I
study every look and motion, and only live and breathe to please him? He
had the yellow fever, and for twenty days and nights I watched with him.
I alone,and gave him all his medicine, and did everything for him and
then he called me his good angel, and said Id saved his life. We had
two beautiful children. The first was a boy, and we called him Henry.
He was the image of his father,he had such beautiful eyes, such a
forehead, and his hair hung all in curls around it and he had all his
fathers spirit, and his talent, too. Little Elise, he said, looked like
me. He used to tell me that I was the most beautiful woman in Louisiana,
he was so proud of me and the children. He used to love to have me dress
them up, and take them and me about in an open carriage, and hear
the remarks that people would make on us and he used to fill my ears
constantly with the fine things that were said in praise of me and the
children. O, those were happy days! I thought I was as happy as any one
could be but then there came evil times. He had a cousin come to New
Orleans, who was his particular friend,he thought all the world of
himbut, from the first time I saw him, I couldnt tell why, I dreaded
him for I felt sure he was going to bring misery on us. He got Henry to
going out with him, and often he would not come home nights till two
or three oclock. I did not dare say a word for Henry was so high
spirited, I was afraid to. He got him to the gaminghouses and he
was one of the sort that, when he once got a going there, there was no
holding back. And then he introduced him to another lady, and I saw soon
that his heart was gone from me. He never told me, but I saw it,I
knew it, day after day,I felt my heart breaking, but I could not say
a word! At this, the wretch offered to buy me and the children of Henry,
to clear off his gambling debts, which stood in the way of his marrying
as he wishedand _he sold us_. He told me, one day, that he had
business in the country, and should be gone two or three weeks. He spoke
kinder than usual, and said he should come back but it didnt deceive
me. I knew that the time had come I was just like one turned into
stone I couldnt speak, nor shed a tear. He kissed me and kissed the
children, a good many times, and went out. I saw him get on his horse,
and I watched him till he was quite out of sight and then I fell down,
and fainted.
 
"Then _he_ came, the cursed wretch! he came to take possession. He told
me that he had bought me and my children and showed me the papers. I
cursed him before God, and told him Id die sooner than live with him."
 
"Just as you please, said he but, if you dont behave reasonably,
Ill sell both the children, where you shall never see them again. He
told me that he always had meant to have me, from the first time he saw
me and that he had drawn Henry on, and got him in debt, on purpose to
make him willing to sell me. That he got him in love with another woman
and that I might know, after all that, that he should not give up for a
few airs and tears, and things of that sort.
 
"I gave up, for my hands were tied. He had my childrenwhenever I
resisted his will anywhere, he would talk about selling them, and he
made me as submissive as he desired. O, what a life it was! to live with
my heart breaking, every day,to keep on, on, on, loving, when it was
only misery and to be bound, body and soul, to one I hated. I used to
love to read to Henry, to play to him, to waltz with him, and sing to
him but everything I did for this one was a perfect drag,yet I was
afraid to refuse anything. He was very imperious, and harsh to the
children. Elise was a timid little thing but Henry was bold and
highspirited, like his father, and he had never been brought under, in
the least, by any one. He was always finding fault, and quarrelling with
him and I used to live in daily fear and dread. I tried to make the
child respectfulI tried to keep them apart, for I held on to those
children like death but it did no good. _He sold both those children_.
He took me to ride, one day, and when I came home, they were nowhere to
be found! He told me he had sold them he showed me the money, the price
of their blood. Then it seemed as if all good forsook me. I raved and
cursed,cursed God and man and, for a while, I believe, he really was
afraid of me. But he didnt give up so. He told me that my children were
sold, but whether I ever saw their faces again, depended on him and
that, if I wasnt quiet, they should smart for it. Well, you can do
anything with a woman, when youve got her children. He made me submit
he made me be peaceable he flattered me with hopes that, perhaps, he
would buy them back and so things went on, a week or two. One day, I
was out walking, and passed by the calaboose I saw a crowd about the
gate, and heard a childs voice,and suddenly my Henry broke away from
two or three men who were holding him, and ran, screaming, and caught
my dress. They came up to him, swearing dreadfully and one man, whose
face I shall never forget, told him that he wouldnt get away so that
he was going with him into the calaboose, and hed get a lesson there
hed never forget. I tried to beg and plead,they only laughed the
poor boy screamed and looked into my face, and held on to me, until, in
tearing him off, they tore the skirt of my dress half away and they
carried him in, screaming Mother! mother! mother! There was one man
stood there seemed to pity me. I offered him all the money I had, if
hed only interfere. He shook his head, and said that the boy had been
impudent and disobedient, ever since he bought him that he was going
to break him in, once for all. I turned and ran and every step of the
way, I thought that I heard him scream. I got into the house ran, all
out of breath, to the parlor, where I found Butler. I told him, and
begged him to go and interfere. He only laughed, and told me the boy
had got his deserts. Hed got to be broken in,the sooner the better
what did I expect? he asked.
 
"It seemed to me something in my head snapped, at that moment. I felt
dizzy and furious. I remember seeing a great sharp bowieknife on the
table I remember something about catching it, and flying upon him and
then all grew dark, and I didnt know any more,not for days and days.
 
"When I came to myself, I was in a nice room,but not mine. An old
black woman tended me and a doctor came to see me, and there was a
great deal of care taken of me. After a while, I found that he had gone
away, and left me at this house to be sold and thats why they took
such pains with me.
 
"I didnt mean to get well, and hoped I shouldnt but, in spite of me
the fever went off and I grew healthy, and finally got up. Then, they
made me dress up, every day and gentlemen used to come in and stand
and smoke their cigars, and look at me, and ask questions, and debate
my price. I was so gloomy and silent, that none of them wanted me. They
threatened to whip me, if I wasnt gayer, and didnt take some pains
to make myself agreeable. At length, one day, came a gentleman named
Stuart. He seemed to have some feeling for me he saw that something
dreadful was on my heart, and he came to see me alone, a great many
times, and finally persuaded me to tell him. He bought me, at last, and
promised to do all he could to find and buy back my children. He went
to the hotel where my Henry was they told him he had been sold to a
planter up on Pearl River that was the last that I ever heard. Then he
found where my daughter was an old woman was keeping her. He offered an
immense sum for her, but they would not sell her. Butler found out that
it was for me he wanted her and he sent me word that I should never
have her. Captain Stuart was very kind to me he had a splendid
plantation, and took me to it. In the course of a year, I had a son
born. O, that child!how I loved it! How just like my poor Henry the
little thing looked! But I had made up my mind,yes, I had. I would
never again let a child live to grow up! I took the little fellow in my
arms, when he was two weeks old, and kissed him, and cried over him and
then I gave him laudanum, and held him close to my bosom, while he slept
to death. How I mourned and cried over it! and who ever dreamed that it
was anything but a mistake, that had made me give it the laudanum? but
its one of the few things that Im glad of, now. I am not sorry, to
this day he, at least, is out of pain. What better than death could
I give him, poor child! After a while, the cholera came, and Captain
Stuart died everybody died that wanted to live,and I,I, though I
went down to deaths door,_I lived!_ Then I was sold, and passed from
hand to hand, till I grew faded and wrinkled, and I had a fever and
then this wretch bought me, and brought me here,and here I am!"
 
The woman stopped. She had hurried on through her story, with a wild,
passionate utterance sometimes seeming to address it to Tom, and
sometimes speaking as in a soliloquy. So vehement and overpowering was
the force with which she spoke, that, for a season, Tom was beguiled
even from the pain of his wounds, and, raising himself on one elbow,
watched her as she paced restlessly up and down, her long black hair
swaying heavily about her, as she moved.
 
"You tell me," she said, after a pause, "that there is a God,a God
that looks down and sees all these things. May be its so. The sisters
in the convent used to tell me of a day of judgment, when everything is
coming to lightwont there be vengeance, then!
 
"They think its nothing, what we suffer,nothing, what our children
suffer! Its all a small matter yet Ive walked the streets when it
seemed as if I had misery enough in my one heart to sink the city. Ive
wished the houses would fall on me, or the stones sink under me. Yes!
and, in the judgment day, I will stand up before God, a witness against
those that have ruined me and my children, body and soul!
 
"When I was a girl, I thought I was religious I used to love God and
prayer. Now, Im a lost soul, pursued by devils that torment me day
and night they keep pushing me on and onand Ill do it, too, some of
these days!" she said, clenching her hand, while an insane light glanced
in her heavy black eyes. "Ill send him where he belongs,a short way,
too,one of these nights, if they burn me alive for it!" A wild, long
laugh rang through the deserted room, and ended in a hysteric sob she
threw herself on the floor, in convulsive sobbing and struggles.
 
In a few moments, the frenzy fit seemed to pass off she rose slowly,
and seemed to collect herself.
 
"Can I do anything more for you, my poor fellow?" she said, approaching
where Tom lay "shall I give you some more water?"
 
There was a graceful and compassionate sweetness in her voice and
manner, as she said this, that formed a strange contrast with the former
wildness.
 
Tom drank the water, and looked earnestly and pitifully into her face.
 
"O, Missis, I wish youd go to him that can give you living waters!"
 
"Go to him! Where is he? Who is he?" said Cassy.
 
"Him that you read of to me,the Lord."
 
"I used to see the picture of him, over the altar, when I was a girl,"
said Cassy, her dark eyes fixing themselves in an expression of mournful
reverie "but, _he isnt here!_ theres nothing here, but sin and long,
long, long despair! O!" She laid her land on her breast and drew in her
breath, as if to lift a heavy weight.
 
Tom looked as if he would speak again but she cut him short, with a
decided gesture.
 
"Dont talk, my poor fellow. Try to sleep, if you can." And, placing
water in his reach, and making whatever little arrangements for his
comforts she could, Cassy left the shed.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXXV
 
The Tokens
 
     "And slight, withal, may be the things that bring
     Back on the heart the weight which it would fling
     Aside forever it may be a sound,
     A flower, the wind, the ocean, which shall wound,
     Striking the electric chain wherewith were darkly bound."
     CHILDE HAROLDS PILGRIMAGE, CAN. 4.
 
The sittingroom of Legrees establishment was a large, long room,
with a wide, ample fireplace. It had once been hung with a showy and
expensive paper, which now hung mouldering, torn and discolored, from
the damp walls. The place had that peculiar sickening, unwholesome
smell, compounded of mingled damp, dirt and decay, which one often
notices in close old houses. The wallpaper was defaced, in spots, by
slops of beer and wine or garnished with chalk memorandums, and long
sums footed up, as if somebody had been practising arithmetic there. In
the fireplace stood a brazier full of burning charcoal for, though the
weather was not cold, the evenings always seemed damp and chilly in that
great room and Legree, moreover, wanted a place to light his cigars,
and heat his water for punch. The ruddy glare of the charcoal displayed
the confused and unpromising aspect of the room,saddles, bridles,
several sorts of harness, ridingwhips, overcoats, and various articles
of clothing, scattered up and down the room in confused variety and the
dogs, of whom we have before spoken, had encamped themselves among them,
to suit their own taste and convenience.
 
Legree was just mixing himself a tumbler of punch, pouring his hot water
from a cracked and brokennosed pitcher, grumbling, as he did so,
 
"Plague on that Sambo, to kick up this yer row between me and the new
hands! The fellow wont be fit to work for a week, now,right in the
press of the season!"
 
"Yes, just like you," said a voice, behind his chair. It was the woman
Cassy, who had stolen upon his soliloquy.
 
"Hah! you shedevil! youve come back, have you?"
 
"Yes, I have," she said, coolly "come to have my own way, too!"
 
"You lie, you jade! Ill be up to my word. Either behave yourself, or
stay down to the quarters, and fare and work with the rest."
 
"Id rather, ten thousand times," said the woman, "live in the dirtiest
hole at the quarters, than be under your hoof!"
 
"But you _are_ under my hoof, for all that," said he, turning upon her,
with a savage grin "thats one comfort. So, sit down here on my knee,
my dear, and hear to reason," said he, laying hold on her wrist.
 
"Simon Legree, take care!" said the woman, with a sharp flash of her
eye, a glance so wild and insane in its light as to be almost appalling.
"Youre afraid of me, Simon," she said, deliberately "and youve reason
to be! But be careful, for Ive got the devil in me!"
 
The last words she whispered in a hissing tone, close to his ear.
 
"Get out! I believe, to my soul, you have!" said Legree, pushing her
from him, and looking uncomfortably at her. "After all, Cassy," he said,
"why cant you be friends with me, as you used to?"
 
"Used to!" said she, bitterly. She stopped short,a word of choking
feelings, rising in her heart, kept her silent.
 
Cassy had always kept over Legree the kind of influence that a strong,
impassioned woman can ever keep over the most brutal man but, of late,
she had grown more and more irritable and restless, under the hideous
yoke of her servitude, and her irritability, at times, broke out into
raving insanity and this liability made her a sort of object of dread
to Legree, who had that superstitious horror of insane persons which is
common to coarse and uninstructed minds. When Legree brought Emmeline to
the house, all the smouldering embers of womanly feeling flashed up in
the worn heart of Cassy, and she took part with the girl and a fierce
quarrel ensued between her and Legree. Legree, in a fury, swore she
should be put to field service, if she would not be peaceable. Cassy,
with proud scorn, declared she _would_ go to the field. And she worked
there one day, as we have described, to show how perfectly she scorned
the threat.
 
Legree was secretly uneasy, all day for Cassy had an influence over him
from which he could not free himself. When she presented her basket at
the scales, he had hoped for some concession, and addressed her in a
sort of half conciliatory, half scornful tone and she had answered with
the bitterest contempt.
 
The outrageous treatment of poor Tom had roused her still more and she
had followed Legree to the house, with no particular intention, but to
upbraid him for his brutality.
 
"I wish, Cassy," said Legree, "youd behave yourself decently."
 
"_You_ talk about behaving decently! And what have you been doing?you,
who havent even sense enough to keep from spoiling one of your best
hands, right in the most pressing season, just for your devilish
temper!"
 
"I was a fool, its a fact, to let any such brangle come up," said
Legree "but, when the boy set up his will, he had to be broke in."
 
"I reckon you wont break _him_ in!"
 
"Wont I?" said Legree, rising, passionately. "Id like to know if I
wont? Hell be the first nigger that ever came it round me! Ill break
every bone in his body, but he _shall_ give up!"
 
Just then the door opened, and Sambo entered. He came forward, bowing,
and holding out something in a paper.
 
"Whats that, you dog?" said Legree.
 
"Its a witch thing, Masr!"
 
"A what?"
 
"Something that niggers gets from witches. Keeps em from feelin when
they s flogged. He had it tied round his neck, with a black string."
 
Legree, like most godless and cruel men, was superstitious. He took the
paper, and opened it uneasily.
 
There dropped out of it a silver dollar, and a long, shining curl
of fair hair,hair which, like a living thing, twined itself round
Legrees fingers.
 
"Damnation!" he screamed, in sudden passion, stamping on the floor, and
pulling furiously at the hair, as if it burned him. "Where did this come
from? Take it off!burn it up!burn it up!" he screamed, tearing it
off, and throwing it into the charcoal. "What did you bring it to me
for?"
 
Sambo stood, with his heavy mouth wide open, and aghast with wonder and
Cassy, who was preparing to leave the apartment, stopped, and looked at
him in perfect amazement.
 
"Dont you bring me any more of your devilish things!" said he, shaking
his fist at Sambo, who retreated hastily towards the door and, picking
up the silver dollar, he sent it smashing through the windowpane, out
into the darkness.
 
Sambo was glad to make his escape. When he was gone, Legree seemed a
little ashamed of his fit of alarm. He sat doggedly down in his chair,
and began sullenly sipping his tumbler of punch.
 
Cassy prepared herself for going out, unobserved by him and slipped
away to minister to poor Tom, as we have already related.
 
And what was the matter with Legree? and what was there in a simple
curl of fair hair to appall that brutal man, familiar with every form
of cruelty? To answer this, we must carry the reader backward in his
history. Hard and reprobate as the godless man seemed now, there had
been a time when he had been rocked on the bosom of a mother,cradled
with prayers and pious hymns,his now seared brow bedewed with the
waters of holy baptism. In early childhood, a fairhaired woman had led
him, at the sound of Sabbath bell, to worship and to pray. Far in New
England that mother had trained her only son, with long, unwearied love,
and patient prayers. Born of a hardtempered sire, on whom that gentle
woman had wasted a world of unvalued love, Legree had followed in the
steps of his father. Boisterous, unruly, and tyrannical, he despised all
her counsel, and would none of her reproof and, at an early age, broke
from her, to seek his fortunes at sea. He never came home but once,
after and then, his mother, with the yearning of a heart that must love
something, and has nothing else to love, clung to him, and sought, with
passionate prayers and entreaties, to win him from a life of sin, to his
souls eternal good.
 
That was Legrees day of grace then good angels called him then he
was almost persuaded, and mercy held him by the hand. His heart inly
relented,there was a conflict,but sin got the victory, and he
set all the force of his rough nature against the conviction of his
conscience. He drank and swore,was wilder and more brutal than ever.
And, one night, when his mother, in the last agony of her despair, knelt
at his feet, he spurned her from him,threw her senseless on the floor,
and, with brutal curses, fled to his ship. The next Legree heard of
his mother was, when, one night, as he was carousing among drunken
companions, a letter was put into his hand. He opened it, and a lock
of long, curling hair fell from it, and twined about his fingers. The
letter told him his mother was dead, and that, dying, she blest and
forgave him.
 
There is a dread, unhallowed necromancy of evil, that turns things
sweetest and holiest to phantoms of horror and affright. That pale,
loving mother,her dying prayers, her forgiving love,wrought in that
demoniac heart of sin only as a damning sentence, bringing with it a
fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation. Legree burned the
hair, and burned the letter and when he saw them hissing and crackling
in the flame, inly shuddered as he thought of everlasting fires. He
tried to drink, and revel, and swear away the memory but often, in
the deep night, whose solemn stillness arraigns the bad soul in forced
communion with herself, he had seen that pale mother rising by his
bedside, and felt the soft twining of that hair around his fingers, till
the cold sweat would roll down his face, and he would spring from his
bed in horror. Ye who have wondered to hear, in the same evangel, that
God is love, and that God is a consuming fire, see ye not how, to the
soul resolved in evil, perfect love is the most fearful torture, the
seal and sentence of the direst despair?
 
"Blast it!" said Legree to himself, as he sipped his liquor "where did
he get that? If it didnt look just likewhoo! I thought Id forgot
that. Curse me, if I think theres any such thing as forgetting
anything, any how,hang it! Im lonesome! I mean to call Em. She hates
methe monkey! I dont care,Ill _make_ her come!"
 
Legree stepped out into a large entry, which went up stairs, by what had
formerly been a superb winding staircase but the passageway was dirty
and dreary, encumbered with boxes and unsightly litter. The stairs,
uncarpeted, seemed winding up, in the gloom, to nobody knew where! The
pale moonlight streamed through a shattered fanlight over the door the
air was unwholesome and chilly, like that of a vault.
 
Legree stopped at the foot of the stairs, and heard a voice singing. It
seemed strange and ghostlike in that dreary old house, perhaps because
of the already tremulous state of his nerves. Hark! what is it?
 
A wild, pathetic voice, chants a hymn common among the slaves
 
     "O therell be mourning, mourning, mourning,
     O therell be mourning, at the judgmentseat of Christ!"
 
"Blast the girl!" said Legree. "Ill choke her.Em! Em!" he called,
harshly but only a mocking echo from the walls answered him. The sweet
voice still sung on
 
     "Parents and children there shall part!
     Parents and children there shall part!
     Shall part to meet no more!"
 
And clear and loud swelled through the empty halls the refrain,
 
     "O therell be mourning, mourning, mourning,
     O therell be mourning, at the judgmentseat of Christ!"
 
Legree stopped. He would have been ashamed to tell of it, but large
drops of sweat stood on his forehead, his heart beat heavy and thick
with fear he even thought he saw something white rising and glimmering
in the gloom before him, and shuddered to think what if the form of his
dead mother should suddenly appear to him.
 
"I know one thing," he said to himself, as he stumbled back in the
sittingroom, and sat down "Ill let that fellow alone, after this!
What did I want of his cussed paper? I blieve I am bewitched, sure
enough! Ive been shivering and sweating, ever since! Where did he get
that hair? It couldnt have been _that!_ I burnt _that_ up, I know I
did! It would be a joke, if hair could rise from the dead!"
 
Ah, Legree! that golden tress _was_ charmed each hair had in it a spell
of terror and remorse for thee, and was used by a mightier power to bind
thy cruel hands from inflicting uttermost evil on the helpless!
 
"I say," said Legree, stamping and whistling to the dogs, "wake up, some
of you, and keep me company!" but the dogs only opened one eye at him,
sleepily, and closed it again.
 
"Ill have Sambo and Quimbo up here, to sing and dance one of their hell
dances, and keep off these horrid notions," said Legree and, putting
on his hat, he went on to the verandah, and blew a horn, with which he
commonly summoned his two sable drivers.
 
Legree was often wont, when in a gracious humor, to get these two
worthies into his sittingroom, and, after warming them up with whiskey,
amuse himself by setting them to singing, dancing or fighting, as the
humor took him.
 
It was between one and two oclock at night, as Cassy was returning
from her ministrations to poor Tom, that she heard the sound of wild
shrieking, whooping, halloing, and singing, from the sittingroom,
mingled with the barking of dogs, and other symptoms of general uproar.
 
She came up on the verandah steps, and looked in. Legree and both the
drivers, in a state of furious intoxication, were singing, whooping,
upsetting chairs, and making all manner of ludicrous and horrid grimaces
at each other.
 
She rested her small, slender hand on the windowblind, and looked
fixedly at themthere was a world of anguish, scorn, and fierce
bitterness, in her black eyes, as she did so. "Would it be a sin to rid
the world of such a wretch?" she said to herself.
 
She turned hurriedly away, and, passing round to a back door, glided up
stairs, and tapped at Emmelines door.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXXVI
 
Emmeline and Cassy
 
 
Cassy entered the room, and found Emmeline sitting, pale with fear,
in the furthest corner of it. As she came in, the girl started up
nervously but, on seeing who it was, rushed forward, and catching her
arm, said, "O Cassy, is it you? Im so glad youve come! I was afraid
it was. O, you dont know what a horrid noise there has been, down
stairs, all this evening!"
 
"I ought to know," said Cassy, dryly. "Ive heard it often enough."
 
"O Cassy! do tell me,couldnt we get away from this place? I dont
care where,into the swamp among the snakes,anywhere! _Couldnt_ we
get _somewhere_ away from here?"
 
"Nowhere, but into our graves," said Cassy.
 
"Did you ever try?"
 
"Ive seen enough of trying and what comes of it," said Cassy.
 
"Id be willing to live in the swamps, and gnaw the bark from trees.
I ant afraid of snakes! Id rather have one near me than him," said
Emmeline, eagerly.
 
"There have been a good many here of your opinion," said Cassy "but you
couldnt stay in the swamps,youd be tracked by the dogs, and brought
back, and thenthen"
 
"What would he do?" said the girl, looking, with breathless interest,
into her face.
 
"What _wouldnt_ he do, youd better ask," said Cassy. "Hes learned
his trade well, among the pirates in the West Indies. You wouldnt sleep
much, if I should tell you things Ive seen,things that he tells of,
sometimes, for good jokes. Ive heard screams here that I havent been
able to get out of my head for weeks and weeks. Theres a place way out
down by the quarters, where you can see a black, blasted tree, and the
ground all covered with black ashes. Ask anyone what was done there, and
see if they will dare to tell you."
 
"O! what do you mean?"
 
"I wont tell you. I hate to think of it. And I tell you, the Lord only
knows what we may see tomorrow, if that poor fellow holds out as hes
begun."
 
"Horrid!" said Emmeline, every drop of blood receding from her cheeks.
"O, Cassy, do tell me what I shall do!"
 
"What Ive done. Do the best you can,do what you must,and make it up
in hating and cursing."
 
"He wanted to make me drink some of his hateful brandy," said Emmeline
"and I hate it so"
 
"Youd better drink," said Cassy. "I hated it, too and now I cant live
without it. One must have somethingthings dont look so dreadful,
when you take that."
 
"Mother used to tell me never to touch any such thing," said Emmeline.
 
"_Mother_ told you!" said Cassy, with a thrilling and bitter emphasis
on the word mother. "What use is it for mothers to say anything? You
are all to be bought and paid for, and your souls belong to whoever gets
you. Thats the way it goes. I say, _drink_ brandy drink all you can,
and itll make things come easier."
 
"O, Cassy! do pity me!"
 
"Pity you!dont I? Havent I a daughter,Lord knows where she is,
and whose she is, now,going the way her mother went, before her, I
suppose, and that her children must go, after her! Theres no end to the
curseforever!"
 
"I wish Id never been born!" said Emmeline, wringing her hands.
 
"Thats an old wish with me," said Cassy. "Ive got used to wishing
that. Id die, if I dared to," she said, looking out into the darkness,
with that still, fixed despair which was the habitual expression of her
face when at rest.
 
"It would be wicked to kill ones self," said Emmeline.
 
"I dont know why,no wickeder than things we live and do, day after
day. But the sisters told me things, when I was in the convent, that
make me afraid to die. If it would only be the end of us, why, then"
 
Emmeline turned away, and hid her face in her hands.
 
While this conversation was passing in the chamber, Legree, overcome
with his carouse, had sunk to sleep in the room below. Legree was not an
habitual drunkard. His coarse, strong nature craved, and could endure,
a continual stimulation, that would have utterly wrecked and crazed a
finer one. But a deep, underlying spirit of cautiousness prevented his
often yielding to appetite in such measure as to lose control of himself.
 
This night, however, in his feverish efforts to banish from his mind
those fearful elements of woe and remorse which woke within him, he had
indulged more than common so that, when he had discharged his sable
attendants, he fell heavily on a settle in the room, and was sound
asleep.
 
O! how dares the bad soul to enter the shadowy world of sleep?that
land whose dim outlines lie so fearfully near to the mystic scene of
retribution! Legree dreamed. In his heavy and feverish sleep, a veiled
form stood beside him, and laid a cold, soft hand upon him. He thought
he knew who it was and shuddered, with creeping horror, though the
face was veiled. Then he thought he felt _that hair_ twining round his
fingers and then, that it slid smoothly round his neck, and tightened
and tightened, and he could not draw his breath and then he thought
voices _whispered_ to him,whispers that chilled him with horror. Then
it seemed to him he was on the edge of a frightful abyss, holding on
and struggling in mortal fear, while dark hands stretched up, and were
pulling him over and Cassy came behind him laughing, and pushed him.
And then rose up that solemn veiled figure, and drew aside the veil. It
was his mother and she turned away from him, and he fell down, down,
down, amid a confused noise of shrieks, and groans, and shouts of demon
laughter,and Legree awoke.
 
Calmly the rosy hue of dawn was stealing into the room. The morning star
stood, with its solemn, holy eye of light, looking down on the man
of sin, from out the brightening sky. O, with what freshness, what
solemnity and beauty, is each new day born as if to say to insensate
man, "Behold! thou hast one more chance! _Strive_ for immortal glory!"
There is no speech nor language where this voice is not heard but the
bold, bad man heard it not. He woke with an oath and a curse. What to
him was the gold and purple, the daily miracle of morning! What to him
the sanctity of the star which the Son of God has hallowed as his own
emblem? Brutelike, he saw without perceiving and, stumbling forward,
poured out a tumbler of brandy, and drank half of it.
 
"Ive had a hl of a night!" he said to Cassy, who just then entered
from an opposite door.
 
"Youll get plenty of the same sort, by and by," said she, dryly.
 
"What do you mean, you minx?"
 
"Youll find out, one of these days," returned Cassy, in the same tone.
"Now Simon, Ive one piece of advice to give you."
 
"The devil, you have!"
 
"My advice is," said Cassy, steadily, as she began adjusting some things
about the room, "that you let Tom alone."
 
"What business is t of yours?"
 
"What? To be sure, I dont know what it should be. If you want to pay
twelve hundred for a fellow, and use him right up in the press of the
season, just to serve your own spite, its no business of mine, Ive
done what I could for him."
 
"You have? What business have you meddling in my matters?"
 
"None, to be sure. Ive saved you some thousands of dollars, at
different times, by taking care of your hands,thats all the thanks
I get. If your crop comes shorter into market than any of theirs, you
wont lose your bet, I suppose? Tompkins wont lord it over you, I
suppose,and youll pay down your money like a lady, wont you? I think
I see you doing it!"
 
Legree, like many other planters, had but one form of ambition,to have
in the heaviest crop of the season,and he had several bets on this
very present season pending in the next town. Cassy, therefore, with
womans tact, touched the only string that could be made to vibrate.
 
"Well, Ill let him off at what hes got," said Legree "but he shall
beg my pardon, and promise better fashions."
 
"That he wont do," said Cassy.
 
"Wont,eh?"
 
"No, he wont," said Cassy.
 
"Id like to know _why_, Mistress," said Legree, in the extreme of
scorn.
 
"Because hes done right, and he knows it, and wont say hes done
wrong."
 
"Who a cuss cares what he knows? The nigger shall say what I please,
or"
 
"Or, youll lose your bet on the cotton crop, by keeping him out of the
field, just at this very press."
 
"But he _will_ give up,course, he will dont I know what niggers is?
Hell beg like a dog, this morning."
 
"He wont, Simon you dont know this kind. You may kill him by
inches,you wont get the first word of confession out of him."
 
"Well see,where is he?" said Legree, going out.
 
"In the wasteroom of the ginhouse," said Cassy.
 
Legree, though he talked so stoutly to Cassy, still sallied forth from
the house with a degree of misgiving which was not common with him. His
dreams of the past night, mingled with Cassys prudential suggestions,
considerably affected his mind. He resolved that nobody should be
witness of his encounter with Tom and determined, if he could not
subdue him by bullying, to defer his vengeance, to be wreaked in a more
convenient season.
 
The solemn light of dawnthe angelic glory of the morningstarhad
looked in through the rude window of the shed where Tom was lying and,
as if descending on that starbeam, came the solemn words, "I am the
root and offspring of David, and the bright and morning star." The
mysterious warnings and intimations of Cassy, so far from discouraging
his soul, in the end had roused it as with a heavenly call. He did not
know but that the day of his death was dawning in the sky and his heart
throbbed with solemn throes of joy and desire, as he thought that the
wondrous _all_, of which he had often pondered,the great white throne,
with its ever radiant rainbow the whiterobed multitude, with voices as
many waters the crowns, the palms, the harps,might all break upon
his vision before that sun should set again. And, therefore, without
shuddering or trembling, he heard the voice of his persecutor, as he
drew near.
 
"Well, my boy," said Legree, with a contemptuous kick, "how do you find
yourself? Didnt I tell yer I could larn yer a thing or two? How do yer
like iteh? How did yer whaling agree with yer, Tom? Ant quite so
crank as ye was last night. Ye couldnt treat a poor sinner, now, to a
bit of sermon, could ye,eh?"
 
Tom answered nothing.
 
"Get up, you beast!" said Legree, kicking him again.
 
This was a difficult matter for one so bruised and faint and, as Tom
made efforts to do so, Legree laughed brutally.
 
"What makes ye so spry, this morning, Tom? Cotched cold, may be, last
night."
 
Tom by this time had gained his feet, and was confronting his master
with a steady, unmoved front.
 
"The devil, you can!" said Legree, looking him over. "I believe you
havent got enough yet. Now, Tom, get right down on yer knees and beg my
pardon, for yer shines last night."
 
Tom did not move.
 
"Down, you dog!" said Legree, striking him with his ridingwhip.
 
"Masr Legree," said Tom, "I cant do it. I did only what I thought was
right. I shall do just so again, if ever the time comes. I never will do
a cruel thing, come what may."
 
"Yes, but ye dont know what may come, Master Tom. Ye think what youve
got is something. I tell you tant anything,nothing t all. How
would ye like to be tied to a tree, and have a slow fire lit up around
yewouldnt that be pleasant,eh, Tom?"
 
"Masr," said Tom, "I know ye can do dreadful things but,"he
stretched himself upward and clasped his hands,"but, after yeve
killed the body, there ant no more ye can do. And O, theres all
ETERNITY to come, after that!"
 
ETERNITY,the word thrilled through the black mans soul with light and
power, as he spoke it thrilled through the sinners soul, too, like the
bite of a scorpion. Legree gnashed on him with his teeth, but rage kept
him silent and Tom, like a man disenthralled, spoke, in a clear and
cheerful voice,
 
"Masr Legree, as ye bought me, Ill be a true and faithful servant to
ye. Ill give ye all the work of my hands, all my time, all my strength
but my soul I wont give up to mortal man. I will hold on to the Lord,
and put his commands before all,die or live you may be sure on t.
Masr Legree, I aint a grain afeard to die. Id as soon die as not. Ye
may whip me, starve me, burn me,itll only send me sooner where I want
to go."
 
"Ill make ye give out, though, fore Ive done!" said Legree, in a
rage.
 
"I shall have _help_," said Tom "youll never do it."
 
"Who the devils going to help you?" said Legree, scornfully.
 
"The Lord Almighty," said Tom.
 
"Dn you!" said Legree, as with one blow of his fist he felled Tom to
the earth.
 
A cold soft hand fell on Legrees at this moment. He turned,it was
Cassys but the cold soft touch recalled his dream of the night before,
and, flashing through the chambers of his brain, came all the fearful
images of the nightwatches, with a portion of the horror that
accompanied them.
 
"Will you be a fool?" said Cassy, in French. "Let him go! Let me alone
to get him fit to be in the field again. Isnt it just as I told you?"
 
They say the alligator, the rhinoceros, though enclosed in bulletproof
mail, have each a spot where they are vulnerable and fierce, reckless,
unbelieving reprobates, have commonly this point in superstitious dread.
 
Legree turned away, determined to let the point go for the time.
 
"Well, have it your own way," he said, doggedly, to Cassy.
 
"Hark, ye!" he said to Tom "I wont deal with ye now, because the
business is pressing, and I want all my hands but I _never_ forget.
Ill score it against ye, and sometime Ill have my pay out o yer old
black hide,mind ye!"
 
Legree turned, and went out.
 
"There you go," said Cassy, looking darkly after him "your reckonings
to come, yet!My poor fellow, how are you?"
 
"The Lord God hath sent his angel, and shut the lions mouth, for this
time," said Tom.
 
"For this time, to be sure," said Cassy "but now youve got his ill
will upon you, to follow you day in, day out, hanging like a dog on your
throat,sucking your blood, bleeding away your life, drop by drop. I
know the man."
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXXVII
 
Liberty
 
 
"No matter with what solemnities he may have been devoted upon the altar
of slavery, the moment he touches the sacred soil of Britain, the
altar and the God sink together in the dust, and he stands redeemed,
regenerated, and disenthralled, by the irresistible genius of universal
emancipation." CURRAN.
 
      John Philpot Curran 17501817, Irish orator and judge
     who worked for Catholic emancipation.
 
A while we must leave Tom in the hands of his persecutors, while we turn
to pursue the fortunes of George and his wife, whom we left in friendly
hands, in a farmhouse on the roadside.
 
Tom Loker we left groaning and touzling in a most immaculately clean
Quaker bed, under the motherly supervision of Aunt Dorcas, who found him
to the full as tractable a patient as a sick bison.
 
Imagine a tall, dignified, spiritual woman, whose clear muslin cap
shades waves of silvery hair, parted on a broad, clear forehead, which
overarches thoughtful gray eyes. A snowy handkerchief of lisse crape
is folded neatly across her bosom her glossy brown silk dress rustles
peacefully, as she glides up and down the chamber.
 
"The devil!" says Tom Loker, giving a great throw to the bedclothes.
 
"I must request thee, Thomas, not to use such language," says Aunt
Dorcas, as she quietly rearranged the bed.
 
"Well, I wont, granny, if I can help it," says Tom "but it is enough
to make a fellow swear,so cursedly hot!"
 
Dorcas removed a comforter from the bed, straightened the clothes
again, and tucked them in till Tom looked something like a chrysalis
remarking, as she did so,
 
"I wish, friend, thee would leave off cursing and swearing, and think
upon thy ways."
 
"What the devil," said Tom, "should I think of _them_ for? Last
thing ever _I_ want to think ofhang it all!" And Tom flounced over,
untucking and disarranging everything, in a manner frightful to behold.
 
"That fellow and gal are here, I spose," said he, sullenly, after a
pause.
 
"They are so," said Dorcas.
 
"Theyd better be off up to the lake," said Tom "the quicker the
better."
 
"Probably they will do so," said Aunt Dorcas, knitting peacefully.
 
"And hark ye," said Tom "weve got correspondents in Sandusky, that
watch the boats for us. I dont care if I tell, now. I hope they _will_
get away, just to spite Marks,the cursed puppy!dn him!"
 
"Thomas!" said Dorcas.
 
"I tell you, granny, if you bottle a fellow up too tight, I shall
split," said Tom. "But about the gal,tell em to dress her up some
way, sos to alter her. Her descriptions out in Sandusky."
 
"We will attend to that matter," said Dorcas, with characteristic
composure.
 
As we at this place take leave of Tom Loker, we may as well say, that,
having lain three weeks at the Quaker dwelling, sick with a rheumatic
fever, which set in, in company with his other afflictions, Tom
arose from his bed a somewhat sadder and wiser man and, in place of
slavecatching, betook himself to life in one of the new settlements,
where his talents developed themselves more happily in trapping bears,
wolves, and other inhabitants of the forest, in which he made himself
quite a name in the land. Tom always spoke reverently of the Quakers.
"Nice people," he would say "wanted to convert me, but couldnt come
it, exactly. But, tell ye what, stranger, they do fix up a sick fellow
first rate,no mistake. Make jist the tallest kind o broth and
knicknacks."
 
As Tom had informed them that their party would be looked for in
Sandusky, it was thought prudent to divide them. Jim, with his old
mother, was forwarded separately and a night or two after, George and
Eliza, with their child, were driven privately into Sandusky, and lodged
beneath a hospital roof, preparatory to taking their last passage on the
lake.
 
Their night was now far spent, and the morning star of liberty rose fair
before them!electric word! What is it? Is there anything more in it
than a namea rhetorical flourish? Why, men and women of America, does
your hearts blood thrill at that word, for which your fathers bled, and
your braver mothers were willing that their noblest and best should die?
 
Is there anything in it glorious and dear for a nation, that is not also
glorious and dear for a man? What is freedom to a nation, but freedom
to the individuals in it? What is freedom to that young man, who sits
there, with his arms folded over his broad chest, the tint of African
blood in his cheek, its dark fires in his eyes,what is freedom to
George Harris? To your fathers, freedom was the right of a nation to be
a nation. To him, it is the right of a man to be a man, and not a brute
the right to call the wife of his bosom his wife, and to protect her from
lawless violence the right to protect and educate his child the right
to have a home of his own, a religion of his own, a character of his
own, unsubject to the will of another. All these thoughts were rolling
and seething in Georges breast, as he was pensively leaning his head
on his hand, watching his wife, as she was adapting to her slender and
pretty form the articles of mans attire, in which it was deemed safest
she should make her escape.
 
"Now for it," said she, as she stood before the glass, and shook down
her silky abundance of black curly hair. "I say, George, its almost a
pity, isnt it," she said, as she held up some of it, playfully,"pity
its all got to come off?"
 
George smiled sadly, and made no answer.
 
Eliza turned to the glass, and the scissors glittered as one long lock
after another was detached from her head.
 
"There, now, thatll do," she said, taking up a hairbrush "now for a
few fancy touches."
 
"There, ant I a pretty young fellow?" she said, turning around to her
husband, laughing and blushing at the same time.
 
"You always will be pretty, do what you will," said George.
 
"What does make you so sober?" said Eliza, kneeling on one knee, and
laying her hand on his. "We are only within twentyfour hours of Canada,
they say. Only a day and a night on the lake, and thenoh, then!"
 
"O, Eliza!" said George, drawing her towards him "that is it! Now my
fate is all narrowing down to a point. To come so near, to be almost in
sight, and then lose all. I should never live under it, Eliza."
 
"Dont fear," said his wife, hopefully. "The good Lord would not have
brought us so far, if he didnt mean to carry us through. I seem to feel
him with us, George."
 
"You are a blessed woman, Eliza!" said George, clasping her with a
convulsive grasp. "But,oh, tell me! can this great mercy be for us?
Will these years and years of misery come to an end?shall we be free?
 
"I am sure of it, George," said Eliza, looking upward, while tears of
hope and enthusiasm shone on her long, dark lashes. "I feel it in me,
that God is going to bring us out of bondage, this very day."
 
"I will believe you, Eliza," said George, rising suddenly up, "I will
believe,come lets be off. Well, indeed," said he, holding her off at
arms length, and looking admiringly at her, "you _are_ a pretty little
fellow. That crop of little, short curls, is quite becoming. Put on your
cap. Soa little to one side. I never saw you look quite so pretty.
But, its almost time for the carriageI wonder if Mrs. Smyth has got
Harry rigged?"
 
The door opened, and a respectable, middleaged woman entered, leading
little Harry, dressed in girls clothes.
 
"What a pretty girl he makes," said Eliza, turning him round. "We call
him Harriet, you seedont the name come nicely?"
 
The child stood gravely regarding his mother in her new and strange
attire, observing a profound silence, and occasionally drawing deep
sighs, and peeping at her from under his dark curls.
 
"Does Harry know mamma?" said Eliza, stretching her hands toward him.
 
The child clung shyly to the woman.
 
"Come Eliza, why do you try to coax him, when you know that he has got
to be kept away from you?"
 
"I know its foolish," said Eliza "yet, I cant bear to have him turn
away from me. But come,wheres my cloak? Here,how is it men put on
cloaks, George?"
 
"You must wear it so," said her husband, throwing it over his shoulders.
 
"So, then," said Eliza, imitating the motion,"and I must stamp, and
take long steps, and try to look saucy."
 
"Dont exert yourself," said George. "There is, now and then, a
modest young man and I think it would be easier for you to act that
character."
 
"And these gloves! mercy upon us!" said Eliza "why, my hands are lost
in them."
 
"I advise you to keep them on pretty strictly," said George. "Your
slender paw might bring us all out. Now, Mrs. Smyth, you are to go under
our charge, and be our aunty,you mind."
 
"Ive heard," said Mrs. Smyth, "that there have been men down, warning
all the packet captains against a man and woman, with a little boy."
 
"They have!" said George. "Well, if we see any such people, we can tell
them."
 
A hack now drove to the door, and the friendly family who had received
the fugitives crowded around them with farewell greetings.
 
The disguises the party had assumed were in accordance with the hints
of Tom Loker. Mrs. Smyth, a respectable woman from the settlement in
Canada, whither they were fleeing, being fortunately about crossing the
lake to return thither, had consented to appear as the aunt of little
Harry and, in order to attach him to her, he had been allowed to
remain, the two last days, under her sole charge and an extra amount
of petting, jointed to an indefinite amount of seedcakes and candy, had
cemented a very close attachment on the part of the young gentleman.
 
The hack drove to the wharf. The two young men, as they appeared, walked
up the plank into the boat, Eliza gallantly giving her arm to Mrs.
Smyth, and George attending to their baggage.
 
George was standing at the captains office, settling for his party,
when he overheard two men talking by his side.
 
"Ive watched every one that came on board," said one, "and I know
theyre not on this boat."
 
The voice was that of the clerk of the boat. The speaker whom he
addressed was our sometime friend Marks, who, with that valuable
perseverance which characterized him, had come on to Sandusky, seeking
whom he might devour.
 
"You would scarcely know the woman from a white one," said Marks. "The
man is a very light mulatto he has a brand in one of his hands."
 
The hand with which George was taking the tickets and change trembled a
little but he turned coolly around, fixed an unconcerned glance on the
face of the speaker, and walked leisurely toward another part of the
boat, where Eliza stood waiting for him.
 
Mrs. Smyth, with little Harry, sought the seclusion of the ladies
cabin, where the dark beauty of the supposed little girl drew many
flattering comments from the passengers.
 
George had the satisfaction, as the bell rang out its farewell peal,
to see Marks walk down the plank to the shore and drew a long sigh of
relief, when the boat had put a returnless distance between them.
 
It was a superb day. The blue waves of Lake Erie danced, rippling and
sparkling, in the sunlight. A fresh breeze blew from the shore, and the
lordly boat ploughed her way right gallantly onward.
 
O, what an untold world there is in one human heart! Who thought, as
George walked calmly up and down the deck of the steamer, with his shy
companion at his side, of all that was burning in his bosom? The mighty
good that seemed approaching seemed too good, too fair, even to be a
reality and he felt a jealous dread, every moment of the day, that
something would rise to snatch it from him.
 
But the boat swept on. Hours fleeted, and, at last, clear and full rose
the blessed English shores shores charmed by a mighty spell,with
one touch to dissolve every incantation of slavery, no matter in what
language pronounced, or by what national power confirmed.
 
George and his wife stood arm in arm, as the boat neared the small
town of Amherstberg, in Canada. His breath grew thick and short a mist
gathered before his eyes he silently pressed the little hand that lay
trembling on his arm. The bell rang the boat stopped. Scarcely seeing
what he did, he looked out his baggage, and gathered his little party.
The little company were landed on the shore. They stood still till the
boat had cleared and then, with tears and embracings, the husband and
wife, with their wondering child in their arms, knelt down and lifted up
their hearts to God!
 
     "T was something like the burst from death to life
     From the graves cerements to the robes of heaven
     From sins dominion, and from passions strife,
     To the pure freedom of a soul forgiven
     Where all the bonds of death and hell are riven,
     And mortal puts on immortality,
     When Mercys hand hath turned the golden key,
     And Mercys voice hath said, _Rejoice, thy soul is free."_
 
The little party were soon guided, by Mrs. Smyth, to the hospitable
abode of a good missionary, whom Christian charity has placed here as
a shepherd to the outcast and wandering, who are constantly finding an
asylum on this shore.
 
Who can speak the blessedness of that first day of freedom? Is not the
_sense_ of liberty a higher and a finer one than any of the five? To
move, speak and breathe,go out and come in unwatched, and free from
danger! Who can speak the blessings of that rest which comes down on the
free mans pillow, under laws which insure to him the rights that God
has given to man? How fair and precious to that mother was that
sleeping childs face, endeared by the memory of a thousand dangers!
How impossible was it to sleep, in the exuberant possession of such
blessedness! And yet, these two had not one acre of ground,not a roof
that they could call their own,they had spent their all, to the last
dollar. They had nothing more than the birds of the air, or the flowers
of the field,yet they could not sleep for joy. "O, ye who take freedom
from man, with what words shall ye answer it to God?"
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXXVIII
 
The Victory
 
 
"Thanks be unto God, who giveth us the victory."
 
      I Cor. 1557.
 
Have not many of us, in the weary way of life, felt, in some hours, how
far easier it were to die than to live?
 
The martyr, when faced even by a death of bodily anguish and horror,
finds in the very terror of his doom a strong stimulant and tonic. There
is a vivid excitement, a thrill and fervor, which may carry through any
crisis of suffering that is the birthhour of eternal glory and rest.
 
But to live,to wear on, day after day, of mean, bitter, low, harassing
servitude, every nerve dampened and depressed, every power of feeling
gradually smothered,this long and wasting heartmartyrdom, this
slow, daily bleeding away of the inward life, drop by drop, hour after
hour,this is the true searching test of what there may be in man or
woman.
 
When Tom stood face to face with his persecutor, and heard his threats,
and thought in his very soul that his hour was come, his heart swelled
bravely in him, and he thought he could bear torture and fire, bear
anything, with the vision of Jesus and heaven but just a step beyond
but, when he was gone, and the present excitement passed off, came back
the pain of his bruised and weary limbs,came back the sense of his
utterly degraded, hopeless, forlorn estate and the day passed wearily
enough.
 
Long before his wounds were healed, Legree insisted that he should be
put to the regular fieldwork and then came day after day of pain and
weariness, aggravated by every kind of injustice and indignity that the
illwill of a mean and malicious mind could devise. Whoever, in _our_
circumstances, has made trial of pain, even with all the alleviations
which, for us, usually attend it, must know the irritation that comes
with it. Tom no longer wondered at the habitual surliness of his
associates nay, he found the placid, sunny temper, which had been the
habitude of his life, broken in on, and sorely strained, by the inroads
of the same thing. He had flattered himself on leisure to read his
Bible but there was no such thing as leisure there. In the height of
the season, Legree did not hesitate to press all his hands through,
Sundays and weekdays alike. Why shouldnt he?he made more cotton by
it, and gained his wager and if it wore out a few more hands, he could
buy better ones. At first, Tom used to read a verse or two of his Bible,
by the flicker of the fire, after he had returned from his daily toil
but, after the cruel treatment he received, he used to come home so
exhausted, that his head swam and his eyes failed when he tried to
read and he was fain to stretch himself down, with the others, in utter
exhaustion.
 
Is it strange that the religious peace and trust, which had upborne him
hitherto, should give way to tossings of soul and despondent darkness?
The gloomiest problem of this mysterious life was constantly before his
eyes,souls crushed and ruined, evil triumphant, and God silent. It
was weeks and months that Tom wrestled, in his own soul, in darkness and
sorrow. He thought of Miss Ophelias letter to his Kentucky friends, and
would pray earnestly that God would send him deliverance. And then he
would watch, day after day, in the vague hope of seeing somebody sent
to redeem him and, when nobody came, he would crush back to his soul
bitter thoughts,that it was vain to serve God, that God had forgotten
him. He sometimes saw Cassy and sometimes, when summoned to the house,
caught a glimpse of the dejected form of Emmeline, but held very little
communion with either in fact, there was no time for him to commune
with anybody.
 
One evening, he was sitting, in utter dejection and prostration, by a
few decaying brands, where his coarse supper was baking. He put a few
bits of brushwood on the fire, and strove to raise the light, and then
drew his worn Bible from his pocket. There were all the marked passages,
which had thrilled his soul so often,words of patriarchs and seers,
poets and sages, who from early time had spoken courage to man,voices
from the great cloud of witnesses who ever surround us in the race of
life. Had the word lost its power, or could the failing eye and weary
sense no longer answer to the touch of that mighty inspiration? Heavily
sighing, he put it in his pocket. A coarse laugh roused him he looked
up,Legree was standing opposite to him.
 
"Well, old boy," he said, "you find your religion dont work, it seems!
I thought I should get that through your wool, at last!"
 
The cruel taunt was more than hunger and cold and nakedness. Tom was
silent.
 
"You were a fool," said Legree "for I meant to do well by you, when I
bought you. You might have been better off than Sambo, or Quimbo either,
and had easy times and, instead of getting cut up and thrashed, every
day or two, ye might have had liberty to lord it round, and cut up the
other niggers and ye might have had, now and then, a good warming
of whiskey punch. Come, Tom, dont you think youd better be
reasonable?heave that ar old pack of trash in the fire, and join my
church!"
 
"The Lord forbid!" said Tom, fervently.
 
"You see the Lord ant going to help you if he had been, he wouldnt
have let _me_ get you! This yer religion is all a mess of lying
trumpery, Tom. I know all about it. Yed better hold to me Im
somebody, and can do something!"
 
"No, Masr," said Tom "Ill hold on. The Lord may help me, or not help
but Ill hold to him, and believe him to the last!"
 
"The more fool you!" said Legree, spitting scornfully at him, and
spurning him with his foot. "Never mind Ill chase you down, yet, and
bring you under,youll see!" and Legree turned away.
 
When a heavy weight presses the soul to the lowest level at which
endurance is possible, there is an instant and desperate effort of every
physical and moral nerve to throw off the weight and hence the heaviest
anguish often precedes a return tide of joy and courage. So was it
now with Tom. The atheistic taunts of his cruel master sunk his before
dejected soul to the lowest ebb and, though the hand of faith still
held to the eternal rock, it was a numb, despairing grasp. Tom sat, like
one stunned, at the fire. Suddenly everything around him seemed to fade,
and a vision rose before him of one crowned with thorns, buffeted and
bleeding. Tom gazed, in awe and wonder, at the majestic patience of the
face the deep, pathetic eyes thrilled him to his inmost heart his soul
woke, as, with floods of emotion, he stretched out his hands and fell
upon his knees,when, gradually, the vision changed the sharp thorns
became rays of glory and, in splendor inconceivable, he saw that same
face bending compassionately towards him, and a voice said, "He that
overcometh shall sit down with me on my throne, even as I also overcome,
and am set down with my Father on his throne."
 
How long Tom lay there, he knew not. When he came to himself, the fire
was gone out, his clothes were wet with the chill and drenching dews
but the dread soulcrisis was past, and, in the joy that filled him, he
no longer felt hunger, cold, degradation, disappointment, wretchedness.
From his deepest soul, he that hour loosed and parted from every hope in
life that now is, and offered his own will an unquestioning sacrifice to
the Infinite. Tom looked up to the silent, everliving stars,types
of the angelic hosts who ever look down on man and the solitude of the
night rung with the triumphant words of a hymn, which he had sung often
in happier days, but never with such feeling as now
 
    "The earth shall be dissolved like snow,
     The sun shall cease to shine
     But God, who called me here below,
     Shall be forever mine.
 
    "And when this mortal life shall fail,
     And flesh and sense shall cease,
     I shall possess within the veil
     A life of joy and peace.
 
    "When weve been there ten thousand years,
     Bright shining like the sun,
     Weve no less days to sing Gods praise
     Than when we first begun."
 
Those who have been familiar with the religious histories of the slave
population know that relations like what we have narrated are very
common among them. We have heard some from their own lips, of a very
touching and affecting character. The psychologist tells us of a state,
in which the affections and images of the mind become so dominant and
overpowering, that they press into their service the outward imagining.
Who shall measure what an allpervading Spirit may do with these
capabilities of our mortality, or the ways in which He may encourage the
desponding souls of the desolate? If the poor forgotten slave believes
that Jesus hath appeared and spoken to him, who shall contradict him?
Did He not say that his mission, in all ages, was to bind up the
brokenhearted, and set at liberty them that are bruised?
 
When the dim gray of dawn woke the slumberers to go forth to the field,
there was among those tattered and shivering wretches one who walked
with an exultant tread for firmer than the ground he trod on was his
strong faith in Almighty, eternal love. Ah, Legree, try all your forces
now! Utmost agony, woe, degradation, want, and loss of all things, shall
only hasten on the process by which he shall be made a king and a priest
unto God!
 
From this time, an inviolable sphere of peace encompassed the lowly
heart of the oppressed one,an everpresent Saviour hallowed it as a
temple. Past now the bleeding of earthly regrets past its fluctuations
of hope, and fear, and desire the human will, bent, and bleeding, and
struggling long, was now entirely merged in the Divine. So short now
seemed the remaining voyage of life,so near, so vivid, seemed eternal
blessedness,that lifes uttermost woes fell from him unharming.
 
All noticed the change in his appearance. Cheerfulness and alertness
seemed to return to him, and a quietness which no insult or injury could
ruffle seemed to possess him.
 
"What the devils got into Tom?" Legree said to Sambo. "A while ago he
was all down in the mouth, and now hes peart as a cricket."
 
"Dunno, Masr gwine to run off, mebbe."
 
"Like to see him try that," said Legree, with a savage grin, "wouldnt
we, Sambo?"
 
"Guess we would! Haw! haw! ho!" said the sooty gnome, laughing
obsequiously. "Lord, de fun! To see him stickin in de mud,chasin and
tarin through de bushes, dogs a holdin on to him! Lord, I laughed fit
to split, dat ar time we cotched Molly. I thought theyd a had her all
stripped up afore I could get em off. She cars de marks o dat ar
spree yet."
 
"I reckon she will, to her grave," said Legree. "But now, Sambo, you
look sharp. If the niggers got anything of this sort going, trip him
up."
 
"Masr, let me lone for dat," said Sambo, "Ill tree de coon. Ho, ho,
ho!"
 
This was spoken as Legree was getting on his horse, to go to the
neighboring town. That night, as he was returning, he thought he would
turn his horse and ride round the quarters, and see if all was safe.
 
It was a superb moonlight night, and the shadows of the graceful China
trees lay minutely pencilled on the turf below, and there was that
transparent stillness in the air which it seems almost unholy to
disturb. Legree was a little distance from the quarters, when he heard
the voice of some one singing. It was not a usual sound there, and he
paused to listen. A musical tenor voice sang,
 
     "When I can read my title clear
     To mansions in the skies,
     Ill bid farewell to every fear,
     And wipe my weeping eyes
 
     "Should earth against my soul engage,
     And hellish darts be hurled,
     Then I can smile at Satans rage,
     And face a frowning world.
 
     "Let cares like a wild deluge come,
     And storms of sorrow fall,
     May I but safely reach my home,
     My God, my Heaven, my All."
 
 
      "On My Journey Home," hymn by Isaac Watts, found in many
     of the southern country songbooks of the ante bellum period.
 
"So ho!" said Legree to himself, "he thinks so, does he? How I hate
these cursed Methodist hymns! Here, you nigger," said he, coming
suddenly out upon Tom, and raising his ridingwhip, "how dare you be
gettin up this yer row, when you ought to be in bed? Shut yer old black
gash, and get along in with you!"
 
"Yes, Masr," said Tom, with ready cheerfulness, as he rose to go in.
 
Legree was provoked beyond measure by Toms evident happiness and
riding up to him, belabored him over his head and shoulders.
 
"There, you dog," he said, "see if youll feel so comfortable, after
that!"
 
But the blows fell now only on the outer man, and not, as before, on
the heart. Tom stood perfectly submissive and yet Legree could not hide
from himself that his power over his bond thrall was somehow gone.
And, as Tom disappeared in his cabin, and he wheeled his horse suddenly
round, there passed through his mind one of those vivid flashes that
often send the lightning of conscience across the dark and wicked soul.
He understood full well that it was GOD who was standing between him and
his victim, and he blasphemed him. That submissive and silent man, whom
taunts, nor threats, nor stripes, nor cruelties, could disturb, roused a
voice within him, such as of old his Master roused in the demoniac soul,
saying, "What have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth?art thou
come to torment us before the time?"
 
Toms whole soul overflowed with compassion and sympathy for the
poor wretches by whom he was surrounded. To him it seemed as if his
lifesorrows were now over, and as if, out of that strange treasury of
peace and joy, with which he had been endowed from above, he longed
to pour out something for the relief of their woes. It is true,
opportunities were scanty but, on the way to the fields, and back
again, and during the hours of labor, chances fell in his way of
extending a helpinghand to the weary, the disheartened and discouraged.
The poor, worndown, brutalized creatures, at first, could scarce
comprehend this but, when it was continued week after week, and month
after month, it began to awaken longsilent chords in their benumbed
hearts. Gradually and imperceptibly the strange, silent, patient
man, who was ready to bear every ones burden, and sought help from
none,who stood aside for all, and came last, and took least, yet was
foremost to share his little all with any who needed,the man who, in
cold nights, would give up his tattered blanket to add to the comfort of
some woman who shivered with sickness, and who filled the baskets of the
weaker ones in the field, at the terrible risk of coming short in his
own measure,and who, though pursued with unrelenting cruelty by
their common tyrant, never joined in uttering a word of reviling or
cursing,this man, at last, began to have a strange power over them
and, when the more pressing season was past, and they were allowed again
their Sundays for their own use, many would gather together to hear from
him of Jesus. They would gladly have met to hear, and pray, and sing, in
some place, together but Legree would not permit it, and more than once
broke up such attempts, with oaths and brutal execrations,so that the
blessed news had to circulate from individual to individual. Yet who
can speak the simple joy with which some of those poor outcasts, to whom
life was a joyless journey to a dark unknown, heard of a compassionate
Redeemer and a heavenly home? It is the statement of missionaries, that,
of all races of the earth, none have received the Gospel with such eager
docility as the African. The principle of reliance and unquestioning
faith, which is its foundation, is more a native element in this race
than any other and it has often been found among them, that a stray
seed of truth, borne on some breeze of accident into hearts the most
ignorant, has sprung up into fruit, whose abundance has shamed that of
higher and more skilful culture.
 
The poor mulatto woman, whose simple faith had been wellnigh crushed
and overwhelmed, by the avalanche of cruelty and wrong which had fallen
upon her, felt her soul raised up by the hymns and passages of Holy
Writ, which this lowly missionary breathed into her ear in intervals, as
they were going to and returning from work and even the halfcrazed
and wandering mind of Cassy was soothed and calmed by his simple and
unobtrusive influences.
 
Stung to madness and despair by the crushing agonies of a life, Cassy
had often resolved in her soul an hour of retribution, when her hand
should avenge on her oppressor all the injustice and cruelty to which
she had been witness, or which _she_ had in her own person suffered.
 
One night, after all in Toms cabin were sunk in sleep, he was suddenly
aroused by seeing her face at the hole between the logs, that served for
a window. She made a silent gesture for him to come out.
 
Tom came out the door. It was between one and two oclock at
night,broad, calm, still moonlight. Tom remarked, as the light of
the moon fell upon Cassys large, black eyes, that there was a wild and
peculiar glare in them, unlike their wonted fixed despair.
 
"Come here, Father Tom," she said, laying her small hand on his wrist,
and drawing him forward with a force as if the hand were of steel "come
here,Ive news for you."
 
"What, Misse Cassy?" said Tom, anxiously.
 
"Tom, wouldnt you like your liberty?"
 
"I shall have it, Misse, in Gods time," said Tom. "Ay, but you may have
it tonight," said Cassy, with a flash of sudden energy. "Come on."
 
Tom hesitated.
 
"Come!" said she, in a whisper, fixing her black eyes on him. "Come
along! Hes asleepsound. I put enough into his brandy to keep him so.
I wish Id had more,I shouldnt have wanted you. But come, the back
door is unlocked theres an axe there, I put it there,his room door
is open Ill show you the way. Id a done it myself, only my arms are
so weak. Come along!"
 
"Not for ten thousand worlds, Misse!" said Tom, firmly, stopping and
holding her back, as she was pressing forward.
 
"But think of all these poor creatures," said Cassy. "We might set them
all free, and go somewhere in the swamps, and find an island, and live
by ourselves Ive heard of its being done. Any life is better than
this."
 
"No!" said Tom, firmly. "No! good never comes of wickedness. Id sooner
chop my right hand off!"
 
"Then _I_ shall do it," said Cassy, turning.
 
"O, Misse Cassy!" said Tom, throwing himself before her, "for the dear
Lords sake that died for ye, dont sell your precious soul to the
devil, that way! Nothing but evil will come of it. The Lord hasnt
called us to wrath. We must suffer, and wait his time."
 
"Wait!" said Cassy. "Havent I waited?waited till my head is dizzy and
my heart sick? What has he made me suffer? What has he made hundreds of
poor creatures suffer? Isnt he wringing the lifeblood out of you?
Im called on they call me! His times come, and Ill have his hearts
blood!"
 
"No, no, no!" said Tom, holding her small hands, which were clenched
with spasmodic violence. "No, ye poor, lost soul, that ye mustnt do.
The dear, blessed Lord never shed no blood but his own, and that he
poured out for us when we was enemies. Lord, help us to follow his
steps, and love our enemies."
 
"Love!" said Cassy, with a fierce glare "love _such_ enemies! It isnt
in flesh and blood."
 
"No, Misse, it isnt," said Tom, looking up "but _He_ gives it to us,
and thats the victory. When we can love and pray over all and through
all, the battles past, and the victorys come,glory be to God!"
And, with streaming eyes and choking voice, the black man looked up to
heaven.
 
And this, oh Africa! latest called of nations,called to the crown of
thorns, the scourge, the bloody sweat, the cross of agony,this is to
be _thy_ victory by this shalt thou reign with Christ when his kingdom
shall come on earth.
 
The deep fervor of Toms feelings, the softness of his voice, his
tears, fell like dew on the wild, unsettled spirit of the poor woman. A
softness gathered over the lurid fires of her eye she looked down, and
Tom could feel the relaxing muscles of her hands, as she said,
 
"Didnt I tell you that evil spirits followed me? O! Father Tom, I cant
pray,I wish I could. I never have prayed since my children were sold!
What you say must be right, I know it must but when I try to pray, I
can only hate and curse. I cant pray!"
 
"Poor soul!" said Tom, compassionately. "Satan desires to have ye, and
sift ye as wheat. I pray the Lord for ye. O! Misse Cassy, turn to the
dear Lord Jesus. He came to bind up the brokenhearted, and comfort all
that mourn."
 
Cassy stood silent, while large, heavy tears dropped from her downcast
eyes.
 
"Misse Cassy," said Tom, in a hesitating tone, after surveying her
in silence, "if ye only could get away from here,if the thing was
possible,Id vise ye and Emmeline to do it that is, if ye could go
without bloodguiltiness,not otherwise."
 
"Would you try it with us, Father Tom?"
 
"No," said Tom "time was when I would but the Lords given me a work
among these yer poor souls, and Ill stay with em and bear my cross
with em till the end. Its different with you its a snare to
you,its moren you can stand,and youd better go, if you can."
 
"I know no way but through the grave," said Cassy. "Theres no beast or
bird but can find a home some where even the snakes and the alligators
have their places to lie down and be quiet but theres no place for us.
Down in the darkest swamps, their dogs will hunt us out, and find
us. Everybody and everything is against us even the very beasts side
against us,and where shall we go?"
 
Tom stood silent at length he said,
 
"Him that saved Daniel in the den of lions,that saved the children in
the fiery furnace,Him that walked on the sea, and bade the winds be
still,Hes alive yet and Ive faith to believe he can deliver you.
Try it, and Ill pray, with all my might, for you."
 
By what strange law of mind is it that an idea long overlooked, and
trodden under foot as a useless stone, suddenly sparkles out in new
light, as a discovered diamond?
 
Cassy had often revolved, for hours, all possible or probable schemes
of escape, and dismissed them all, as hopeless and impracticable but
at this moment there flashed through her mind a plan, so simple and
feasible in all its details, as to awaken an instant hope.
 
"Father Tom, Ill try it!" she said, suddenly.
 
"Amen!" said Tom "the Lord help ye!"
 
 
 
CHAPTER XXXIX
 
The Stratagem
 
"The way of the wicked is as darkness he knoweth not at what he
stumbleth."
 
      Prov. 419.
 
The garret of the house that Legree occupied, like most other garrets,
was a great, desolate space, dusty, hung with cobwebs, and littered with
castoff lumber. The opulent family that had inhabited the house in the
days of its splendor had imported a great deal of splendid furniture,
some of which they had taken away with them, while some remained
standing desolate in mouldering, unoccupied rooms, or stored away in
this place. One or two immense packingboxes, in which this furniture
was brought, stood against the sides of the garret. There was a small
window there, which let in, through its dingy, dusty panes, a scanty,
uncertain light on the tall, highbacked chairs and dusty tables, that
had once seen better days. Altogether, it was a weird and ghostly place
but, ghostly as it was, it wanted not in legends among the superstitious
negroes, to increase its terrors. Some few years before, a negro woman,
who had incurred Legrees displeasure, was confined there for several
weeks. What passed there, we do not say the negroes used to whisper
darkly to each other but it was known that the body of the unfortunate
creature was one day taken down from there, and buried and, after that,
it was said that oaths and cursings, and the sound of violent blows,
used to ring through that old garret, and mingled with wailings and
groans of despair. Once, when Legree chanced to overhear something of
this kind, he flew into a violent passion, and swore that the next
one that told stories about that garret should have an opportunity of
knowing what was there, for he would chain them up there for a week.
This hint was enough to repress talking, though, of course, it did not
disturb the credit of the story in the least.
 
Gradually, the staircase that led to the garret, and even the
passageway to the staircase, were avoided by every one in the house,
from every one fearing to speak of it, and the legend was gradually
falling into desuetude. It had suddenly occurred to Cassy to make use
of the superstitious excitability, which was so great in Legree, for the
purpose of her liberation, and that of her fellowsufferer.
 
The sleepingroom of Cassy was directly under the garret. One day,
without consulting Legree, she suddenly took it upon her, with some
considerable ostentation, to change all the furniture and appurtenances
of the room to one at some considerable distance. The underservants,
who were called on to effect this movement, were running and bustling
about with great zeal and confusion, when Legree returned from a ride.
 
"Hallo! you Cass!" said Legree, "whats in the wind now?"
 
"Nothing only I choose to have another room," said Cassy, doggedly.
 
"And what for, pray?" said Legree.
 
"I choose to," said Cassy.
 
"The devil you do! and what for?"
 
"Id like to get some sleep, now and then."
 
"Sleep! well, what hinders your sleeping?"
 
"I could tell, I suppose, if you want to hear," said Cassy, dryly.
 
"Speak out, you minx!" said Legree.
 
"O! nothing. I suppose it wouldnt disturb _you!_ Only groans, and
people scuffing, and rolling round on the garret floor, half the night,
from twelve to morning!"
 
"People up garret!" said Legree, uneasily, but forcing a laugh "who are
they, Cassy?"
 
Cassy raised her sharp, black eyes, and looked in the face of Legree,
with an expression that went through his bones, as she said, "To be
sure, Simon, who are they? Id like to have _you_ tell me. You dont
know, I suppose!"
 
With an oath, Legree struck at her with his ridingwhip but she glided
to one side, and passed through the door, and looking back, said, "If
youll sleep in that room, youll know all about it. Perhaps youd
better try it!" and then immediately she shut and locked the door.
 
Legree blustered and swore, and threatened to break down the door
but apparently thought better of it, and walked uneasily into the
sittingroom. Cassy perceived that her shaft had struck home and, from
that hour, with the most exquisite address, she never ceased to continue
the train of influences she had begun.
 
In a knothole of the garret, that had opened, she had inserted the neck
of an old bottle, in such a manner that when there was the least wind,
most doleful and lugubrious wailing sounds proceeded from it, which,
in a high wind, increased to a perfect shriek, such as to credulous and
superstitious ears might easily seem to be that of horror and despair.
 
These sounds were, from time to time, heard by the servants, and revived
in full force the memory of the old ghost legend. A superstitious
creeping horror seemed to fill the house and though no one dared to
breathe it to Legree, he found himself encompassed by it, as by an
atmosphere.
 
No one is so thoroughly superstitious as the godless man. The Christian
is composed by the belief of a wise, allruling Father, whose presence
fills the void unknown with light and order but to the man who has
dethroned God, the spiritland is, indeed, in the words of the Hebrew
poet, "a land of darkness and the shadow of death," without any order,
where the light is as darkness. Life and death to him are haunted
grounds, filled with goblin forms of vague and shadowy dread.
 
Legree had had the slumbering moral elements in him roused by his
encounters with Tom,roused, only to be resisted by the determinate
force of evil but still there was a thrill and commotion of the dark,
inner world, produced by every word, or prayer, or hymn, that reacted in
superstitious dread.
 
The influence of Cassy over him was of a strange and singular kind. He
was her owner, her tyrant and tormentor. She was, as he knew, wholly,
and without any possibility of help or redress, in his hands and yet so
it is, that the most brutal man cannot live in constant association with
a strong female influence, and not be greatly controlled by it. When
he first bought her, she was, as she said, a woman delicately bred and
then he crushed her, without scruple, beneath the foot of his brutality.
But, as time, and debasing influences, and despair, hardened womanhood
within her, and waked the fires of fiercer passions, she had become in
a measure his mistress, and he alternately tyrannized over and dreaded
her.
 
This influence had become more harassing and decided, since partial
insanity had given a strange, weird, unsettled cast to all her words and
language.
 
A night or two after this, Legree was sitting in the old sittingroom,
by the side of a flickering wood fire, that threw uncertain glances
round the room. It was a stormy, windy night, such as raises whole
squadrons of nondescript noises in rickety old houses. Windows were
rattling, shutters flapping, and wind carousing, rumbling, and tumbling
down the chimney, and, every once in a while, puffing out smoke and
ashes, as if a legion of spirits were coming after them. Legree had been
casting up accounts and reading newspapers for some hours, while Cassy
sat in the corner sullenly looking into the fire. Legree laid down his
paper, and seeing an old book lying on the table, which he had noticed
Cassy reading, the first part of the evening, took it up, and began
to turn it over. It was one of those collections of stories of bloody
murders, ghostly legends, and supernatural visitations, which, coarsely
got up and illustrated, have a strange fascination for one who once
begins to read them.
 
Legree poohed and pished, but read, turning page after page, till,
finally, after reading some way, he threw down the book, with an oath.
 
"You dont believe in ghosts, do you, Cass?" said he, taking the tongs
and settling the fire. "I thought youd more sense than to let noises
scare _you_."
 
"No matter what I believe," said Cassy, sullenly.
 
"Fellows used to try to frighten me with their yarns at sea," said
Legree. "Never come it round me that way. Im too tough for any such
trash, tell ye."
 
Cassy sat looking intensely at him in the shadow of the corner. There
was that strange light in her eyes that always impressed Legree with
uneasiness.
 
"Them noises was nothing but rats and the wind," said Legree. "Rats will
make a devil of a noise. I used to hear em sometimes down in the hold
of the ship and wind,Lords sake! ye can make anything out o wind."
 
Cassy knew Legree was uneasy under her eyes, and, therefore, she made
no answer, but sat fixing them on him, with that strange, unearthly
expression, as before.
 
"Come, speak out, woman,dont you think so?" said Legree.
 
"Can rats walk down stairs, and come walking through the entry, and open
a door when youve locked it and set a chair against it?" said Cassy
"and come walk, walk, walking right up to your bed, and put out their
hand, so?"
 
Cassy kept her glittering eyes fixed on Legree, as she spoke, and he
stared at her like a man in the nightmare, till, when she finished by
laying her hand, icy cold, on his, he sprung back, with an oath.
 
"Woman! what do you mean? Nobody did?"
 
"O, no,of course not,did I say they did?" said Cassy, with a smile
of chilling derision.
 
"Butdidhave you really seen?Come, Cass, what is it, now,speak
out!"
 
"You may sleep there, yourself," said Cassy, "if you want to know."
 
"Did it come from the garret, Cassy?"
 
"_It_,what?" said Cassy.
 
"Why, what you told of"
 
"I didnt tell you anything," said Cassy, with dogged sullenness.
 
Legree walked up and down the room, uneasily.
 
"Ill have this yer thing examined. Ill look into it, this very night.
Ill take my pistols"
 
"Do," said Cassy "sleep in that room. Id like to see you doing it.
Fire your pistols,do!"
 
Legree stamped his foot, and swore violently.
 
"Dont swear," said Cassy "nobody knows who may be hearing you. Hark!
What was that?"
 
"What?" said Legree, starting.
 
A heavy old Dutch clock, that stood in the corner of the room, began,
and slowly struck twelve.
 
For some reason or other, Legree neither spoke nor moved a vague horror
fell on him while Cassy, with a keen, sneering glitter in her eyes,
stood looking at him, counting the strokes.
 
"Twelve oclock well _now_ well see," said she, turning, and opening
the door into the passageway, and standing as if listening.
 
"Hark! Whats that?" said she, raising her finger.
 
"Its only the wind," said Legree. "Dont you hear how cursedly it
blows?"
 
"Simon, come here," said Cassy, in a whisper, laying her hand on his,
and leading him to the foot of the stairs "do you know what _that_ is?
Hark!"
 
A wild shriek came pealing down the stairway. It came from the garret.
Legrees knees knocked together his face grew white with fear.
 
"Hadnt you better get your pistols?" said Cassy, with a sneer that
froze Legrees blood. "Its time this thing was looked into, you know.
Id like to have you go up now _theyre at it_."
 
"I wont go!" said Legree, with an oath.
 
"Why not? There ant any such thing as ghosts, you know! Come!" and
Cassy flitted up the winding stairway, laughing, and looking back after
him. "Come on."
 
"I believe you _are_ the devil!" said Legree. "Come back you hag,come
back, Cass! You shant go!"
 
But Cassy laughed wildly, and fled on. He heard her open the entry doors
that led to the garret. A wild gust of wind swept down, extinguishing
the candle he held in his hand, and with it the fearful, unearthly
screams they seemed to be shrieked in his very ear.
 
Legree fled frantically into the parlor, whither, in a few moments, he
was followed by Cassy, pale, calm, cold as an avenging spirit, and with
that same fearful light in her eye.
 
"I hope you are satisfied," said she.
 
"Blast you, Cass!" said Legree.
 
"What for?" said Cassy. "I only went up and shut the doors. _Whats the
matter with that garret_, Simon, do you suppose?" said she.
 
"None of your business!" said Legree.
 
"O, it ant? Well," said Cassy, "at any rate, Im glad _I_ dont sleep
under it."
 
Anticipating the rising of the wind, that very evening, Cassy had been
up and opened the garret window. Of course, the moment the doors were
opened, the wind had drafted down, and extinguished the light.
 
This may serve as a specimen of the game that Cassy played with Legree,
until he would sooner have put his head into a lions mouth than to have
explored that garret. Meanwhile, in the night, when everybody else
was asleep, Cassy slowly and carefully accumulated there a stock
of provisions sufficient to afford subsistence for some time she
transferred, article by article, a greater part of her own and
Emmelines wardrobe. All things being arranged, they only waited a
fitting opportunity to put their plan in execution.
 
By cajoling Legree, and taking advantage of a goodnatured interval,
Cassy had got him to take her with him to the neighboring town, which
was situated directly on the Red River. With a memory sharpened to
almost preternatural clearness, she remarked every turn in the road, and
formed a mental estimate of the time to be occupied in traversing it.
 
At the time when all was matured for action, our readers may, perhaps,
like to look behind the scenes, and see the final _coup detat_.
 
It was now near evening, Legree had been absent, on a ride to a
neighboring farm. For many days Cassy had been unusually gracious and
accommodating in her humors and Legree and she had been, apparently,
on the best of terms. At present, we may behold her and Emmeline in the
room of the latter, busy in sorting and arranging two small bundles.
 
"There, these will be large enough," said Cassy. "Now put on your bonnet,
and lets start its just about the right time."
 
"Why, they can see us yet," said Emmeline.
 
"I mean they shall," said Cassy, coolly. "Dont you know that they must
have their chase after us, at any rate? The way of the thing is to be
just thisWe will steal out of the back door, and run down by the
quarters. Sambo or Quimbo will be sure to see us. They will give chase,
and we will get into the swamp then, they cant follow us any further
till they go up and give the alarm, and turn out the dogs, and so on
and, while they are blundering round, and tumbling over each other, as
they always do, you and I will slip along to the creek, that runs back
of the house, and wade along in it, till we get opposite the back door.
That will put the dogs all at fault for scent wont lie in the water.
Every one will run out of the house to look after us, and then well
whip in at the back door, and up into the garret, where Ive got a nice
bed made up in one of the great boxes. We must stay in that garret a
good while, for, I tell you, he will raise heaven and earth after us.
Hell muster some of those old overseers on the other plantations, and
have a great hunt and theyll go over every inch of ground in that
swamp. He makes it his boast that nobody ever got away from him. So let
him hunt at his leisure."
 
"Cassy, how well you have planned it!" said Emmeline. "Who ever would
have thought of it, but you?"
 
There was neither pleasure nor exultation in Cassys eyes,only a
despairing firmness.
 
"Come," she said, reaching her hand to Emmeline.
 
The two fugitives glided noiselessly from the house, and flitted,
through the gathering shadows of evening, along by the quarters. The
crescent moon, set like a silver signet in the western sky, delayed a
little the approach of night. As Cassy expected, when quite near the
verge of the swamps that encircled the plantation, they heard a voice
calling to them to stop. It was not Sambo, however, but Legree, who was
pursuing them with violent execrations. At the sound, the feebler spirit
of Emmeline gave way and, laying hold of Cassys arm, she said, "O,
Cassy, Im going to faint!"
 
"If you do, Ill kill you!" said Cassy, drawing a small, glittering
stiletto, and flashing it before the eyes of the girl.
 
The diversion accomplished the purpose. Emmeline did not faint, and
succeeded in plunging, with Cassy, into a part of the labyrinth of
swamp, so deep and dark that it was perfectly hopeless for Legree to
think of following them, without assistance.
 
"Well," said he, chuckling brutally "at any rate, theyve got
themselves into a trap nowthe baggage! Theyre safe enough. They shall
sweat for it!"
 
"Hulloa, there! Sambo! Quimbo! All hands!" called Legree, coming to the
quarters, when the men and women were just returning from work. "Theres
two runaways in the swamps. Ill give five dollars to any nigger as
catches em. Turn out the dogs! Turn out Tiger, and Fury, and the rest!"
 
The sensation produced by this news was immediate. Many of the men
sprang forward, officiously, to offer their services, either from the
hope of the reward, or from that cringing subserviency which is one of
the most baleful effects of slavery. Some ran one way, and some another.
Some were for getting flambeaux of pineknots. Some were uncoupling the
dogs, whose hoarse, savage bay added not a little to the animation of
the scene.
 
"Masr, shall we shoot em, if cant cotch em?" said Sambo, to whom his
master brought out a rifle.
 
"You may fire on Cass, if you like its time she was gone to the devil,
where she belongs but the gal, not," said Legree. "And now, boys,
be spry and smart. Five dollars for him that gets em and a glass of
spirits to every one of you, anyhow."
 
The whole band, with the glare of blazing torches, and whoop, and
shout, and savage yell, of man and beast, proceeded down to the
swamp, followed, at some distance, by every servant in the house. The
establishment was, of a consequence, wholly deserted, when Cassy and
Emmeline glided into it the back way. The whooping and shouts of their
pursuers were still filling the air and, looking from the sittingroom
windows, Cassy and Emmeline could see the troop, with their flambeaux,
just dispersing themselves along the edge of the swamp.
 
"See there!" said Emmeline, pointing to Cassy "the hunt is begun! Look
how those lights dance about! Hark! the dogs! Dont you hear? If we were
only _there_, our chances wouldnt be worth a picayune. O, for pitys
sake, do lets hide ourselves. Quick!"
 
"Theres no occasion for hurry," said Cassy, coolly "they are all
out after the hunt,thats the amusement of the evening! Well go up
stairs, by and by. Meanwhile," said she, deliberately taking a key
from the pocket of a coat that Legree had thrown down in his hurry,
"meanwhile I shall take something to pay our passage."
 
She unlocked the desk, took from it a roll of bills, which she counted
over rapidly.
 
"O, dont lets do that!" said Emmeline.
 
"Dont!" said Cassy "why not? Would you have us starve in the swamps,
or have that that will pay our way to the free states. Money will do
anything, girl." And, as she spoke, she put the money in her bosom.
 
"It would be stealing," said Emmeline, in a distressed whisper.
 
"Stealing!" said Cassy, with a scornful laugh. "They who steal body and
soul neednt talk to us. Every one of these bills is stolen,stolen
from poor, starving, sweating creatures, who must go to the devil at
last, for his profit. Let _him_ talk about stealing! But come, we may as
well go up garret Ive got a stock of candles there, and some books to
pass away the time. You may be pretty sure they wont come _there_ to
inquire after us. If they do, Ill play ghost for them."
 
When Emmeline reached the garret, she found an immense box, in which
some heavy pieces of furniture had once been brought, turned on its
side, so that the opening faced the wall, or rather the eaves. Cassy
lit a small lamp, and creeping round under the eaves, they established
themselves in it. It was spread with a couple of small mattresses
and some pillows a box near by was plentifully stored with candles,
provisions, and all the clothing necessary to their journey, which Cassy
had arranged into bundles of an astonishingly small compass.
 
"There," said Cassy, as she fixed the lamp into a small hook, which she
had driven into the side of the box for that purpose "this is to be our
home for the present. How do you like it?"
 
"Are you sure they wont come and search the garret?"
 
"Id like to see Simon Legree doing that," said Cassy. "No, indeed he
will be too glad to keep away. As to the servants, they would any of
them stand and be shot, sooner than show their faces here."
 
Somewhat reassured, Emmeline settled herself back on her pillow.
 
"What did you mean, Cassy, by saying you would kill me?" she said,
simply.
 
"I meant to stop your fainting," said Cassy, "and I did do it. And now I
tell you, Emmeline, you must make up your mind _not_ to faint, let what
will come theres no sort of need of it. If I had not stopped you, that
wretch might have had his hands on you now."
 
Emmeline shuddered.
 
The two remained some time in silence. Cassy busied herself with a
French book Emmeline, overcome with the exhaustion, fell into a doze,
and slept some time. She was awakened by loud shouts and outcries, the
tramp of horses feet, and the baying of dogs. She started up, with a
faint shriek.
 
"Only the hunt coming back," said Cassy, coolly "never fear. Look out
of this knothole. Dont you see em all down there? Simon has to give
up, for this night. Look, how muddy his horse is, flouncing about in the
swamp the dogs, too, look rather crestfallen. Ah, my good sir, youll
have to try the race again and again,the game isnt there."
 
"O, dont speak a word!" said Emmeline "what if they should hear you?"
 
"If they do hear anything, it will make them very particular to keep
away," said Cassy. "No danger we may make any noise we please, and it
will only add to the effect."
 
At length the stillness of midnight settled down over the house. Legree,
cursing his ill luck, and vowing dire vengeance on the morrow, went to
bed.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XL
 
The Martyr
 
     "Deem not the just by Heaven forgot!
     Though life its common gifts deny,
     Though, with a crushed and bleeding heart,
     And spurned of man, he goes to die!
     For God hath marked each sorrowing day,
     And numbered every bitter tear,
     And heavens long years of bliss shall pay
     For all his children suffer here."
     BRYANT.
 
 
      This poem does not appear in the collected works of
     William Cullen Bryant, nor in the collected poems of his
     brother, John Howard Bryant.  It was probably copied from a
     newspaper or magazine.
 
The longest way must have its close,the gloomiest night will wear on
to a morning. An eternal, inexorable lapse of moments is ever hurrying
the day of the evil to an eternal night, and the night of the just to
an eternal day. We have walked with our humble friend thus far in the
valley of slavery first through flowery fields of ease and indulgence,
then through heartbreaking separations from all that man holds dear.
Again, we have waited with him in a sunny island, where generous hands
concealed his chains with flowers and, lastly, we have followed him
when the last ray of earthly hope went out in night, and seen how,
in the blackness of earthly darkness, the firmament of the unseen has
blazed with stars of new and significant lustre.
 
The morningstar now stands over the tops of the mountains, and gales
and breezes, not of earth, show that the gates of day are unclosing.
 
The escape of Cassy and Emmeline irritated the before surly temper of
Legree to the last degree and his fury, as was to be expected, fell
upon the defenceless head of Tom. When he hurriedly announced the
tidings among his hands, there was a sudden light in Toms eye, a sudden
upraising of his hands, that did not escape him. He saw that he did not
join the muster of the pursuers. He thought of forcing him to do it
but, having had, of old, experience of his inflexibility when commanded
to take part in any deed of inhumanity, he would not, in his hurry, stop
to enter into any conflict with him.
 
Tom, therefore, remained behind, with a few who had learned of him to
pray, and offered up prayers for the escape of the fugitives.
 
When Legree returned, baffled and disappointed, all the longworking
hatred of his soul towards his slave began to gather in a deadly and
desperate form. Had not this man braved him,steadily, powerfully,
resistlessly,ever since he bought him? Was there not a spirit in him
which, silent as it was, burned on him like the fires of perdition?
 
"I _hate_ him!" said Legree, that night, as he sat up in his bed "I
_hate_ him! And isnt he MINE? Cant I do what I like with him? Whos to
hinder, I wonder?" And Legree clenched his fist, and shook it, as if he
had something in his hands that he could rend in pieces.
 
But, then, Tom was a faithful, valuable servant and, although Legree
hated him the more for that, yet the consideration was still somewhat of
a restraint to him.
 
The next morning, he determined to say nothing, as yet to assemble
a party, from some neighboring plantations, with dogs and guns
to surround the swamp, and go about the hunt systematically. If it
succeeded, well and good if not, he would summon Tom before him,
andhis teeth clenched and his blood boiled_then_ he would break
the fellow down, orthere was a dire inward whisper, to which his soul
assented.
 
Ye say that the _interest_ of the master is a sufficient safeguard for
the slave. In the fury of mans mad will, he will wittingly, and with
open eye, sell his own soul to the devil to gain his ends and will he
be more careful of his neighbors body?
 
"Well," said Cassy, the next day, from the garret, as she reconnoitred
through the knothole, "the hunts going to begin again, today!"
 
Three or four mounted horsemen were curvetting about, on the space
in front of the house and one or two leashes of strange dogs were
struggling with the negroes who held them, baying and barking at each
other.
 
The men are, two of them, overseers of plantations in the vicinity
and others were some of Legrees associates at the tavernbar of a
neighboring city, who had come for the interest of the sport. A more
hardfavored set, perhaps, could not be imagined. Legree was serving
brandy, profusely, round among them, as also among the negroes, who had
been detailed from the various plantations for this service for it was
an object to make every service of this kind, among the negroes, as much
of a holiday as possible.
 
Cassy placed her ear at the knothole and, as the morning air blew
directly towards the house, she could overhear a good deal of the
conversation. A grave sneer overcast the dark, severe gravity of her
face, as she listened, and heard them divide out the ground, discuss the
rival merits of the dogs, give orders about firing, and the treatment of
each, in case of capture.
 
Cassy drew back and, clasping her hands, looked upward, and said, "O,
great Almighty God! we are _all_ sinners but what have _we_ done, more
than all the rest of the world, that we should be treated so?"
 
There was a terrible earnestness in her face and voice, as she spoke.
 
"If it wasnt for _you_, child," she said, looking at Emmeline, "Id
_go_ out to them and Id thank any one of them that _would_ shoot
me down for what use will freedom be to me? Can it give me back my
children, or make me what I used to be?"
 
Emmeline, in her childlike simplicity, was half afraid of the dark
moods of Cassy. She looked perplexed, but made no answer. She only took
her hand, with a gentle, caressing movement.
 
"Dont!" said Cassy, trying to draw it away "youll get me to loving
you and I never mean to love anything, again!"
 
"Poor Cassy!" said Emmeline, "dont feel so! If the Lord gives us
liberty, perhaps hell give you back your daughter at any rate, Ill be
like a daughter to you. I know Ill never see my poor old mother again!
I shall love you, Cassy, whether you love me or not!"
 
The gentle, childlike spirit conquered. Cassy sat down by her, put
her arm round her neck, stroked her soft, brown hair and Emmeline then
wondered at the beauty of her magnificent eyes, now soft with tears.
 
"O, Em!" said Cassy, "Ive hungered for my children, and thirsted for
them, and my eyes fail with longing for them! Here! here!" she said,
striking her breast, "its all desolate, all empty! If God would give me
back my children, then I could pray."
 
"You must trust him, Cassy," said Emmeline "he is our Father!"
 
"His wrath is upon us," said Cassy "he has turned away in anger."
 
"No, Cassy! He will be good to us! Let us hope in Him," said
Emmeline,"I always have had hope."
 
 
The hunt was long, animated, and thorough, but unsuccessful and, with
grave, ironic exultation, Cassy looked down on Legree, as, weary and
dispirited, he alighted from his horse.
 
"Now, Quimbo," said Legree, as he stretched himself down in the
sittingroom, "you jest go and walk that Tom up here, right away! The
old cuss is at the bottom of this yer whole matter and Ill have it out
of his old black hide, or Ill know the reason why!"
 
Sambo and Quimbo, both, though hating each other, were joined in one
mind by a no less cordial hatred of Tom. Legree had told them, at first,
that he had bought him for a general overseer, in his absence and this
had begun an ill will, on their part, which had increased, in their
debased and servile natures, as they saw him becoming obnoxious to
their masters displeasure. Quimbo, therefore, departed, with a will, to
execute his orders.
 
Tom heard the message with a forewarning heart for he knew all the
plan of the fugitives escape, and the place of their present
concealmenthe knew the deadly character of the man he had to deal
with, and his despotic power. But he felt strong in God to meet death,
rather than betray the helpless.
 
He sat his basket down by the row, and, looking up, said, "Into thy
hands I commend my spirit! Thou hast redeemed me, oh Lord God of truth!"
and then quietly yielded himself to the rough, brutal grasp with which
Quimbo seized him.
 
"Ay, ay!" said the giant, as he dragged him along "yell cotch it, now!
Ill boun Masrs back s up _high!_ No sneaking out, now! Tell ye,
yell get it, and no mistake! See how yell look, now, helpin Masrs
niggers to run away! See what yell get!"
 
The savage words none of them reached that ear!a higher voice there
was saying, "Fear not them that kill the body, and, after that, have no
more that they can do." Nerve and bone of that poor mans body vibrated
to those words, as if touched by the finger of God and he felt the
strength of a thousand souls in one. As he passed along, the trees and
bushes, the huts of his servitude, the whole scene of his degradation,
seemed to whirl by him as the landscape by the rushing ear. His soul
throbbed,his home was in sight,and the hour of release seemed at
hand.
 
"Well, Tom!" said Legree, walking up, and seizing him grimly by the
collar of his coat, and speaking through his teeth, in a paroxysm of
determined rage, "do you know Ive made up my mind to KILL YOU?"
 
"Its very likely, Masr," said Tom, calmly.
 
"I _have_," said Legree, with a grim, terrible calmness,
"_donejustthatthing_, Tom, unless youll tell me what you know
about these yer gals!"
 
Tom stood silent.
 
"Dye hear?" said Legree, stamping, with a roar like that of an incensed
lion. "Speak!"
 
"_I hant got nothing to tell, Masr_," said Tom, with a slow, firm,
deliberate utterance.
 
"Do you dare to tell me, ye old black Christian, ye dont _know_?" said
Legree.
 
Tom was silent.
 
"Speak!" thundered Legree, striking him furiously. "Do you know
anything?"
 
"I know, Masr but I cant tell anything. _I can die!_"
 
Legree drew in a long breath and, suppressing his rage, took Tom by the
arm, and, approaching his face almost to his, said, in a terrible voice,
"Hark e, Tom!ye think, cause Ive let you off before, I dont mean
what I say but, this time, _Ive made up my mind_, and counted the
cost. Youve always stood it out again me now, _Ill conquer ye, or
kill ye!_one or t other. Ill count every drop of blood there is in
you, and take em, one by one, till ye give up!"
 
Tom looked up to his master, and answered, "Masr, if you was sick,
or in trouble, or dying, and I could save ye, Id _give_ ye my hearts
blood and, if taking every drop of blood in this poor old body would
save your precious soul, Id give em freely, as the Lord gave his for
me. O, Masr! dont bring this great sin on your soul! It will hurt you
more than t will me! Do the worst you can, my troublesll be over soon
but, if ye dont repent, yours wont _never_ end!"
 
Like a strange snatch of heavenly music, heard in the lull of a tempest,
this burst of feeling made a moments blank pause. Legree stood aghast,
and looked at Tom and there was such a silence, that the tick of the
old clock could be heard, measuring, with silent touch, the last moments
of mercy and probation to that hardened heart.
 
It was but a moment. There was one hesitating pause,one irresolute,
relenting thrill,and the spirit of evil came back, with sevenfold
vehemence and Legree, foaming with rage, smote his victim to the
ground.
 
 
Scenes of blood and cruelty are shocking to our ear and heart. What
man has nerve to do, man has not nerve to hear. What brotherman and
brotherChristian must suffer, cannot be told us, even in our secret
chamber, it so harrows the soul! And yet, oh my country! these things
are done under the shadow of thy laws! O, Christ! thy church sees them,
almost in silence!
 
But, of old, there was One whose suffering changed an instrument of
torture, degradation and shame, into a symbol of glory, honor, and
immortal life and, where His spirit is, neither degrading stripes, nor
blood, nor insults, can make the Christians last struggle less than
glorious.
 
Was he alone, that long night, whose brave, loving spirit was bearing
up, in that old shed, against buffeting and brutal stripes?
 
Nay! There stood by him ONE,seen by him alone,"like unto the Son of
God."
 
The tempter stood by him, too,blinded by furious, despotic
will,every moment pressing him to shun that agony by the betrayal of
the innocent. But the brave, true heart was firm on the Eternal Rock.
Like his Master, he knew that, if he saved others, himself he could not
save nor could utmost extremity wring from him words, save of prayers
and holy trust.
 
"Hes most gone, Masr," said Sambo, touched, in spite of himself, by
the patience of his victim.
 
"Pay away, till he gives up! Give it to him!give it to him!" shouted
Legree. "Ill take every drop of blood he has, unless he confesses!"
 
Tom opened his eyes, and looked upon his master. "Ye poor miserable
critter!" he said, "there aint no more ye can do! I forgive ye, with
all my soul!" and he fainted entirely away.
 
"I blieve, my soul, hes done for, finally," said Legree, stepping
forward, to look at him. "Yes, he is! Well, his mouths shut up, at
last,thats one comfort!"
 
Yes, Legree but who shall shut up that voice in thy soul? that soul,
past repentance, past prayer, past hope, in whom the fire that never
shall be quenched is already burning!
 
Yet Tom was not quite gone. His wondrous words and pious prayers
had struck upon the hearts of the imbruted blacks, who had been the
instruments of cruelty upon him and, the instant Legree withdrew,
they took him down, and, in their ignorance, sought to call him back to
life,as if _that_ were any favor to him.
 
"Sartin, we s been doin a drefful wicked thing!" said Sambo "hopes
Masrll have to count for it, and not we."
 
They washed his wounds,they provided a rude bed, of some refuse
cotton, for him to lie down on and one of them, stealing up to the
house, begged a drink of brandy of Legree, pretending that he was tired,
and wanted it for himself. He brought it back, and poured it down Toms
throat.
 
"O, Tom!" said Quimbo, "wes been awful wicked to ye!"
 
"I forgive ye, with all my heart!" said Tom, faintly.
 
"O, Tom! do tell us who is _Jesus_, anyhow?" said Sambo"Jesus, thats
been a standin by you so, all this night!Who is he?"
 
The word roused the failing, fainting spirit. He poured forth a few
energetic sentences of that wondrous One,his life, his death, his
everlasting presence, and power to save.
 
They wept,both the two savage men.
 
"Why didnt I never hear this before?" said Sambo "but I do believe!I
cant help it! Lord Jesus, have mercy on us!"
 
"Poor critters!" said Tom, "Id be willing to bar all I have, if itll
only bring ye to Christ! O, Lord! give me these two more souls, I pray!"
 
That prayer was answered!
 
 
 
CHAPTER XLI
 
The Young Master
 
 
Two days after, a young man drove a light wagon up through the avenue of
China trees, and, throwing the reins hastily on the horses neck, sprang
out and inquired for the owner of the place.
 
It was George Shelby and, to show how he came to be there, we must go
back in our story.
 
The letter of Miss Ophelia to Mrs. Shelby had, by some unfortunate
accident, been detained, for a month or two, at some remote postoffice,
before it reached its destination and, of course, before it was
received, Tom was already lost to view among the distant swamps of the
Red River.
 
Mrs. Shelby read the intelligence with the deepest concern but
any immediate action upon it was an impossibility. She was then in
attendance on the sickbed of her husband, who lay delirious in the
crisis of a fever. Master George Shelby, who, in the interval, had
changed from a boy to a tall young man, was her constant and faithful
assistant, and her only reliance in superintending his fathers affairs.
Miss Ophelia had taken the precaution to send them the name of the
lawyer who did business for the St. Clares and the most that, in the
emergency, could be done, was to address a letter of inquiry to him.
The sudden death of Mr. Shelby, a few days after, brought, of course, an
absorbing pressure of other interests, for a season.
 
Mr. Shelby showed his confidence in his wifes ability, by appointing
her sole executrix upon his estates and thus immediately a large and
complicated amount of business was brought upon her hands.
 
Mrs. Shelby, with characteristic energy, applied herself to the work of
straightening the entangled web of affairs and she and George were
for some time occupied with collecting and examining accounts, selling
property and settling debts for Mrs. Shelby was determined that
everything should be brought into tangible and recognizable shape, let
the consequences to her prove what they might. In the mean time, they
received a letter from the lawyer to whom Miss Ophelia had referred
them, saying that he knew nothing of the matter that the man was sold
at a public auction, and that, beyond receiving the money, he knew
nothing of the affair.
 
Neither George nor Mrs. Shelby could be easy at this result and,
accordingly, some six months after, the latter, having business for his
mother, down the river, resolved to visit New Orleans, in person, and
push his inquiries, in hopes of discovering Toms whereabouts, and
restoring him.
 
After some months of unsuccessful search, by the merest accident, George
fell in with a man, in New Orleans, who happened to be possessed of the
desired information and with his money in his pocket, our hero took
steamboat for Red River, resolving to find out and repurchase his old
friend.
 
He was soon introduced into the house, where he found Legree in the
sittingroom.
 
Legree received the stranger with a kind of surly hospitality,
 
"I understand," said the young man, "that you bought, in New Orleans, a
boy, named Tom. He used to be on my fathers place, and I came to see if
I couldnt buy him back."
 
Legrees brow grew dark, and he broke out, passionately "Yes, I did
buy such a fellow,and a hl of a bargain I had of it, too! The most
rebellious, saucy, impudent dog! Set up my niggers to run away got off
two gals, worth eight hundred or a thousand apiece. He owned to that,
and, when I bid him tell me where they was, he up and said he knew,
but he wouldnt tell and stood to it, though I gave him the cussedest
flogging I ever gave nigger yet. I blieve hes trying to die but I
dont know as hell make it out."
 
"Where is he?" said George, impetuously. "Let me see him." The cheeks of
the young man were crimson, and his eyes flashed fire but he prudently
said nothing, as yet.
 
"Hes in dat ar shed," said a little fellow, who stood holding Georges
horse.
 
Legree kicked the boy, and swore at him but George, without saying
another word, turned and strode to the spot.
 
Tom had been lying two days since the fatal night, not suffering, for
every nerve of suffering was blunted and destroyed. He lay, for the most
part, in a quiet stupor for the laws of a powerful and wellknit frame
would not at once release the imprisoned spirit. By stealth, there had
been there, in the darkness of the night, poor desolated creatures, who
stole from their scanty hours rest, that they might repay to him some
of those ministrations of love in which he had always been so abundant.
Truly, those poor disciples had little to give,only the cup of cold
water but it was given with full hearts.
 
Tears had fallen on that honest, insensible face,tears of late
repentance in the poor, ignorant heathen, whom his dying love and
patience had awakened to repentance, and bitter prayers, breathed over
him to a latefound Saviour, of whom they scarce knew more than the
name, but whom the yearning ignorant heart of man never implores in
vain.
 
Cassy, who had glided out of her place of concealment, and, by
overhearing, learned the sacrifice that had been made for her and
Emmeline, had been there, the night before, defying the danger of
detection and, moved by the last few words which the affectionate soul
had yet strength to breathe, the long winter of despair, the ice of
years, had given way, and the dark, despairing woman had wept and
prayed.
 
When George entered the shed, he felt his head giddy and his heart sick.
 
"Is it possible,is it possible?" said he, kneeling down by him.
"Uncle Tom, my poor, poor old friend!"
 
Something in the voice penetrated to the ear of the dying. He moved his
head gently, smiled, and said,
 
     "Jesus can make a dyingbed
     Feel soft as down pillows are."
 
Tears which did honor to his manly heart fell from the young mans eyes,
as he bent over his poor friend.
 
"O, dear Uncle Tom! do wake,do speak once more! Look up! Heres Masr
George,your own little Masr George. Dont you know me?"
 
"Masr George!" said Tom, opening his eyes, and speaking in a feeble
voice "Masr George!" He looked bewildered.
 
Slowly the idea seemed to fill his soul and the vacant eye became fixed
and brightened, the whole face lighted up, the hard hands clasped, and
tears ran down the cheeks.
 
"Bless the Lord! it is,it is,its all I wanted! They havent forgot
me. It warms my soul it does my heart good! Now I shall die content!
Bless the Lord, on my soul!"
 
"You shant die! you _mustnt_ die, nor think of it! Ive come to buy
you, and take you home," said George, with impetuous vehemence.
 
"O, Masr George, yere too late. The Lords bought me, and is going to
take me home,and I long to go. Heaven is better than Kintuck."
 
"O, dont die! Itll kill me!itll break my heart to think what youve
suffered,and lying in this old shed, here! Poor, poor fellow!"
 
"Dont call me poor fellow!" said Tom, solemnly, "I _have_ been poor
fellow but thats all past and gone, now. Im right in the door,
going into glory! O, Masr George! _Heaven has come!_ Ive got the
victory!the Lord Jesus has given it to me! Glory be to His name!"
 
George was awestruck at the force, the vehemence, the power, with which
these broken sentences were uttered. He sat gazing in silence.
 
Tom grasped his hand, and continued,"Ye mustnt, now, tell Chloe, poor
soul! how ye found met would be so drefful to her. Only tell her ye
found me going into glory and that I couldnt stay for no one. And tell
her the Lords stood by me everywhere and alays, and made everything
light and easy. And oh, the poor chilen, and the babymy old
hearts been most broke for em, time and agin! Tell em all to
follow mefollow me! Give my love to Masr, and dear good Missis, and
everybody in the place! Ye dont know! Pears like I loves em all!
I loves every creature everywhar!its nothing _but_ love! O, Masr
George! what a thing t is to be a Christian!"
 
At this moment, Legree sauntered up to the door of the shed, looked in,
with a dogged air of affected carelessness, and turned away.
 
"The old Satan!" said George, in his indignation. "Its a comfort to
think the devil will pay _him_ for this, some of these days!"
 
"O, dont!oh, ye mustnt!" said Tom, grasping his hand "hes a
poor misable critter! its awful to think on t! Oh, if he only could
repent, the Lord would forgive him now but Im feared he never will!"
 
"I hope he wont!" said George "I never want to see _him_ in heaven!"
 
"Hush, Masr George!it worries me! Dont feel so! He ant done me no
real harm,only opened the gate of the kingdom for me thats all!"
 
At this moment, the sudden flush of strength which the joy of meeting
his young master had infused into the dying man gave way. A sudden
sinking fell upon him he closed his eyes and that mysterious and
sublime change passed over his face, that told the approach of other
worlds.
 
He began to draw his breath with long, deep inspirations and his broad
chest rose and fell, heavily. The expression of his face was that of a
conqueror.
 
"Who,who,who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" he said, in
a voice that contended with mortal weakness and, with a smile, he fell
asleep.
 
George sat fixed with solemn awe. It seemed to him that the place was
holy and, as he closed the lifeless eyes, and rose up from the dead,
only one thought possessed him,that expressed by his simple old
friend,"What a thing it is to be a Christian!"
 
He turned Legree was standing, sullenly, behind him.
 
Something in that dying scene had checked the natural fierceness of
youthful passion. The presence of the man was simply loathsome to
George and he felt only an impulse to get away from him, with as few
words as possible.
 
Fixing his keen dark eyes on Legree, he simply said, pointing to the
dead, "You have got all you ever can of him. What shall I pay you for
the body? I will take it away, and bury it decently."
 
"I dont sell dead niggers," said Legree, doggedly. "You are welcome to
bury him where and when you like."
 
"Boys," said George, in an authoritative tone, to two or three negroes,
who were looking at the body, "help me lift him up, and carry him to my
wagon and get me a spade."
 
One of them ran for a spade the other two assisted George to carry the
body to the wagon.
 
George neither spoke to nor looked at Legree, who did not countermand
his orders, but stood, whistling, with an air of forced unconcern. He
sulkily followed them to where the wagon stood at the door.
 
George spread his cloak in the wagon, and had the body carefully
disposed of in it,moving the seat, so as to give it room. Then he
turned, fixed his eyes on Legree, and said, with forced composure,
 
"I have not, as yet, said to you what I think of this most atrocious
affairthis is not the time and place. But, sir, this innocent blood
shall have justice. I will proclaim this murder. I will go to the very
first magistrate, and expose you."
 
"Do!" said Legree, snapping his fingers, scornfully. "Id like to see
you doing it. Where you going to get witnesses?how you going to prove
it?Come, now!"
 
George saw, at once, the force of this defiance. There was not a white
person on the place and, in all southern courts, the testimony of
colored blood is nothing. He felt, at that moment, as if he could have
rent the heavens with his hearts indignant cry for justice but in
vain.
 
"After all, what a fuss, for a dead nigger!" said Legree.
 
The word was as a spark to a powder magazine. Prudence was never a
cardinal virtue of the Kentucky boy. George turned, and, with one
indignant blow, knocked Legree flat upon his face and, as he stood
over him, blazing with wrath and defiance, he would have formed no bad
personification of his great namesake triumphing over the dragon.
 
Some men, however, are decidedly bettered by being knocked down. If a
man lays them fairly flat in the dust, they seem immediately to
conceive a respect for him and Legree was one of this sort. As he
rose, therefore, and brushed the dust from his clothes, he eyed the
slowlyretreating wagon with some evident consideration nor did he open
his mouth till it was out of sight.
 
Beyond the boundaries of the plantation, George had noticed a dry, sandy
knoll, shaded by a few trees there they made the grave.
 
"Shall we take off the cloak, Masr?" said the negroes, when the grave
was ready.
 
"No, no,bury it with him! Its all I can give you, now, poor Tom, and
you shall have it."
 
They laid him in and the men shovelled away, silently. They banked it
up, and laid green turf over it.
 
"You may go, boys," said George, slipping a quarter into the hand of
each. They lingered about, however.
 
"If young Masr would please buy us" said one.
 
"Wed serve him so faithful!" said the other.
 
"Hard times here, Masr!" said the first. "Do, Masr, buy us, please!"
 
"I cant!I cant!" said George, with difficulty, motioning them off
"its impossible!"
 
The poor fellows looked dejected, and walked off in silence.
 
"Witness, eternal God!" said George, kneeling on the grave of his poor
friend "oh, witness, that, from this hour, I will do _what one man can_
to drive out this curse of slavery from my land!"
 
There is no monument to mark the last restingplace of our friend.
He needs none! His Lord knows where he lies, and will raise him up,
immortal, to appear with him when he shall appear in his glory.
 
Pity him not! Such a life and death is not for pity! Not in the riches
of omnipotence is the chief glory of God but in selfdenying, suffering
love! And blessed are the men whom he calls to fellowship with him,
bearing their cross after him with patience. Of such it is written,
"Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted."
 
 
 
CHAPTER XLII
 
An Authentic Ghost Story
 
 
For some remarkable reason, ghostly legends were uncommonly rife, about
this time, among the servants on Legrees place.
 
It was whisperingly asserted that footsteps, in the dead of night, had
been heard descending the garret stairs, and patrolling the house. In
vain the doors of the upper entry had been locked the ghost either
carried a duplicate key in its pocket, or availed itself of a ghosts
immemorial privilege of coming through the keyhole, and promenaded as
before, with a freedom that was alarming.
 
Authorities were somewhat divided, as to the outward form of the spirit,
owing to a custom quite prevalent among negroes,and, for aught we
know, among whites, too,of invariably shutting the eyes, and covering
up heads under blankets, petticoats, or whatever else might come in use
for a shelter, on these occasions. Of course, as everybody knows,
when the bodily eyes are thus out of the lists, the spiritual eyes
are uncommonly vivacious and perspicuous and, therefore, there were
abundance of fulllength portraits of the ghost, abundantly sworn and
testified to, which, as if often the case with portraits, agreed with
each other in no particular, except the common family peculiarity of the
ghost tribe,the wearing of a _white sheet_. The poor souls were
not versed in ancient history, and did not know that Shakspeare had
authenticated this costume, by telling how
 
     "The sheeted dead
     Did squeak and gibber in the streets of Rome."
 
 
      _Hamlet_, Act I, scene 1, lines 115116
 
And, therefore, their all hitting upon this is a striking fact in
pneumatology, which we recommend to the attention of spiritual media
generally.
 
Be it as it may, we have private reasons for knowing that a tall figure
in a white sheet did walk, at the most approved ghostly hours,
around the Legree premises,pass out the doors, glide about the
house,disappear at intervals, and, reappearing, pass up the silent
stairway, into that fatal garret and that, in the morning, the entry
doors were all found shut and locked as firm as ever.
 
Legree could not help overhearing this whispering and it was all the
more exciting to him, from the pains that were taken to conceal it from
him. He drank more brandy than usual held up his head briskly, and
swore louder than ever in the daytime but he had bad dreams, and the
visions of his head on his bed were anything but agreeable. The night
after Toms body had been carried away, he rode to the next town for a
carouse, and had a high one. Got home late and tired locked his door,
took out the key, and went to bed.
 
After all, let a man take what pains he may to hush it down, a human
soul is an awful ghostly, unquiet possession, for a bad man to have.
Who knows the metes and bounds of it? Who knows all its awful
perhapses,those shudderings and tremblings, which it can no more live
down than it can outlive its own eternity! What a fool is he who locks
his door to keep out spirits, who has in his own bosom a spirit he dares
not meet alone,whose voice, smothered far down, and piled over with
mountains of earthliness, is yet like the forewarning trumpet of doom!
 
But Legree locked his door and set a chair against it he set a
nightlamp at the head of his bed and put his pistols there. He
examined the catches and fastenings of the windows, and then swore he
"didnt care for the devil and all his angels," and went to sleep.
 
Well, he slept, for he was tired,slept soundly. But, finally, there
came over his sleep a shadow, a horror, an apprehension of something
dreadful hanging over him. It was his mothers shroud, he thought but
Cassy had it, holding it up, and showing it to him. He heard a confused
noise of screams and groanings and, with it all, he knew he was
asleep, and he struggled to wake himself. He was half awake. He was sure
something was coming into his room. He knew the door was opening, but he
could not stir hand or foot. At last he turned, with a start the door
_was_ open, and he saw a hand putting out his light.
 
It was a cloudy, misty moonlight, and there he saw it!something white,
gliding in! He heard the still rustle of its ghostly garments. It stood
still by his beda cold hand touched his a voice said, three times,
in a low, fearful whisper, "Come! come! come!" And, while he lay
sweating with terror, he knew not when or how, the thing was gone. He
sprang out of bed, and pulled at the door. It was shut and locked, and
the man fell down in a swoon.
 
After this, Legree became a harder drinker than ever before. He no
longer drank cautiously, prudently, but imprudently and recklessly.
 
There were reports around the country, soon after that he was sick and
dying. Excess had brought on that frightful disease that seems to throw
the lurid shadows of a coming retribution back into the present life.
None could bear the horrors of that sick room, when he raved and
screamed, and spoke of sights which almost stopped the blood of those
who heard him and, at his dying bed, stood a stern, white, inexorable
figure, saying, "Come! come! come!"
 
By a singular coincidence, on the very night that this vision appeared
to Legree, the housedoor was found open in the morning, and some of the
negroes had seen two white figures gliding down the avenue towards the
highroad.
 
It was near sunrise when Cassy and Emmeline paused, for a moment, in a
little knot of trees near the town.
 
Cassy was dressed after the manner of the Creole Spanish ladies,wholly
in black. A small black bonnet on her head, covered by a veil thick
with embroidery, concealed her face. It had been agreed that, in
their escape, she was to personate the character of a Creole lady, and
Emmeline that of her servant.
 
Brought up, from early life, in connection with the highest society, the
language, movements and air of Cassy, were all in agreement with this
idea and she had still enough remaining with her, of a once splendid
wardrobe, and sets of jewels, to enable her to personate the thing to
advantage.
 
She stopped in the outskirts of the town, where she had noticed trunks
for sale, and purchased a handsome one. This she requested the man to
send along with her. And, accordingly, thus escorted by a boy wheeling
her trunk, and Emmeline behind her, carrying her carpetbag and sundry
bundles, she made her appearance at the small tavern, like a lady of
consideration.
 
The first person that struck her, after her arrival, was George Shelby,
who was staying there, awaiting the next boat.
 
Cassy had remarked the young man from her loophole in the garret, and
seen him bear away the body of Tom, and observed with secret exultation,
his rencontre with Legree. Subsequently she had gathered, from the
conversations she had overheard among the negroes, as she glided about
in her ghostly disguise, after nightfall, who he was, and in what
relation he stood to Tom. She, therefore, felt an immediate accession of
confidence, when she found that he was, like herself, awaiting the next
boat.
 
Cassys air and manner, address, and evident command of money, prevented
any rising disposition to suspicion in the hotel. People never inquire
too closely into those who are fair on the main point, of paying
well,a thing which Cassy had foreseen when she provided herself with
money.
 
In the edge of the evening, a boat was heard coming along, and George
Shelby handed Cassy aboard, with the politeness which comes naturally
to every Kentuckian, and exerted himself to provide her with a good
stateroom.
 
Cassy kept her room and bed, on pretext of illness, during the whole
time they were on Red River and was waited on, with obsequious
devotion, by her attendant.
 
When they arrived at the Mississippi river, George, having learned that
the course of the strange lady was upward, like his own, proposed to
take a stateroom for her on the same boat with himself,goodnaturedly
compassionating her feeble health, and desirous to do what he could to
assist her.
 
Behold, therefore, the whole party safely transferred to the good
steamer Cincinnati, and sweeping up the river under a powerful head of
steam.
 
Cassys health was much better. She sat upon the guards, came to the
table, and was remarked upon in the boat as a lady that must have been
very handsome.
 
From the moment that George got the first glimpse of her face, he was
troubled with one of those fleeting and indefinite likenesses, which
almost every body can remember, and has been, at times, perplexed
with. He could not keep himself from looking at her, and watching her
perpetually. At table, or sitting at her stateroom door, still
she would encounter the young mans eyes fixed on her, and politely
withdrawn, when she showed, by her countenance, that she was sensible to
the observation.
 
Cassy became uneasy. She began to think that he suspected something
and finally resolved to throw herself entirely on his generosity, and
intrusted him with her whole history.
 
George was heartily disposed to sympathize with any one who had escaped
from Legrees plantation,a place that he could not remember or speak
of with patience,and, with the courageous disregard of consequences
which is characteristic of his age and state, he assured her that he
would do all in his power to protect and bring them through.
 
The next stateroom to Cassys was occupied by a French lady, named De
Thoux, who was accompanied by a fine little daughter, a child of some
twelve summers.
 
This lady, having gathered, from Georges conversation, that he was from
Kentucky, seemed evidently disposed to cultivate his acquaintance in
which design she was seconded by the graces of her little girl, who
was about as pretty a plaything as ever diverted the weariness of a
fortnights trip on a steamboat.
 
Georges chair was often placed at her stateroom door and Cassy, as
she sat upon the guards, could hear their conversation.
 
Madame de Thoux was very minute in her inquiries as to Kentucky,
where she said she had resided in a former period of her life. George
discovered, to his surprise, that her former residence must have been
in his own vicinity and her inquiries showed a knowledge of people and
things in his vicinity, that was perfectly surprising to him.
 
"Do you know," said Madame de Thoux to him, one day, "of any man, in
your neighborhood, of the name of Harris?"
 
"There is an old fellow, of that name, lives not far from my fathers
place," said George. "We never have had much intercourse with him,
though."
 
"He is a large slaveowner, I believe," said Madame de Thoux, with a
manner which seemed to betray more interest than she was exactly willing
to show.
 
"He is," said George, looking rather surprised at her manner.
 
"Did you ever know of his havingperhaps, you may have heard of his
having a mulatto boy, named George?"
 
"O, certainly,George Harris,I know him well he married a servant of
my mothers, but has escaped, now, to Canada."
 
"He has?" said Madame de Thoux, quickly. "Thank God!"
 
George looked a surprised inquiry, but said nothing.
 
Madame de Thoux leaned her head on her hand, and burst into tears.
 
"He is my brother," she said.
 
"Madame!" said George, with a strong accent of surprise.
 
"Yes," said Madame de Thoux, lifting her head, proudly, and wiping her
tears, "Mr. Shelby, George Harris is my brother!"
 
"I am perfectly astonished," said George, pushing back his chair a pace
or two, and looking at Madame de Thoux.
 
"I was sold to the South when he was a boy," said she. "I was bought by
a good and generous man. He took me with him to the West Indies, set me
free, and married me. It is but lately that he died and I was going up
to Kentucky, to see if I could find and redeem my brother."
 
"I heard him speak of a sister Emily, that was sold South," said George.
 
"Yes, indeed! I am the one," said Madame de Thoux"tell me what sort
of a"
 
"A very fine young man," said George, "notwithstanding the curse of
slavery that lay on him. He sustained a first rate character, both
for intelligence and principle. I know, you see," he said "because he
married in our family."
 
"What sort of a girl?" said Madame de Thoux, eagerly.
 
"A treasure," said George "a beautiful, intelligent, amiable girl.
Very pious. My mother had brought her up, and trained her as carefully,
almost, as a daughter. She could read and write, embroider and sew,
beautifully and was a beautiful singer."
 
"Was she born in your house?" said Madame de Thoux.
 
"No. Father bought her once, in one of his trips to New Orleans, and
brought her up as a present to mother. She was about eight or nine years
old, then. Father would never tell mother what he gave for her but, the
other day, in looking over his old papers, we came across the bill of
sale. He paid an extravagant sum for her, to be sure. I suppose, on
account of her extraordinary beauty."
 
George sat with his back to Cassy, and did not see the absorbed
expression of her countenance, as he was giving these details.
 
At this point in the story, she touched his arm, and, with a face
perfectly white with interest, said, "Do you know the names of the
people he bought her of?"
 
"A man of the name of Simmons, I think, was the principal in the
transaction. At least, I think that was the name on the bill of sale."
 
"O, my God!" said Cassy, and fell insensible on the floor of the cabin.
 
George was wide awake now, and so was Madame de Thoux. Though neither of
them could conjecture what was the cause of Cassys fainting, still they
made all the tumult which is proper in such casesGeorge upsetting a
washpitcher, and breaking two tumblers, in the warmth of his humanity
and various ladies in the cabin, hearing that somebody had fainted,
crowded the stateroom door, and kept out all the air they possibly
could, so that, on the whole, everything was done that could be
expected.
 
Poor Cassy! when she recovered, turned her face to the wall, and wept
and sobbed like a child,perhaps, mother, you can tell what she was
thinking of! Perhaps you cannot,but she felt as sure, in that hour,
that God had had mercy on her, and that she should see her daughter,as
she did, months afterwards,whenbut we anticipate.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XLIII
 
Results
 
 
The rest of our story is soon told. George Shelby, interested, as any
other young man might be, by the romance of the incident, no less than
by feelings of humanity, was at the pains to send to Cassy the bill
of sale of Eliza whose date and name all corresponded with her own
knowledge of facts, and felt no doubt upon her mind as to the identity
of her child. It remained now only for her to trace out the path of the
fugitives.
 
Madame de Thoux and she, thus drawn together by the singular coincidence
of their fortunes, proceeded immediately to Canada, and began a tour of
inquiry among the stations, where the numerous fugitives from slavery
are located. At Amherstberg they found the missionary with whom George
and Eliza had taken shelter, on their first arrival in Canada and
through him were enabled to trace the family to Montreal.
 
George and Eliza had now been five years free. George had found constant
occupation in the shop of a worthy machinist, where he had been earning
a competent support for his family, which, in the mean time, had been
increased by the addition of another daughter.
 
Little Harrya fine bright boyhad been put to a good school, and was
making rapid proficiency in knowledge.
 
The worthy pastor of the station, in Amherstberg, where George had first
landed, was so much interested in the statements of Madame de Thoux and
Cassy, that he yielded to the solicitations of the former, to accompany
them to Montreal, in their search,she bearing all the expense of the
expedition.
 
The scene now changes to a small, neat tenement, in the outskirts of
Montreal the time, evening. A cheerful fire blazes on the hearth a
teatable, covered with a snowy cloth, stands prepared for the evening
meal. In one corner of the room was a table covered with a green cloth,
where was an open writingdesk, pens, paper, and over it a shelf of
wellselected books.
 
This was Georges study. The same zeal for selfimprovement, which led
him to steal the much coveted arts of reading and writing, amid all the
toil and discouragements of his early life, still led him to devote all
his leisure time to selfcultivation.
 
At this present time, he is seated at the table, making notes from a
volume of the family library he has been reading.
 
"Come, George," says Eliza, "youve been gone all day. Do put down that
book, and lets talk, while Im getting tea,do."
 
And little Eliza seconds the effort, by toddling up to her father, and
trying to pull the book out of his hand, and install herself on his knee
as a substitute.
 
"O, you little witch!" says George, yielding, as, in such circumstances,
man always must.
 
"Thats right," says Eliza, as she begins to cut a loaf of bread. A
little older she looks her form a little fuller her air more matronly
than of yore but evidently contented and happy as woman need be.
 
"Harry, my boy, how did you come on in that sum, today?" says George, as
he laid his hand on his sons head.
 
Harry has lost his long curls but he can never lose those eyes and
eyelashes, and that fine, bold brow, that flushes with triumph, as he
answers, "I did it, every bit of it, _myself_, father and _nobody_
helped me!"
 
"Thats right," says his father "depend on yourself, my son. You have a
better chance than ever your poor father had."
 
At this moment, there is a rap at the door and Eliza goes and opens
it. The delighted"Why! this you?"calls up her husband and the good
pastor of Amherstberg is welcomed. There are two more women with him,
and Eliza asks them to sit down.
 
Now, if the truth must be told, the honest pastor had arranged a little
programme, according to which this affair was to develop itself and,
on the way up, all had very cautiously and prudently exhorted each other
not to let things out, except according to previous arrangement.
 
What was the good mans consternation, therefore, just as he
had motioned to the ladies to be seated, and was taking out his
pockethandkerchief to wipe his mouth, so as to proceed to his
introductory speech in good order, when Madame de Thoux upset the whole
plan, by throwing her arms around Georges neck, and letting all out at
once, by saying, "O, George! dont you know me? Im your sister Emily."
 
Cassy had seated herself more composedly, and would have carried on her
part very well, had not little Eliza suddenly appeared before her in
exact shape and form, every outline and curl, just as her daughter was
when she saw her last. The little thing peered up in her face and Cassy
caught her up in her arms, pressed her to her bosom, saying, what, at
the moment she really believed, "Darling, Im your mother!"
 
In fact, it was a troublesome matter to do up exactly in proper order
but the good pastor, at last, succeeded in getting everybody quiet, and
delivering the speech with which he had intended to open the exercises
and in which, at last, he succeeded so well, that his whole audience
were sobbing about him in a manner that ought to satisfy any orator,
ancient or modern.
 
They knelt together, and the good man prayed,for there are some
feelings so agitated and tumultuous, that they can find rest only by
being poured into the bosom of Almighty love,and then, rising up, the
newfound family embraced each other, with a holy trust in Him, who
from such peril and dangers, and by such unknown ways, had brought them
together.
 
The notebook of a missionary, among the Canadian fugitives, contains
truth stranger than fiction. How can it be otherwise, when a system
prevails which whirls families and scatters their members, as the wind
whirls and scatters the leaves of autumn? These shores of refuge, like
the eternal shore, often unite again, in glad communion, hearts that
for long years have mourned each other as lost. And affecting beyond
expression is the earnestness with which every new arrival among them
is met, if, perchance, it may bring tidings of mother, sister, child or
wife, still lost to view in the shadows of slavery.
 
Deeds of heroism are wrought here more than those of romance, when
defying torture, and braving death itself, the fugitive voluntarily
threads his way back to the terrors and perils of that dark land, that
he may bring out his sister, or mother, or wife.
 
One young man, of whom a missionary has told us, twice recaptured, and
suffering shameful stripes for his heroism, had escaped again and, in
a letter which we heard read, tells his friends that he is going back a
third time, that he may, at last, bring away his sister. My good sir,
is this man a hero, or a criminal? Would not you do as much for your
sister? And can you blame him?
 
But, to return to our friends, whom we left wiping their eyes, and
recovering themselves from too great and sudden a joy. They are now
seated around the social board, and are getting decidedly companionable
only that Cassy, who keeps little Eliza on her lap, occasionally
squeezes the little thing, in a manner that rather astonishes her, and
obstinately refuses to have her mouth stuffed with cake to the extent
the little one desires,alleging, what the child rather wonders at,
that she has got something better than cake, and doesnt want it.
 
And, indeed, in two or three days, such a change has passed over Cassy,
that our readers would scarcely know her. The despairing, haggard
expression of her face had given way to one of gentle trust. She seemed
to sink, at once, into the bosom of the family, and take the little ones
into her heart, as something for which it long had waited. Indeed, her
love seemed to flow more naturally to the little Eliza than to her own
daughter for she was the exact image and body of the child whom she
had lost. The little one was a flowery bond between mother and daughter,
through whom grew up acquaintanceship and affection. Elizas steady,
consistent piety, regulated by the constant reading of the sacred
word, made her a proper guide for the shattered and wearied mind of her
mother. Cassy yielded at once, and with her whole soul, to every good
influence, and became a devout and tender Christian.
 
After a day or two, Madame de Thoux told her brother more particularly
of her affairs. The death of her husband had left her an ample fortune,
which she generously offered to share with the family. When she asked
George what way she could best apply it for him, he answered, "Give me
an education, Emily that has always been my hearts desire. Then, I can
do all the rest."
 
On mature deliberation, it was decided that the whole family should go,
for some years, to France whither they sailed, carrying Emmeline with
them.
 
The good looks of the latter won the affection of the first mate of the
vessel and, shortly after entering the port, she became his wife.
 
George remained four years at a French university, and, applying himself
with an unintermitted zeal, obtained a very thorough education.
 
Political troubles in France, at last, led the family again to seek an
asylum in this country.
 
Georges feelings and views, as an educated man, may be best expressed
in a letter to one of his friends.
 
"I feel somewhat at a loss, as to my future course. True, as you
have said to me, I might mingle in the circles of the whites, in this
country, my shade of color is so slight, and that of my wife and family
scarce perceptible. Well, perhaps, on sufferance, I might. But, to tell
you the truth, I have no wish to.
 
"My sympathies are not for my fathers race, but for my mothers. To him
I was no more than a fine dog or horse to my poor heartbroken mother
I was a _child_ and, though I never saw her, after the cruel sale that
separated us, till she died, yet I _know_ she always loved me dearly.
I know it by my own heart. When I think of all she suffered, of my own
early sufferings, of the distresses and struggles of my heroic wife, of
my sister, sold in the New Orleans slavemarket,though I hope to have
no unchristian sentiments, yet I may be excused for saying, I have no
wish to pass for an American, or to identify myself with them.
 
"It is with the oppressed, enslaved African race that I cast in my lot
and, if I wished anything, I would wish myself two shades darker, rather
than one lighter.
 
"The desire and yearning of my soul is for an African _nationality_. I
want a people that shall have a tangible, separate existence of its
own and where am I to look for it? Not in Hayti for in Hayti they had
nothing to start with. A stream cannot rise above its fountain. The race
that formed the character of the Haytiens was a wornout, effeminate
one and, of course, the subject race will be centuries in rising to
anything.
 
"Where, then, shall I look? On the shores of Africa I see a republic,a
republic formed of picked men, who, by energy and selfeducating force,
have, in many cases, individually, raised themselves above a condition
of slavery. Having gone through a preparatory stage of feebleness, this
republic has, at last, become an acknowledged nation on the face of the
earth,acknowledged by both France and England. There it is my wish to
go, and find myself a people.
 
"I am aware, now, that I shall have you all against me but, before
you strike, hear me. During my stay in France, I have followed up, with
intense interest, the history of my people in America. I have noted the
struggle between abolitionist and colonizationist, and have received
some impressions, as a distant spectator, which could never have
occurred to me as a participator.
 
"I grant that this Liberia may have subserved all sorts of purposes, by
being played off, in the hands of our oppressors, against us. Doubtless
the scheme may have been used, in unjustifiable ways, as a means of
retarding our emancipation. But the question to me is, Is there not a
God above all mans schemes? May He not have overruled their designs,
and founded for us a nation by them?
 
"In these days, a nation is born in a day. A nation starts, now, with
all the great problems of republican life and civilization wrought out
to its handit has not to discover, but only to apply. Let us, then,
all take hold together, with all our might, and see what we can do with
this new enterprise, and the whole splendid continent of Africa
opens before us and our children. _Our nation_ shall roll the tide of
civilization and Christianity along its shores, and plant there mighty
republics, that, growing with the rapidity of tropical vegetation, shall
be for all coming ages.
 
"Do you say that I am deserting my enslaved brethren? I think not. If I
forget them one hour, one moment of my life, so may God forget me! But,
what can I do for them, here? Can I break their chains? No, not as an
individual but, let me go and form part of a nation, which shall have a
voice in the councils of nations, and then we can speak. A nation has
a right to argue, remonstrate, implore, and present the cause of its
race,which an individual has not.
 
"If Europe ever becomes a grand council of free nations,as I trust in
God it will,if, there, serfdom, and all unjust and oppressive social
inequalities, are done away and if they, as France and England have
done, acknowledge our position,then, in the great congress of nations,
we will make our appeal, and present the cause of our enslaved and
suffering race and it cannot be that free, enlightened America will
not then desire to wipe from her escutcheon that bar sinister which
disgraces her among nations, and is as truly a curse to her as to the
enslaved.
 
"But, you will tell me, our race have equal rights to mingle in the
American republic as the Irishman, the German, the Swede. Granted,
they have. We _ought_ to be free to meet and mingle,to rise by our
individual worth, without any consideration of caste or color and they
who deny us this right are false to their own professed principles of
human equality. We ought, in particular, to be allowed _here_. We have
_more_ than the rights of common menwe have the claim of an injured
race for reparation. But, then, _I do not want it_ I want a country, a
nation, of my own. I think that the African race has peculiarities, yet
to be unfolded in the light of civilization and Christianity, which, if
not the same with those of the AngloSaxon, may prove to be, morally, of
even a higher type.
 
"To the AngloSaxon race has been intrusted the destinies of the world,
during its pioneer period of struggle and conflict. To that mission
its stern, inflexible, energetic elements, were well adapted but, as
a Christian, I look for another era to arise. On its borders I trust we
stand and the throes that now convulse the nations are, to my hope, but
the birthpangs of an hour of universal peace and brotherhood.
 
"I trust that the development of Africa is to be essentially a Christian
one. If not a dominant and commanding race, they are, at least, an
affectionate, magnanimous, and forgiving one. Having been called in the
furnace of injustice and oppression, they have need to bind closer to
their hearts that sublime doctrine of love and forgiveness, through
which alone they are to conquer, which it is to be their mission to
spread over the continent of Africa.
 
"In myself, I confess, I am feeble for this,full half the blood in my
veins is the hot and hasty Saxon but I have an eloquent preacher of
the Gospel ever by my side, in the person of my beautiful wife. When I
wander, her gentler spirit ever restores me, and keeps before my eyes
the Christian calling and mission of our race. As a Christian patriot,
as a teacher of Christianity, I go to _my country_,my chosen, my
glorious Africa!and to her, in my heart, I sometimes apply those
splendid words of prophecy Whereas thou hast been forsaken and
hated, so that no man went through thee _I_ will make thee an eternal
excellence, a joy of many generations!
 
"You will call me an enthusiast you will tell me that I have not well
considered what I am undertaking. But I have considered, and counted
the cost. I go to _Liberia_, not as an Elysium of romance, but as to _a
field of work_. I expect to work with both hands,to work _hard_ to
work against all sorts of difficulties and discouragements and to work
till I die. This is what I go for and in this I am quite sure I shall
not be disappointed.
 
"Whatever you may think of my determination, do not divorce me from your
confidence and think that, in whatever I do, I act with a heart wholly
given to my people.
 
"GEORGE HARRIS."
 
 
George, with his wife, children, sister and mother, embarked for Africa,
some few weeks after. If we are not mistaken, the world will yet hear
from him there.
 
Of our other characters we have nothing very particular to write, except
a word relating to Miss Ophelia and Topsy, and a farewell chapter, which
we shall dedicate to George Shelby.
 
Miss Ophelia took Topsy home to Vermont with her, much to the surprise
of the grave deliberative body whom a New Englander recognizes under
the term "_Our folks_." "Our folks," at first, thought it an odd and
unnecessary addition to their welltrained domestic establishment but,
so thoroughly efficient was Miss Ophelia in her conscientious endeavor
to do her duty by her _eleve_, that the child rapidly grew in grace and
in favor with the family and neighborhood. At the age of womanhood, she
was, by her own request, baptized, and became a member of the Christian
church in the place and showed so much intelligence, activity and zeal,
and desire to do good in the world, that she was at last recommended,
and approved as a missionary to one of the stations in Africa and we
have heard that the same activity and ingenuity which, when a child,
made her so multiform and restless in her developments, is now employed,
in a safer and wholesomer manner, in teaching the children of her own
country.
 
P.S.It will be a satisfaction to some mother, also, to state, that
some inquiries, which were set on foot by Madame de Thoux, have resulted
recently in the discovery of Cassys son. Being a young man of energy,
he had escaped, some years before his mother, and been received and
educated by friends of the oppressed in the north. He will soon follow
his family to Africa.
 
 
 
CHAPTER XLIV
 
The Liberator
 
 
George Shelby had written to his mother merely a line, stating the day
that she might expect him home. Of the death scene of his old friend
he had not the heart to write. He had tried several times, and only
succeeded in half choking himself and invariably finished by tearing up
the paper, wiping his eyes, and rushing somewhere to get quiet.
 
There was a pleased bustle all though the Shelby mansion, that day, in
expectation of the arrival of young Masr George.
 
Mrs. Shelby was seated in her comfortable parlor, where a cheerful
hickory fire was dispelling the chill of the late autumn evening. A
suppertable, glittering with plate and cut glass, was set out, on whose
arrangements our former friend, old Chloe, was presiding.
 
Arrayed in a new calico dress, with clean, white apron, and high,
wellstarched turban, her black polished face glowing with satisfaction,
she lingered, with needless punctiliousness, around the arrangements of
the table, merely as an excuse for talking a little to her mistress.
 
"Laws, now! wont it look natural to him?" she said. "Thar,I set his
plate just whar he likes it round by the fire. Masr George allers
wants de warm seat. O, go way!why didnt Sally get out de _best_
teapot,de little new one, Masr George got for Missis, Christmas?
Ill have it out! And Missis has heard from Masr George?" she said,
inquiringly.
 
"Yes, Chloe but only a line, just to say he would be home tonight, if
he could,thats all."
 
"Didnt say nothin bout my old man, spose?" said Chloe, still
fidgeting with the teacups.
 
"No, he didnt. He did not speak of anything, Chloe. He said he would
tell all, when he got home."
 
"Jes like Masr George,hes allers so ferce for tellin everything
hisself. I allers minded dat ar in Masr George. Dont see, for my part,
how white people genlly can bar to hev to write things much as they do,
writin s such slow, oneasy kind o work."
 
Mrs. Shelby smiled.
 
"Im a thinkin my old man wont know de boys and de baby. Lor! shes
de biggest gal, now,good she is, too, and peart, Polly is. Shes out
to the house, now, watchin de hoecake. I s got jist de very pattern
my old man liked so much, a bakin. Jist sich as I gin him the mornin
he was took off. Lord bless us! how I felt, dat ar morning!"
 
Mrs. Shelby sighed, and felt a heavy weight on her heart, at this
allusion. She had felt uneasy, ever since she received her sons letter,
lest something should prove to be hidden behind the veil of silence
which he had drawn.
 
"Missis has got dem bills?" said Chloe, anxiously.
 
"Yes, Chloe."
 
"Cause I wants to show my old man dem very bills de _perfectioner_
gave me. And, say he, Chloe, I wish youd stay longer. Thank
you, Masr, says I, I would, only my old mans coming home, and
Missis,she cant do without me no longer. Theres jist what I telled
him. Berry nice man, dat Masr Jones was."
 
Chloe had pertinaciously insisted that the very bills in which her wages
had been paid should be preserved, to show her husband, in memorial of
her capability. And Mrs. Shelby had readily consented to humor her in
the request.
 
"He wont know Polly,my old man wont. Laws, its five year since they
tuck him! She was a baby den,couldnt but jist stand. Remember how
tickled he used to be, cause she would keep a fallin over, when she sot
out to walk. Laws a me!"
 
The rattling of wheels now was heard.
 
"Masr George!" said Aunt Chloe, starting to the window.
 
Mrs. Shelby ran to the entry door, and was folded in the arms of
her son. Aunt Chloe stood anxiously straining her eyes out into the
darkness.
 
"O, _poor_ Aunt Chloe!" said George, stopping compassionately, and
taking her hard, black hand between both his "Id have given all my
fortune to have brought him with me, but hes gone to a better country."
 
There was a passionate exclamation from Mrs. Shelby, but Aunt Chloe said
nothing.
 
The party entered the supperroom. The money, of which Chloe was so
proud, was still lying on the table.
 
"Thar," said she, gathering it up, and holding it, with a trembling
hand, to her mistress, "dont never want to see nor hear on t
again. Jist as I knew t would be,sold, and murdered on dem ar old
plantations!"
 
Chloe turned, and was walking proudly out of the room. Mrs. Shelby
followed her softly, and took one of her hands, drew her down into a
chair, and sat down by her.
 
"My poor, good Chloe!" said she.
 
Chloe leaned her head on her mistress shoulder, and sobbed out, "O
Missis! scuse me, my hearts broke,dats all!"
 
"I know it is," said Mrs. Shelby, as her tears fell fast "and _I_
cannot heal it, but Jesus can. He healeth the broken hearted, and
bindeth up their wounds."
 
There was a silence for some time, and all wept together. At last,
George, sitting down beside the mourner, took her hand, and, with simple
pathos, repeated the triumphant scene of her husbands death, and his
last messages of love.
 
About a month after this, one morning, all the servants of the Shelby
estate were convened together in the great hall that ran through the
house, to hear a few words from their young master.
 
To the surprise of all, he appeared among them with a bundle of papers
in his hand, containing a certificate of freedom to every one on the
place, which he read successively, and presented, amid the sobs and
tears and shouts of all present.
 
Many, however, pressed around him, earnestly begging him not to send
them away and, with anxious faces, tendering back their free papers.
 
"We dont want to be no freer than we are. Wes allers had all we
wanted. We dont want to leave de ole place, and Masr and Missis, and
de rest!"
 
"My good friends," said George, as soon as he could get a silence,
"therell be no need for you to leave me. The place wants as many hands
to work it as it did before. We need the same about the house that we
did before. But, you are now free men and free women. I shall pay you
wages for your work, such as we shall agree on. The advantage is, that
in case of my getting in debt, or dying,things that might happen,you
cannot now be taken up and sold. I expect to carry on the estate, and
to teach you what, perhaps, it will take you some time to learn,how
to use the rights I give you as free men and women. I expect you to be
good, and willing to learn and I trust in God that I shall be faithful,
and willing to teach. And now, my friends, look up, and thank God for
the blessing of freedom."
 
An aged, partriarchal negro, who had grown gray and blind on the estate,
now rose, and, lifting his trembling hand said, "Let us give thanks unto
the Lord!" As all kneeled by one consent, a more touching and hearty _Te
Deum_ never ascended to heaven, though borne on the peal of organ, bell
and cannon, than came from that honest old heart.
 
On rising, another struck up a Methodist hymn, of which the burden was,
 
     "The year of Jubilee is come,
     Return, ye ransomed sinners, home."
 
"One thing more," said George, as he stopped the congratulations of the
throng "you all remember our good old Uncle Tom?"
 
George here gave a short narration of the scene of his death, and of his
loving farewell to all on the place, and added,
 
"It was on his grave, my friends, that I resolved, before God, that I
would never own another slave, while it was possible to free him that
nobody, through me, should ever run the risk of being parted from home
and friends, and dying on a lonely plantation, as he died. So, when you
rejoice in your freedom, think that you owe it to that good old soul,
and pay it back in kindness to his wife and children. Think of your
freedom, every time you see UNCLE TOMS CABIN and let it be a memorial
to put you all in mind to follow in his steps, and be honest and
faithful and Christian as he was."
 
 
 
CHAPTER XLV
 
Concluding Remarks
 
 
The writer has often been inquired of, by correspondents from different
parts of the country, whether this narrative is a true one and to these
inquiries she will give one general answer.
 
The separate incidents that compose the narrative are, to a very
great extent, authentic, occurring, many of them, either under her own
observation, or that of her personal friends. She or her friends
have observed characters the counterpart of almost all that are here
introduced and many of the sayings are word for word as heard herself,
or reported to her.
 
The personal appearance of Eliza, the character ascribed to her, are
sketches drawn from life. The incorruptible fidelity, piety and honesty,
of Uncle Tom, had more than one development, to her personal knowledge.
Some of the most deeply tragic and romantic, some of the most terrible
incidents, have also their parallels in reality. The incident of the
mothers crossing the Ohio river on the ice is a wellknown fact. The
story of "old Prue," in the second volume, was an incident that
fell under the personal observation of a brother of the writer, then
collectingclerk to a large mercantile house, in New Orleans. From the
same source was derived the character of the planter Legree. Of him her
brother thus wrote, speaking of visiting his plantation, on a
collecting tour "He actually made me feel of his fist, which was like
a blacksmiths hammer, or a nodule of iron, telling me that it was
calloused with knocking down niggers. When I left the plantation, I
drew a long breath, and felt as if I had escaped from an ogres den."
 
That the tragical fate of Tom, also, has too many times had its
parallel, there are living witnesses, all over our land, to testify.
Let it be remembered that in all southern states it is a principle of
jurisprudence that no person of colored lineage can testify in a suit
against a white, and it will be easy to see that such a case may occur,
wherever there is a man whose passions outweigh his interests, and a
slave who has manhood or principle enough to resist his will. There is,
actually, nothing to protect the slaves life, but the _character_ of
the master. Facts too shocking to be contemplated occasionally force
their way to the public ear, and the comment that one often hears made
on them is more shocking than the thing itself. It is said, "Very likely
such cases may now and then occur, but they are no sample of general
practice." If the laws of New England were so arranged that a master
could _now and then_ torture an apprentice to death, would it be
received with equal composure? Would it be said, "These cases are rare,
and no samples of general practice"? This injustice is an _inherent_ one
in the slave system,it cannot exist without it.
 
The public and shameless sale of beautiful mulatto and quadroon girls
has acquired a notoriety, from the incidents following the capture of
the Pearl. We extract the following from the speech of Hon. Horace Mann,
one of the legal counsel for the defendants in that case. He says "In
that company of seventysix persons, who attempted, in 1848, to escape
from the District of Columbia in the schooner Pearl, and whose officers
I assisted in defending, there were several young and healthy girls, who
had those peculiar attractions of form and feature which connoisseurs
prize so highly. Elizabeth Russel was one of them. She immediately
fell into the slavetraders fangs, and was doomed for the New Orleans
market. The hearts of those that saw her were touched with pity for
her fate. They offered eighteen hundred dollars to redeem her and some
there were who offered to give, that would not have much left after the
gift but the fiend of a slavetrader was inexorable. She was despatched
to New Orleans but, when about half way there, God had mercy on her,
and smote her with death. There were two girls named Edmundson in the
same company. When about to be sent to the same market, an older sister
went to the shambles, to plead with the wretch who owned them, for the
love of God, to spare his victims. He bantered her, telling what fine
dresses and fine furniture they would have. Yes, she said, that may
do very well in this life, but what will become of them in the next?
They too were sent to New Orleans but were afterwards redeemed, at an
enormous ransom, and brought back." Is it not plain, from this, that the
histories of Emmeline and Cassy may have many counterparts?
 
Justice, too, obliges the author to state that the fairness of mind and
generosity attributed to St. Clare are not without a parallel, as
the following anecdote will show. A few years since, a young southern
gentleman was in Cincinnati, with a favorite servant, who had been his
personal attendant from a boy. The young man took advantage of this
opportunity to secure his own freedom, and fled to the protection of
a Quaker, who was quite noted in affairs of this kind. The owner
was exceedingly indignant. He had always treated the slave with such
indulgence, and his confidence in his affection was such, that he
believed he must have been practised upon to induce him to revolt from
him. He visited the Quaker, in high anger but, being possessed of
uncommon candor and fairness, was soon quieted by his arguments and
representations. It was a side of the subject which he never had
heard,never had thought on and he immediately told the Quaker that,
if his slave would, to his own face, say that it was his desire to be
free, he would liberate him. An interview was forthwith procured, and
Nathan was asked by his young master whether he had ever had any reason
to complain of his treatment, in any respect.
 
"No, Masr," said Nathan "youve always been good to me."
 
"Well, then, why do you want to leave me?"
 
"Masr may die, and then who get me?Id rather be a free man."
 
After some deliberation, the young master replied, "Nathan, in your
place, I think I should feel very much so, myself. You are free."
 
He immediately made him out free papers deposited a sum of money in the
hands of the Quaker, to be judiciously used in assisting him to start
in life, and left a very sensible and kind letter of advice to the young
man. That letter was for some time in the writers hands.
 
The author hopes she has done justice to that nobility, generosity, and
humanity, which in many cases characterize individuals at the South.
Such instances save us from utter despair of our kind. But, she asks any
person, who knows the world, are such characters _common_, anywhere?
 
For many years of her life, the author avoided all reading upon or
allusion to the subject of slavery, considering it as too painful to
be inquired into, and one which advancing light and civilization would
certainly live down. But, since the legislative act of 1850, when she
heard, with perfect surprise and consternation, Christian and humane
people actually recommending the remanding escaped fugitives into
slavery, as a duty binding on good citizens,when she heard, on all
hands, from kind, compassionate and estimable people, in the free states
of the North, deliberations and discussions as to what Christian duty
could be on this head,she could only think, These men and Christians
cannot know what slavery is if they did, such a question could never
be open for discussion. And from this arose a desire to exhibit it in a
_living dramatic reality_. She has endeavored to show it fairly, in its
best and its worst phases. In its _best_ aspect, she has, perhaps,
been successful but, oh! who shall say what yet remains untold in that
valley and shadow of death, that lies the other side?
 
To you, generous, nobleminded men and women, of the South,you, whose
virtue, and magnanimity and purity of character, are the greater for the
severer trial it has encountered,to you is her appeal. Have you not,
in your own secret souls, in your own private conversings, felt that
there are woes and evils, in this accursed system, far beyond what are
here shadowed, or can be shadowed? Can it be otherwise? Is _man_ ever a
creature to be trusted with wholly irresponsible power? And does not the
slave system, by denying the slave all legal right of testimony, make
every individual owner an irresponsible despot? Can anybody fail to
make the inference what the practical result will be? If there is, as we
admit, a public sentiment among you, men of honor, justice and humanity,
is there not also another kind of public sentiment among the ruffian,
the brutal and debased? And cannot the ruffian, the brutal, the debased,
by slave law, own just as many slaves as the best and purest? Are the
honorable, the just, the highminded and compassionate, the majority
anywhere in this world?
 
The slavetrade is now, by American law, considered as piracy. But
a slavetrade, as systematic as ever was carried on on the coast of
Africa, is an inevitable attendant and result of American slavery. And
its heartbreak and its horrors, can they be told?
 
The writer has given only a faint shadow, a dim picture, of the anguish
and despair that are, at this very moment, riving thousands of hearts,
shattering thousands of families, and driving a helpless and sensitive
race to frenzy and despair. There are those living who know the mothers
whom this accursed traffic has driven to the murder of their children
and themselves seeking in death a shelter from woes more dreaded
than death. Nothing of tragedy can be written, can be spoken, can be
conceived, that equals the frightful reality of scenes daily and hourly
acting on our shores, beneath the shadow of American law, and the shadow
of the cross of Christ.
 
And now, men and women of America, is this a thing to be trifled with,
apologized for, and passed over in silence? Farmers of Massachusetts,
of New Hampshire, of Vermont, of Connecticut, who read this book by the
blaze of your winterevening fire,stronghearted, generous sailors
and shipowners of Maine,is this a thing for you to countenance and
encourage? Brave and generous men of New York, farmers of rich and
joyous Ohio, and ye of the wide prairie states,answer, is this a thing
for you to protect and countenance? And you, mothers of America,you
who have learned, by the cradles of your own children, to love and feel
for all mankind,by the sacred love you bear your child by your joy
in his beautiful, spotless infancy by the motherly pity and tenderness
with which you guide his growing years by the anxieties of his
education by the prayers you breathe for his souls eternal goodI
beseech you, pity the mother who has all your affections, and not one
legal right to protect, guide, or educate, the child of her bosom! By
the sick hour of your child by those dying eyes, which you can never
forget by those last cries, that wrung your heart when you could
neither help nor save by the desolation of that empty cradle, that
silent nursery,I beseech you, pity those mothers that are constantly
made childless by the American slavetrade! And say, mothers of America,
is this a thing to be defended, sympathized with, passed over in
silence?
 
Do you say that the people of the free state have nothing to do with it,
and can do nothing? Would to God this were true! But it is not true. The
people of the free states have defended, encouraged, and participated
and are more guilty for it, before God, than the South, in that they
have not the apology of education or custom.
 
If the mothers of the free states had all felt as they should, in times
past, the sons of the free states would not have been the holders, and,
proverbially, the hardest masters of slaves the sons of the free states
would not have connived at the extension of slavery, in our national
body the sons of the free states would not, as they do, trade the
souls and bodies of men as an equivalent to money, in their mercantile
dealings. There are multitudes of slaves temporarily owned, and sold
again, by merchants in northern cities and shall the whole guilt or
obloquy of slavery fall only on the South?
 
Northern men, northern mothers, northern Christians, have something more
to do than denounce their brethren at the South they have to look to
the evil among themselves.
 
But, what can any individual do? Of that, every individual can judge.
There is one thing that every individual can do,they can see to it
that _they feel right_. An atmosphere of sympathetic influence encircles
every human being and the man or woman who _feels_ strongly, healthily
and justly, on the great interests of humanity, is a constant benefactor
to the human race. See, then, to your sympathies in this matter! Are
they in harmony with the sympathies of Christ? or are they swayed and
perverted by the sophistries of worldly policy?
 
Christian men and women of the North! still further,you have another
power you can _pray!_ Do you believe in prayer? or has it become an
indistinct apostolic tradition? You pray for the heathen abroad pray
also for the heathen at home. And pray for those distressed Christians
whose whole chance of religious improvement is an accident of trade and
sale from whom any adherence to the morals of Christianity is, in many
cases, an impossibility, unless they have given them, from above, the
courage and grace of martyrdom.
 
But, still more. On the shores of our free states are emerging the poor,
shattered, broken remnants of families,men and women, escaped, by
miraculous providences from the surges of slavery,feeble in knowledge,
and, in many cases, infirm in moral constitution, from a system which
confounds and confuses every principle of Christianity and morality.
They come to seek a refuge among you they come to seek education,
knowledge, Christianity.
 
What do you owe to these poor unfortunates, oh Christians? Does
not every American Christian owe to the African race some effort at
reparation for the wrongs that the American nation has brought upon
them? Shall the doors of churches and schoolhouses be shut upon them?
Shall states arise and shake them out? Shall the church of Christ hear
in silence the taunt that is thrown at them, and shrink away from the
helpless hand that they stretch out and, by her silence, encourage the
cruelty that would chase them from our borders? If it must be so, it
will be a mournful spectacle. If it must be so, the country will have
reason to tremble, when it remembers that the fate of nations is in the
hands of One who is very pitiful, and of tender compassion.
 
Do you say, "We dont want them here let them go to Africa"?
 
That the providence of God has provided a refuge in Africa, is, indeed,
a great and noticeable fact but that is no reason why the church of
Christ should throw off that responsibility to this outcast race which
her profession demands of her.
 
To fill up Liberia with an ignorant, inexperienced, halfbarbarized
race, just escaped from the chains of slavery, would be only to
prolong, for ages, the period of struggle and conflict which attends the
inception of new enterprises. Let the church of the north receive these
poor sufferers in the spirit of Christ receive them to the educating
advantages of Christian republican society and schools, until they have
attained to somewhat of a moral and intellectual maturity, and then
assist them in their passage to those shores, where they may put in
practice the lessons they have learned in America.
 
There is a body of men at the north, comparatively small, who have been
doing this and, as the result, this country has already seen examples
of men, formerly slaves, who have rapidly acquired property, reputation,
and education. Talent has been developed, which, considering the
circumstances, is certainly remarkable and, for moral traits of
honesty, kindness, tenderness of feeling,for heroic efforts and
selfdenials, endured for the ransom of brethren and friends yet in
slavery,they have been remarkable to a degree that, considering the
influence under which they were born, is surprising.
 
The writer has lived, for many years, on the frontierline of slave
states, and has had great opportunities of observation among those who
formerly were slaves. They have been in her family as servants and, in
default of any other school to receive them, she has, in many cases, had
them instructed in a family school, with her own children. She has
also the testimony of missionaries, among the fugitives in Canada, in
coincidence with her own experience and her deductions, with regard to
the capabilities of the race, are encouraging in the highest degree.
 
The first desire of the emancipated slave, generally, is for
_education_. There is nothing that they are not willing to give or do to
have their children instructed, and, so far as the writer has observed
herself, or taken the testimony of teachers among them, they are
remarkably intelligent and quick to learn. The results of schools,
founded for them by benevolent individuals in Cincinnati, fully
establish this.
 
The author gives the following statement of facts, on the authority
of Professor C. E. Stowe, then of Lane Seminary, Ohio, with regard
to emancipated slaves, now resident in Cincinnati given to show the
capability of the race, even without any very particular assistance or
encouragement.
 
The initial letters alone are given. They are all residents of
Cincinnati.
 
"B. Furniture maker twenty years in the city worth ten thousand
dollars, all his own earnings a Baptist.
 
"C. Full black stolen from Africa sold in New Orleans been free
fifteen years paid for himself six hundred dollars a farmer owns
several farms in Indiana Presbyterian probably worth fifteen or twenty
thousand dollars, all earned by himself.
 
"K. Full black dealer in real estate worth thirty thousand
dollars about forty years old free six years paid eighteen hundred
dollars for his family member of the Baptist church received a legacy
from his master, which he has taken good care of, and increased.
 
"G. Full black coal dealer about thirty years old worth eighteen
thousand dollars paid for himself twice, being once defrauded to
the amount of sixteen hundred dollars made all his money by his own
effortsmuch of it while a slave, hiring his time of his master, and
doing business for himself a fine, gentlemanly fellow.
 
"W. Threefourths black barber and waiter from Kentucky nineteen
years free paid for self and family over three thousand dollars deacon
in the Baptist church.
 
"G. D. Threefourths black whitewasher from Kentucky nine years
free paid fifteen hundred dollars for self and family recently died,
aged sixty worth six thousand dollars."
 
Professor Stowe says, "With all these, except G, I have been, for
some years, personally acquainted, and make my statements from my own
knowledge."
 
The writer well remembers an aged colored woman, who was employed as a
washerwoman in her fathers family. The daughter of this woman married a
slave. She was a remarkably active and capable young woman, and, by her
industry and thrift, and the most persevering selfdenial, raised nine
hundred dollars for her husbands freedom, which she paid, as she raised
it, into the hands of his master. She yet wanted a hundred dollars of
the price, when he died. She never recovered any of the money.
 
These are but few facts, among multitudes which might be adduced, to
show the selfdenial, energy, patience, and honesty, which the slave has
exhibited in a state of freedom.
 
And let it be remembered that these individuals have thus bravely
succeeded in conquering for themselves comparative wealth and social
position, in the face of every disadvantage and discouragement. The
colored man, by the law of Ohio, cannot be a voter, and, till within a
few years, was even denied the right of testimony in legal suits with
the white. Nor are these instances confined to the State of Ohio. In all
states of the Union we see men, but yesterday burst from the shackles
of slavery, who, by a selfeducating force, which cannot be too
much admired, have risen to highly respectable stations in society.
Pennington, among clergymen, Douglas and Ward, among editors, are well
known instances.
 
If this persecuted race, with every discouragement and disadvantage,
have done thus much, how much more they might do if the Christian church
would act towards them in the spirit of her Lord!
 
This is an age of the world when nations are trembling and convulsed.
A mighty influence is abroad, surging and heaving the world, as with an
earthquake. And is America safe? Every nation that carries in its bosom
great and unredressed injustice has in it the elements of this last
convulsion.
 
For what is this mighty influence thus rousing in all nations and
languages those groanings that cannot be uttered, for mans freedom and
equality?
 
O, Church of Christ, read the signs of the times! Is not this power the
spirit of Him whose kingdom is yet to come, and whose will to be done on
earth as it is in heaven?
 
But who may abide the day of his appearing? "for that day shall burn
as an oven and he shall appear as a swift witness against those that
oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow and the fatherless, and
that _turn aside the stranger in his right_ and he shall break in
pieces the oppressor."
 
Are not these dread words for a nation bearing in her bosom so mighty
an injustice? Christians! every time that you pray that the kingdom
of Christ may come, can you forget that prophecy associates, in dread
fellowship, the _day of vengeance_ with the year of his redeemed?
 
A day of grace is yet held out to us. Both North and South have been
guilty before God and the _Christian church_ has a heavy account to
answer. Not by combining together, to protect injustice and cruelty,
and making a common capital of sin, is this Union to be saved,but
by repentance, justice and mercy for, not surer is the eternal law by
which the millstone sinks in the ocean, than that stronger law, by which
injustice and cruelty shall bring on nations the wrath of Almighty God!
 
How does it come about that alongside of the idea of ponderable
matter, which is derived by abstraction from everyday life, the
physicists set the idea of the existence of another kind of matter,
the ether? The explanation is probably to be sought in those phenomena
which have given rise to the theory of action at a distance, and
in the properties of light which have led to the undulatory theory.
Let us devote a little while to the consideration of these two
subjects.

Outside of physics we know nothing of action at a distance. When
we try to connect cause and effect in the experiences which natural
objects afford us, it seems at first as if there were no other mutual
actions than those of immediate contact, e.g. the communication of
motion by impact, push and pull, heating or inducing combustion by
means of a flame, etc. It is true that even in everyday experience
weight, which is in a sense action at a distance, plays a very
important part. But since in daily experience the weight of bodies
meets us as something constant, something not linked to any cause
which is variable in time or place, we do not in everyday life
speculate as to the cause of gravity, and therefore do not become
conscious of its character as action at a distance. It was Newtons
theory of gravitation that first assigned a cause for gravity by
interpreting it as action at a distance, proceeding from masses.
Newtons theory is probably the greatest stride ever made in
the effort towards the causal nexus of natural phenomena. And yet
this theory evoked a lively sense of discomfort among Newtons
contemporaries, because it seemed to be in conflict with the
principle springing from the rest of experience, that there can be
reciprocal action only through contact, and not through immediate
action at a distance. It is only with reluctance that mans desire
for knowledge endures a dualism of this kind. How was unity to
be preserved in his comprehension of the forces of nature? Either
by trying to look upon contact forces as being themselves distant
forces which admittedly are observable only at a very small
distanceand this was the road which Newtons followers, who were
entirely under the spell of his doctrine, mostly preferred to
take or by assuming that the Newtonian action at a distance is
only _apparently_ immediate action at a distance, but in truth is
conveyed by a medium permeating space, whether by movements or by
elastic deformation of this medium. Thus the endeavour toward a
unified view of the nature of forces leads to the hypothesis of an
ether. This hypothesis, to be sure, did not at first bring with it
any advance in the theory of gravitation or in physics generally,
so that it became customary to treat Newtons law of force as an
axiom not further reducible. But the ether hypothesis was bound
always to play some part in physical science, even if at first only
a latent part.

When in the first half of the nineteenth century the farreaching
similarity was revealed which subsists between the properties of
light and those of elastic waves in ponderable bodies, the ether
hypothesis found fresh support. It appeared beyond question that
light must be interpreted as a vibratory process in an elastic, inert
medium filling up universal space. It also seemed to be a necessary
consequence of the fact that light is capable of polarisation that
this medium, the ether, must be of the nature of a solid body,
because transverse waves are not possible in a fluid, but only in
a solid. Thus the physicists were bound to arrive at the theory
of the "quasirigid" luminiferous ether, the parts of which can
carry out no movements relatively to one another except the small
movements of deformation which correspond to lightwaves.

This theoryalso called the theory of the stationary luminiferous
ethermoreover found a strong support in an experiment which is
also of fundamental importance in the special theory of relativity,
the experiment of Fizeau, from which one was obliged to infer
that the luminiferous ether does not take part in the movements of
bodies. The phenomenon of aberration also favoured the theory of
the quasirigid ether.

The development of the theory of electricity along the path opened
up by Maxwell and Lorentz gave the development of our ideas concerning
the ether quite a peculiar and unexpected turn. For Maxwell himself
the ether indeed still had properties which were purely mechanical,
although of a much more complicated kind than the mechanical
properties of tangible solid bodies. But neither Maxwell nor his
followers succeeded in elaborating a mechanical model for the ether
which might furnish a satisfactory mechanical interpretation of
Maxwells laws of the electromagnetic field. The laws were clear
and simple, the mechanical interpretations clumsy and contradictory.
Almost imperceptibly the theoretical physicists adapted themselves
to a situation which, from the standpoint of their mechanical
programme, was very depressing. They were particularly influenced
by the electrodynamical investigations of Heinrich Hertz. For
whereas they previously had required of a conclusive theory that
it should content itself with the fundamental concepts which belong
exclusively to mechanics e.g. densities, velocities, deformations,
stresses they gradually accustomed themselves to admitting electric and
magnetic force as fundamental concepts side by side with those of
mechanics, without requiring a mechanical interpretation for them.
Thus the purely mechanical view of nature was gradually abandoned.
But this change led to a fundamental dualism which in the longrun
was insupportable. A way of escape was now sought in the reverse
direction, by reducing the principles of mechanics to those
of electricity, and this especially as confidence in the strict
validity of the equations of Newtons mechanics was shaken by the
experiments with betarays and rapid kathode rays.

This dualism still confronts us in unextenuated form in the theory
of Hertz, where matter appears not only as the bearer of velocities,
kinetic energy, and mechanical pressures, but also as the bearer of
electromagnetic fields. Since such fields also occur _in vacuo_i.e.
in free etherthe ether also appears as bearer of electromagnetic
fields. The ether appears indistinguishable in its functions from
ordinary matter. Within matter it takes part in the motion of matter
and in empty space it has everywhere a velocity so that the ether
has a definitely assigned velocity throughout the whole of space.
There is no fundamental difference between Hertzs ether and
ponderable matter which in part subsists in the ether.

The Hertz theory suffered not only from the defect of ascribing
to matter and ether, on the one hand mechanical states, and on the
other hand electrical states, which do not stand in any conceivable
relation to each other it was also at variance with the result of
Fizeaus important experiment on the velocity of the propagation
of light in moving fluids, and with other established experimental
results.

Such was the state of things when H. A. Lorentz entered upon the
scene. He brought theory into harmony with experience by means of
a wonderful simplification of theoretical principles. He achieved
this, the most important advance in the theory of electricity since
Maxwell, by taking from ether its mechanical, and from matter its
electromagnetic qualities. As in empty space, so too in the interior
of material bodies, the ether, and not matter viewed atomistically,
was exclusively the seat of electromagnetic fields. According to
Lorentz the elementary particles of matter alone are capable of
carrying out movements their electromagnetic activity is entirely
confined to the carrying of electric charges. Thus Lorentz succeeded
in reducing all electromagnetic happenings to Maxwells equations
for free space.

As to the mechanical nature of the Lorentzian ether, it may be said
of it, in a somewhat playful spirit, that immobility is the only
mechanical property of which it has not been deprived by H. A.
Lorentz. It may be added that the whole change in the conception
of the ether which the special theory of relativity brought about,
consisted in taking away from the ether its last mechanical quality,
namely, its immobility. How this is to be understood will forthwith
be expounded.

The spacetime theory and the kinematics of the special theory
of relativity were modelled on the MaxwellLorentz theory of the
electromagnetic field. This theory therefore satisfies the conditions
of the special theory of relativity, but when viewed from the latter
it acquires a novel aspect. For if K be a system of coordinates
relatively to which the Lorentzian ether is at rest, the
MaxwellLorentz equations are valid primarily with reference to K.
But by the special theory of relativity the same equations without
any change of meaning also hold in relation to any new system of
coordinates K which is moving in uniform translation relatively
to K. Now comes the anxious questionWhy must I in the theory
distinguish the K system above all K systems, which are physically
equivalent to it in all respects, by assuming that the ether
is at rest relatively to the K system? For the theoretician such
an asymmetry in the theoretical structure, with no corresponding
asymmetry in the system of experience, is intolerable. If we assume
the ether to be at rest relatively to K, but in motion relatively
to K, the physical equivalence of K and K seems to me from the
logical standpoint, not indeed downright incorrect, but nevertheless
inacceptable.

The next position which it was possible to take up in face of this
state of things appeared to be the following. The ether does not
exist at all. The electromagnetic fields are not states of a medium,
and are not bound down to any bearer, but they are independent
realities which are not reducible to anything else, exactly like
the atoms of ponderable matter. This conception suggests itself
the more readily as, according to Lorentzs theory, electromagnetic
radiation, like ponderable matter, brings impulse and energy with
it, and as, according to the special theory of relativity, both
matter and radiation are but special forms of distributed energy,
ponderable mass losing its isolation and appearing as a special
form of energy.

More careful reflection teaches us, however, that the special theory
of relativity does not compel us to deny ether. We may assume the
existence of an ether only we must give up ascribing a definite
state of motion to it, i.e. we must by abstraction take from it the
last mechanical characteristic which Lorentz had still left it. We
shall see later that this point of view, the conceivability of which
I shall at once endeavour to make more intelligible by a somewhat
halting comparison, is justified by the results of the general
theory of relativity.

Think of waves on the surface of water. Here we can describe two
entirely different things. Either we may observe how the undulatory
surface forming the boundary between water and air alters in the course
of time or elsewith the help of small floats, for instancewe
can observe how the position of the separate particles of water
alters in the course of time. If the existence of such floats for
tracking the motion of the particles of a fluid were a fundamental
impossibility in physicsif, in fact, nothing else whatever were
observable than the shape of the space occupied by the water as it
varies in time, we should have no ground for the assumption that
water consists of movable particles. But all the same we could
characterise it as a medium.

We have something like this in the electromagnetic field. For we may
picture the field to ourselves as consisting of lines of force.  If
we wish to interpret these lines of force to ourselves as something
material in the ordinary sense, we are tempted to interpret the
dynamic processes as motions of these lines of force, such that each
separate line of force is tracked through the course of time. It is
well known, however, that this way of regarding the electromagnetic
field leads to contradictions.

Generalising we must say thisThere may be supposed to be extended
physical objects to which the idea of motion cannot be applied.
They may not be thought of as consisting of particles which allow
themselves to be separately tracked through time. In Minkowskis
idiom this is expressed as followsNot every extended conformation
in the fourdimensional world can be regarded as composed
of worldthreads. The special theory of relativity forbids us to
assume the ether to consist of particles observable through time,
but the hypothesis of ether in itself is not in conflict with the
special theory of relativity. Only we must be on our guard against
ascribing a state of motion to the ether.

Certainly, from the standpoint of the special theory of relativity,
the ether hypothesis appears at first to be an empty hypothesis. In
the equations of the electromagnetic field there occur, in addition
to the densities of the electric charge, _only_ the intensities
of the field. The career of electromagnetic processes _in vacuo_
appears to be completely determined by these equations, uninfluenced
by other physical quantities. The electromagnetic fields appear as
ultimate, irreducible realities, and at first it seems superfluous
to postulate a homogeneous, isotropic ethermedium, and to envisage
electromagnetic fields as states of this medium.

But on the other hand there is a weighty argument to be adduced
in favour of the ether hypothesis. To deny the ether is ultimately
to assume that empty space has no physical qualities whatever. The
fundamental facts of mechanics do not harmonize with this view.
For the mechanical behaviour of a corporeal system hovering freely
in empty space depends not only on relative positions distances
and relative velocities, but also on its state of rotation, which
physically may be taken as a characteristic not appertaining to the
system in itself. In order to be able to look upon the rotation of
the system, at least formally, as something real, Newton objectivises
space.

Since he classes his absolute space together with real things, for
him rotation relative to an absolute space is also something real.
Newton might no less well have called his absolute space "Ether"
what is essential is merely that besides observable objects, another
thing, which is not perceptible, must be looked upon as real,
to enable acceleration or rotation to be looked upon as something
real.

It is true that Mach tried to avoid having to accept as real something
which is not observable by endeavouring to substitute in mechanics
a mean acceleration with reference to the totality of the masses in
the universe in place of an acceleration with reference to absolute
space. But inertial resistance opposed to relative acceleration of
distant masses presupposes action at a distance and as the modern
physicist does not believe that he may accept this action at
a distance, he comes back once more, if he follows Mach, to the
ether, which has to serve as medium for the effects of inertia. But
this conception of the ether to which we are led by Machs way of
thinking differs essentially from the ether as conceived by Newton,
by Fresnel, and by Lorentz. Machs ether not only _conditions_ the
behaviour of inert masses, but _is also conditioned_ in its state
by them.

Machs idea finds its full development in the ether of the general
theory of relativity. According to this theory the metrical
qualities of the continuum of spacetime differ in the environment
of different points of spacetime, and are partly conditioned by the
matter existing outside of the territory under consideration.  This
spacetime variability of the reciprocal relations of the standards
of space and time, or, perhaps, the recognition of the fact that
"empty space" in its physical relation is neither homogeneous nor
isotropic, compelling us to describe its state by ten functions the
gravitation potentials g_mn, has, I think, finally disposed of
the view that space is physically empty. But therewith the
conception of the ether has again acquired an intelligible content,
although this content differs widely from that of the ether of the
mechanical undulatory theory of light.  The ether of the general
theory of relativity is a medium which is itself devoid of _all_
mechanical and kinematical qualities, but helps to determine
mechanical and electromagnetic events.

What is fundamentally new in the ether of the general theory of
relativity as opposed to the ether of Lorentz consists in this, that
the state of the former is at every place determined by connections
with the matter and the state of the ether in neighbouring places,
which are amenable to law in the form of differential equations
whereas the state of the Lorentzian ether in the absence of
electromagnetic fields is conditioned by nothing outside itself,
and is everywhere the same. The ether of the general theory of
relativity is transmuted conceptually into the ether of Lorentz if
we substitute constants for the functions of space which describe
the former, disregarding the causes which condition its state.
Thus we may also say, I think, that the ether of the general theory
of relativity is the outcome of the Lorentzian ether, through
relativation.

As to the part which the new ether is to play in the physics of
the future we are not yet clear. We know that it determines the
metrical relations in the spacetime continuum, e.g. the configurative
possibilities of solid bodies as well as the gravitational fields
but we do not know whether it has an essential share in the structure
of the electrical elementary particles constituting matter. Nor do
we know whether it is only in the proximity of ponderable masses
that its structure differs essentially from that of the Lorentzian
ether whether the geometry of spaces of cosmic extent is approximately
Euclidean. But we can assert by reason of the relativistic equations
of gravitation that there must be a departure from Euclidean
relations, with spaces of cosmic order of magnitude, if there exists
a positive mean density, no matter how small, of the matter in the
universe. In this case the universe must of necessity be spatially
unbounded and of finite magnitude, its magnitude being determined
by the value of that mean density.

If we consider the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field
from the standpoint of the ether hypothesis, we find a remarkable
difference between the two. There can be no space nor any part
of space without gravitational potentials for these confer upon
space its metrical qualities, without which it cannot be imagined
at all. The existence of the gravitational field is inseparably
bound up with the existence of space. On the other hand a part of
space may very well be imagined without an electromagnetic field
thus in contrast with the gravitational field, the electromagnetic
field seems to be only secondarily linked to the ether, the formal
nature of the electromagnetic field being as yet in no way determined
by that of gravitational ether. From the present state of theory
it looks as if the electromagnetic field, as opposed to the
gravitational field, rests upon an entirely new formal _motif_,
as though nature might just as well have endowed the gravitational
ether with fields of quite another type, for example, with fields
of a scalar potential, instead of fields of the electromagnetic
type.

Since according to our present conceptions the elementary particles
of matter are also, in their essence, nothing else than condensations
of the electromagnetic field, our present view of the universe
presents two realities which are completely separated from each other
conceptually, although connected causally, namely, gravitational ether
and electromagnetic field, oras they might also be calledspace
and matter.

Of course it would be a great advance if we could succeed in
comprehending the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field
together as one unified conformation. Then for the first time the
epoch of theoretical physics founded by Faraday and Maxwell would
reach a satisfactory conclusion. The contrast between ether and
matter would fade away, and, through the general theory of relativity,
the whole of physics would become a complete system of thought,
like geometry, kinematics, and the theory of gravitation.  An
exceedingly ingenious attempt in this direction has been made by
the mathematician H. Weyl but I do not believe that his theory will
hold its ground in relation to reality. Further, in contemplating
the immediate future of theoretical physics we ought not unconditionally
to reject the possibility that the facts comprised in the quantum
theory may set bounds to the field theory beyond which it cannot
pass.

Recapitulating, we may say that according to the general theory of
relativity space is endowed with physical qualities in this sense,
therefore, there exists an ether. According to the general theory
of relativity space without ether is unthinkable for in such space
there not only would be no propagation of light, but also no possibility
of existence for standards of space and time measuringrods and
clocks, nor therefore any spacetime intervals in the physical
sense. But this ether may not be thought of as endowed with the
quality characteristic of ponderable media, as consisting of parts
which may be tracked through time. The idea of motion may not be
applied to it.




GEOMETRY AND EXPERIENCE

An expanded form of an Address to the Prussian Academy of Sciences
in Berlin on January 27th, 1921.



One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other
sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable,
while those of all other sciences are to some extent debatable and
in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.
In spite of this, the investigator in another department of science
would not need to envy the mathematician if the laws of mathematics
referred to objects of our mere imagination, and not to objects
of reality. For it cannot occasion surprise that different persons
should arrive at the same logical conclusions when they have already
agreed upon the fundamental laws axioms, as well as the methods
by which other laws are to be deduced therefrom. But there is another
reason for the high repute of mathematics, in that it is mathematics
which affords the exact natural sciences a certain measure of
security, to which without mathematics they could not attain.

At this point an enigma presents itself which in all ages has agitated
inquiring minds. How can it be that mathematics, being after all
a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is
so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality? Is human reason,
then, without experience, merely by taking thought, able to fathom
the properties of real things.

In my opinion the answer to this question is, briefly, thisAs far
as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain
and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.
It seems to me that complete clearness as to this state of things
first became common property through that new departure in mathematics
which is known by the name of mathematical logic or "Axiomatics."
The progress achieved by axiomatics consists in its having neatly
separated the logicalformal from its objective or intuitive
content according to axiomatics the logicalformal alone forms
the subjectmatter of mathematics, which is not concerned with the
intuitive or other content associated with the logicalformal.

Let us for a moment consider from this point of view any axiom of
geometry, for instance, the followingThrough two points in space
there always passes one and only one straight line. How is this
axiom to be interpreted in the older sense and in the more modern
sense?

The older interpretationEvery one knows what a straight line
is, and what a point is. Whether this knowledge springs from an
ability of the human mind or from experience, from some collaboration
of the two or from some other source, is not for the mathematician
to decide. He leaves the question to the philosopher. Being based
upon this knowledge, which precedes all mathematics, the axiom
stated above is, like all other axioms, selfevident, that is, it
is the expression of a part of this _a priori_ knowledge.

The more modern interpretationGeometry treats of entities which
are denoted by the words straight line, point, etc. These entities
do not take for granted any knowledge or intuition whatever, but
they presuppose only the validity of the axioms, such as the one
stated above, which are to be taken in a purely formal sense, i.e.
as void of all content of intuition or experience. These axioms are
free creations of the human mind. All other propositions of geometry
are logical inferences from the axioms which are to be taken in
the nominalistic sense only. The matter of which geometry treats
is first defined by the axioms. Schlick in his book on epistemology has
therefore characterised axioms very aptly as "implicit definitions."

This view of axioms, advocated by modern axiomatics, purges mathematics
of all extraneous elements, and thus dispels the mystic obscurity
which formerly surrounded the principles of mathematics.

But a presentation of its principles thus clarified makes it also
evident that mathematics as such cannot predicate anything about
perceptual objects or real objects. In axiomatic geometry the words
"point," "straight line," etc., stand only for empty conceptual
schemata. That which gives them substance is not relevant to
mathematics.

Yet on the other hand it is certain that mathematics generally,
and particularly geometry, owes its existence to the need which
was felt of learning something about the relations of real things
to one another. The very word geometry, which, of course, means
earthmeasuring, proves this. For earthmeasuring has to do with
the possibilities of the disposition of certain natural objects
with respect to one another, namely, with parts of the earth,
measuringlines, measuringwands, etc. It is clear that the system
of concepts of axiomatic geometry alone cannot make any assertions
as to the relations of real objects of this kind, which we will
call practicallyrigid bodies. To be able to make such assertions,
geometry must be stripped of its merely logicalformal character
by the coordination of real objects of experience with the empty
conceptual framework of axiomatic geometry. To accomplish this,
we need only add the propositionSolid bodies are related, with
respect to their possible dispositions, as are bodies in Euclidean
geometry of three dimensions. Then the propositions of Euclid contain
affirmations as to the relations of practicallyrigid bodies.

Geometry thus completed is evidently a natural science we may in
fact regard it as the most ancient branch of physics. Its affirmations
rest essentially on induction from experience, but not on logical
inferences only. We will call this completed geometry "practical
geometry," and shall distinguish it in what follows from "purely
axiomatic geometry." The question whether the practical geometry
of the universe is Euclidean or not has a clear meaning, and its
answer can only be furnished by experience. All linear measurement
in physics is practical geometry in this sense, so too is geodetic
and astronomical linear measurement, if we call to our help the
law of experience that light is propagated in a straight line, and
indeed in a straight line in the sense of practical geometry.

I attach special importance to the view of geometry which I
have just set forth, because without it I should have been unable
to formulate the theory of relativity. Without it the following
reflection would have been impossibleIn a system of reference
rotating relatively to an inert system, the laws of disposition of
rigid bodies do not correspond to the rules of Euclidean geometry
on account of the Lorentz contraction thus if we admit noninert
systems we must abandon Euclidean geometry. The decisive step in
the transition to general covariant equations would certainly not
have been taken if the above interpretation had not served as a
steppingstone. If we deny the relation between the body of axiomatic
Euclidean geometry and the practicallyrigid body of reality,
we readily arrive at the following view, which was entertained by
that acute and profound thinker, H. PoincareEuclidean geometry
is distinguished above all other imaginable axiomatic geometries
by its simplicity. Now since axiomatic geometry by itself contains
no assertions as to the reality which can be experienced, but can
do so only in combination with physical laws, it should be possible
and reasonablewhatever may be the nature of realityto retain
Euclidean geometry. For if contradictions between theory and
experience manifest themselves, we should rather decide to change
physical laws than to change axiomatic Euclidean geometry. If we
deny the relation between the practicallyrigid body and geometry,
we shall indeed not easily free ourselves from the convention
that Euclidean geometry is to be retained as the simplest. Why
is the equivalence of the practicallyrigid body and the body of
geometrywhich suggests itself so readilydenied by Poincare and
other investigators? Simply because under closer inspection the
real solid bodies in nature are not rigid, because their geometrical
behaviour, that is, their possibilities of relative disposition,
depend upon temperature, external forces, etc. Thus the original,
immediate relation between geometry and physical reality appears
destroyed, and we feel impelled toward the following more general
view, which characterizes Poincares standpoint. Geometry G
predicates nothing about the relations of real things, but only
geometry together with the purport P of physical laws can do so.
Using symbols, we may say that only the sum of G  P is subject
to the control of experience. Thus G may be chosen arbitrarily,
and also parts of P all these laws are conventions. All that
is necessary to avoid contradictions is to choose the remainder of
P so that G and the whole of P are together in accord with
experience. Envisaged in this way, axiomatic geometry and the part
of natural law which has been given a conventional status appear
as epistemologically equivalent.

_Sub specie aeterni_ Poincare, in my opinion, is right. The idea
of the measuringrod and the idea of the clock coordinated with it
in the theory of relativity do not find their exact correspondence
in the real world. It is also clear that the solid body and the
clock do not in the conceptual edifice of physics play the part of
irreducible elements, but that of composite structures, which may
not play any independent part in theoretical physics. But it is my
conviction that in the present stage of development of theoretical
physics these ideas must still be employed as independent ideas
for we are still far from possessing such certain knowledge
of theoretical principles as to be able to give exact theoretical
constructions of solid bodies and clocks.

Further, as to the objection that there are no really rigid bodies
in nature, and that therefore the properties predicated of rigid
bodies do not apply to physical reality,this objection is by
no means so radical as might appear from a hasty examination. For
it is not a difficult task to determine the physical state of a
measuringrod so accurately that its behaviour relatively to other
measuringbodies shall be sufficiently free from ambiguity to allow
it to be substituted for the "rigid" body. It is to measuringbodies
of this kind that statements as to rigid bodies must be referred.

All practical geometry is based upon a principle which is accessible
to experience, and which we will now try to realise. We will
call that which is enclosed between two boundaries, marked upon a
practicallyrigid body, a tract. We imagine two practicallyrigid
bodies, each with a tract marked out on it. These two tracts are
said to be "equal to one another" if the boundaries of the one tract
can be brought to coincide permanently with the boundaries of the
other. We now assume that

If two tracts are found to be equal once and anywhere, they are
equal always and everywhere.

Not only the practical geometry of Euclid, but also its nearest
generalisation, the practical geometry of Riemann, and therewith
the general theory of relativity, rest upon this assumption. Of the
experimental reasons which warrant this assumption I will mention
only one. The phenomenon of the propagation of light in empty space
assigns a tract, namely, the appropriate path of light, to each
interval of local time, and conversely. Thence it follows that
the above assumption for tracts must also hold good for intervals
of clocktime in the theory of relativity. Consequently it may be
formulated as followsIf two ideal clocks are going at the same
rate at any time and at any place being then in immediate proximity
to each other, they will always go at the same rate, no matter where
and when they are again compared with each other at one place.If
this law were not valid for real clocks, the proper frequencies
for the separate atoms of the same chemical element would not be
in such exact agreement as experience demonstrates. The existence
of sharp spectral lines is a convincing experimental proof of the
abovementioned principle of practical geometry. This is the ultimate
foundation in fact which enables us to speak with meaning of the
mensuration, in Riemanns sense of the word, of the fourdimensional
continuum of spacetime.

The question whether the structure of this continuum is Euclidean,
or in accordance with Riemanns general scheme, or otherwise,
is, according to the view which is here being advocated, properly
speaking a physical question which must be answered by experience,
and not a question of a mere convention to be selected on practical
grounds. Riemanns geometry will be the right thing if the laws
of disposition of practicallyrigid bodies are transformable into
those of the bodies of Euclids geometry with an exactitude which
increases in proportion as the dimensions of the part of spacetime
under consideration are diminished.

It is true that this proposed physical interpretation of geometry
breaks down when applied immediately to spaces of submolecular
order of magnitude. But nevertheless, even in questions as
to the constitution of elementary particles, it retains part of
its importance. For even when it is a question of describing the
electrical elementary particles constituting matter, the attempt
may still be made to ascribe physical importance to those ideas
of fields which have been physically defined for the purpose
of describing the geometrical behaviour of bodies which are large
as compared with the molecule. Success alone can decide as to the
justification of such an attempt, which postulates physical reality
for the fundamental principles of Riemanns geometry outside of the
domain of their physical definitions. It might possibly turn out
that this extrapolation has no better warrant than the extrapolation
of the idea of temperature to parts of a body of molecular order
of magnitude.

It appears less problematical to extend the ideas of practical
geometry to spaces of cosmic order of magnitude. It might, of course,
be objected that a construction composed of solid rods departs more
and more from ideal rigidity in proportion as its spatial extent
becomes greater. But it will hardly be possible, I think, to assign
fundamental significance to this objection. Therefore the question
whether the universe is spatially finite or not seems to me
decidedly a pregnant question in the sense of practical geometry.
I do not even consider it impossible that this question will be
answered before long by astronomy. Let us call to mind what the
general theory of relativity teaches in this respect. It offers
two possibilities

1. The universe is spatially infinite. This can be so only if the
average spatial density of the matter in universal space, concentrated
in the stars, vanishes, i.e. if the ratio of the total mass of the
stars to the magnitude of the space through which they are scattered
approximates indefinitely to the value zero when the spaces taken
into consideration are constantly greater and greater.

2. The universe is spatially finite. This must be so, if there is
a mean density of the ponderable matter in universal space differing
from zero. The smaller that mean density, the greater is the volume
of universal space.

I must not fail to mention that a theoretical argument can be adduced in
favour of the hypothesis of a finite universe. The general theory
of relativity teaches that the inertia of a given body is greater as
there are more ponderable masses in proximity to it thus it seems
very natural to reduce the total effect of inertia of a body to
action and reaction between it and the other bodies in the universe,
as indeed, ever since Newtons time, gravity has been completely
reduced to action and reaction between bodies.  From the equations
of the general theory of relativity it can be deduced that this
total reduction of inertia to reciprocal action between massesas
required by E. Mach, for exampleis possible only if the universe
is spatially finite.

On many physicists and astronomers this argument makes no impression.
Experience alone can finally decide which of the two possibilities
is realised in nature. How can experience furnish an answer? At first
it might seem possible to determine the mean density of matter by
observation of that part of the universe which is accessible to our
perception. This hope is illusory. The distribution of the visible
stars is extremely irregular, so that we on no account may venture
to set down the mean density of starmatter in the universe as
equal, let us say, to the mean density in the Milky Way. In any
case, however great the space examined may be, we could not feel
convinced that there were no more stars beyond that space. So it
seems impossible to estimate the mean density. But there is another
road, which seems to me more practicable, although it also presents
great difficulties. For if we inquire into the deviations shown
by the consequences of the general theory of relativity which are
accessible to experience, when these are compared with the consequences
of the Newtonian theory, we first of all find a deviation which
shows itself in close proximity to gravitating mass, and has been
confirmed in the case of the planet Mercury. But if the universe
is spatially finite there is a second deviation from the Newtonian
theory, which, in the language of the Newtonian theory, may be
expressed thusThe gravitational field is in its nature such as
if it were produced, not only by the ponderable masses, but also by
a massdensity of negative sign, distributed uniformly throughout
space. Since this factitious massdensity would have to be enormously
small, it could make its presence felt only in gravitating systems
of very great extent.

Assuming that we know, let us say, the statistical distribution
of the stars in the Milky Way, as well as their masses, then by
Newtons law we can calculate the gravitational field and the mean
velocities which the stars must have, so that the Milky Way should
not collapse under the mutual attraction of its stars, but should
maintain its actual extent. Now if the actual velocities of the stars,
which can, of course, be measured, were smaller than the calculated
velocities, we should have a proof that the actual attractions
at great distances are smaller than by Newtons law. From such a
deviation it could be proved indirectly that the universe is finite.
It would even be possible to estimate its spatial magnitude.

Can we picture to ourselves a threedimensional universe which is
finite, yet unbounded?

The usual answer to this question is "No," but that is not the right
answer. The purpose of the following remarks is to show that the
answer should be "Yes." I want to show that without any extraordinary
difficulty we can illustrate the theory of a finite universe by
means of a mental image to which, with some practice, we shall soon
grow accustomed.

First of all, an observation of epistemological nature. A
geometricalphysical theory as such is incapable of being directly
pictured, being merely a system of concepts. But these concepts
serve the purpose of bringing a multiplicity of real or imaginary
sensory experiences into connection in the mind. To "visualise"
a theory, or bring it home to ones mind, therefore means to give
a representation to that abundance of experiences for which the
theory supplies the schematic arrangement. In the present case we
have to ask ourselves how we can represent that relation of solid
bodies with respect to their reciprocal disposition contact which
corresponds to the theory of a finite universe. There is really
nothing new in what I have to say about this but innumerable
questions addressed to me prove that the requirements of those who
thirst for knowledge of these matters have not yet been completely
satisfied.

So, will the initiated please pardon me, if part of what I shall
bring forward has long been known?

What do we wish to express when we say that our space is infinite?
Nothing more than that we might lay any number whatever of bodies
of equal sizes side by side without ever filling space. Suppose
that we are provided with a great many wooden cubes all of the
same size. In accordance with Euclidean geometry we can place them
above, beside, and behind one another so as to fill a part of space
of any dimensions but this construction would never be finished
we could go on adding more and more cubes without ever finding
that there was no more room. That is what we wish to express when
we say that space is infinite. It would be better to say that space
is infinite in relation to practicallyrigid bodies, assuming that
the laws of disposition for these bodies are given by Euclidean
geometry.

Another example of an infinite continuum is the plane. On a plane
surface we may lay squares of cardboard so that each side of any
square has the side of another square adjacent to it. The construction
is never finished we can always go on laying squaresif their laws
of disposition correspond to those of plane figures of Euclidean
geometry. The plane is therefore infinite in relation to the
cardboard squares. Accordingly we say that the plane is an infinite
continuum of two dimensions, and space an infinite continuum of
three dimensions. What is here meant by the number of dimensions,
I think I may assume to be known.

Now we take an example of a twodimensional continuum which is
finite, but unbounded. We imagine the surface of a large globe and
a quantity of small paper discs, all of the same size. We place
one of the discs anywhere on the surface of the globe. If we move
the disc about, anywhere we like, on the surface of the globe,
we do not come upon a limit or boundary anywhere on the journey.
Therefore we say that the spherical surface of the globe is an
unbounded continuum. Moreover, the spherical surface is a finite
continuum. For if we stick the paper discs on the globe, so that
no disc overlaps another, the surface of the globe will finally
become so full that there is no room for another disc. This simply
means that the spherical surface of the globe is finite in relation
to the paper discs. Further, the spherical surface is a nonEuclidean
continuum of two dimensions, that is to say, the laws of disposition
for the rigid figures lying in it do not agree with those of the
Euclidean plane. This can be shown in the following way. Place
a paper disc on the spherical surface, and around it in a circle
place six more discs, each of which is to be surrounded in turn
by six discs, and so on. If this construction is made on a plane
surface, we have an uninterrupted disposition in which there are
six discs touching every disc except those which lie on the outside.

Figure 1 Discs maximally packed on a plane

On the spherical surface the construction also seems to promise
success at the outset, and the smaller the radius of the disc
in proportion to that of the sphere, the more promising it seems.
But as the construction progresses it becomes more and more patent
that the disposition of the discs in the manner indicated, without
interruption, is not possible, as it should be possible by Euclidean
geometry of the the plane surface. In this way creatures which
cannot leave the spherical surface, and cannot even peep out from
the spherical surface into threedimensional space, might discover,
merely by experimenting with discs, that their twodimensional
"space" is not Euclidean, but spherical space.

From the latest results of the theory of relativity it is probable
that our threedimensional space is also approximately spherical,
that is, that the laws of disposition of rigid bodies in it are
not given by Euclidean geometry, but approximately by spherical
geometry, if only we consider parts of space which are sufficiently
great. Now this is the place where the readers imagination boggles.
"Nobody can imagine this thing," he cries indignantly. "It can be
said, but cannot be thought. I can represent to myself a spherical
surface well enough, but nothing analogous to it in three dimensions."

Figure 2 A circle projected from a sphere onto a plane

We must try to surmount this barrier in the mind, and the patient
reader will see that it is by no means a particularly difficult
task. For this purpose we will first give our attention once more to
the geometry of twodimensional spherical surfaces. In the adjoining
figure let _K_ be the spherical surface, touched at _S_ by a plane,
_E_, which, for facility of presentation, is shown in the drawing as
a bounded surface. Let _L_ be a disc on the spherical surface.  Now
let us imagine that at the point _N_ of the spherical surface,
diametrically opposite to _S_, there is a luminous point, throwing a
shadow _L_ of the disc _L_ upon the plane _E_. Every point on the
sphere has its shadow on the plane. If the disc on the sphere _K_ is
moved, its shadow _L_ on the plane _E_ also moves. When the disc
_L_ is at _S_, it almost exactly coincides with its shadow.  If it
moves on the spherical surface away from _S_ upwards, the disc
shadow _L_ on the plane also moves away from _S_ on the plane
outwards, growing bigger and bigger. As the disc _L_ approaches the
luminous point _N_, the shadow moves off to infinity, and becomes
infinitely great.

Now we put the question, What are the laws of disposition of the
discshadows _L_ on the plane _E_? Evidently they are exactly the
same as the laws of disposition of the discs _L_ on the spherical
surface. For to each original figure on _K_ there is a corresponding
shadow figure on _E_. If two discs on _K_ are touching, their
shadows on _E_ also touch. The shadowgeometry on the plane agrees
with the the discgeometry on the sphere. If we call the discshadows
rigid figures, then spherical geometry holds good on the plane _E_
with respect to these rigid figures. Moreover, the plane is finite
with respect to the discshadows, since only a finite number of
the shadows can find room on the plane.

At this point somebody will say, "That is nonsense. The discshadows
are _not_ rigid figures. We have only to move a twofoot rule about
on the plane _E_ to convince ourselves that the shadows constantly
increase in size as they move away from _S_ on the plane towards
infinity." But what if the twofoot rule were to behave on the
plane _E_ in the same way as the discshadows _L_? It would then
be impossible to show that the shadows increase in size as they
move away from _S_ such an assertion would then no longer have
any meaning whatever. In fact the only objective assertion that can
be made about the discshadows is just this, that they are related
in exactly the same way as are the rigid discs on the spherical
surface in the sense of Euclidean geometry.

We must carefully bear in mind that our statement as to the growth
of the discshadows, as they move away from _S_ towards infinity,
has in itself no objective meaning, as long as we are unable to
employ Euclidean rigid bodies which can be moved about on the plane
_E_ for the purpose of comparing the size of the discshadows. In
respect of the laws of disposition of the shadows _L_, the point
_S_ has no special privileges on the plane any more than on the
spherical surface.

The representation given above of spherical geometry on the
plane is important for us, because it readily allows itself to be
transferred to the threedimensional case.

Let us imagine a point _S_ of our space, and a great number
of small spheres, _L_, which can all be brought to coincide with
one another. But these spheres are not to be rigid in the sense
of Euclidean geometry their radius is to increase in the sense
of Euclidean geometry when they are moved away from _S_ towards
infinity, and this increase is to take place in exact accordance
with the same law as applies to the increase of the radii of the
discshadows _L_ on the plane.

After having gained a vivid mental image of the geometrical
behaviour of our _L_ spheres, let us assume that in our space there
are no rigid bodies at all in the sense of Euclidean geometry, but
only bodies having the behaviour of our _L_ spheres. Then we shall
have a vivid representation of threedimensional spherical space,
or, rather of threedimensional spherical geometry. Here our spheres
must be called "rigid" spheres. Their increase in size as they
depart from _S_ is not to be detected by measuring with
measuringrods, any more than in the case of the discshadows on
_E_, because the standards of measurement behave in the same way as
the spheres. Space is homogeneous, that is to say, the same
spherical configurations are possible in the environment of all
points. Our space is finite, because, in consequence of the
"growth" of the spheres, only a finite number of them can find room
in space.

 This is intelligible without calculationbut only for the
twodimensional caseif we revert once more to the case of the disc
on the surface of the sphere.

In this way, by using as steppingstones the practice in thinking
and visualisation which Euclidean geometry gives us, we have acquired
a mental picture of spherical geometry. We may without difficulty
impart more depth and vigour to these ideas by carrying out special
imaginary constructions. Nor would it be difficult to represent the
case of what is called elliptical geometry in an analogous manner.
My only aim today has been to show that the human faculty of
visualisation is by no means bound to capitulate to nonEuclidean
geometry.



PREFACE

 December, 1916

The present book is intended, as far as possible, to give an exact
insight into the theory of Relativity to those readers who, from a
general scientific and philosophical point of view, are interested in
the theory, but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus
of theoretical physics. The work presumes a standard of education
corresponding to that of a university matriculation examination, and,
despite the shortness of the book, a fair amount of patience and force
of will on the part of the reader. The author has spared himself no
pains in his endeavour to present the main ideas in the simplest and
most intelligible form, and on the whole, in the sequence and
connection in which they actually originated. In the interest of
clearness, it appeared to me inevitable that I should repeat myself
frequently, without paying the slightest attention to the elegance of
the presentation. I adhered scrupulously to the precept of that
brilliant theoretical physicist L. Boltzmann, according to whom
matters of elegance ought to be left to the tailor and to the cobbler.
I make no pretence of having withheld from the reader difficulties
which are inherent to the subject. On the other hand, I have purposely
treated the empirical physical foundations of the theory in a
"stepmotherly" fashion, so that readers unfamiliar with physics may
not feel like the wanderer who was unable to see the forest for the
trees. May the book bring some one a few happy hours of suggestive
thought!

PART I

THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY

PHYSICAL MEANING OF GEOMETRICAL PROPOSITIONS


In your schooldays most of you who read this book made acquaintance
with the noble building of Euclids geometry, and you remember 
perhaps with more respect than love  the magnificent structure, on
the lofty staircase of which you were chased about for uncounted hours
by conscientious teachers. By reason of our past experience, you would
certainly regard everyone with disdain who should pronounce even the
most outoftheway proposition of this science to be untrue. But
perhaps this feeling of proud certainty would leave you immediately if
some one were to ask you "What, then, do you mean by the assertion
that these propositions are true?" Let us proceed to give this
question a little consideration.

Geometry sets out form certain conceptions such as "plane," "point,"
and "straight line," with which we are able to associate more or less
definite ideas, and from certain simple propositions axioms which,
in virtue of these ideas, we are inclined to accept as "true." Then,
on the basis of a logical process, the justification of which we feel
ourselves compelled to admit, all remaining propositions are shown to
follow from those axioms, i.e. they are proven. A proposition is then
correct "true" when it has been derived in the recognised manner
from the axioms. The question of "truth" of the individual geometrical
propositions is thus reduced to one of the "truth" of the axioms. Now
it has long been known that the last question is not only unanswerable
by the methods of geometry, but that it is in itself entirely without
meaning. We cannot ask whether it is true that only one straight line
goes through two points. We can only say that Euclidean geometry deals
with things called "straight lines," to each of which is ascribed the
property of being uniquely determined by two points situated on it.
The concept "true" does not tally with the assertions of pure
geometry, because by the word "true" we are eventually in the habit of
designating always the correspondence with a "real" object geometry,
however, is not concerned with the relation of the ideas involved in
it to objects of experience, but only with the logical connection of
these ideas among themselves.

It is not difficult to understand why, in spite of this, we feel
constrained to call the propositions of geometry "true." Geometrical
ideas correspond to more or less exact objects in nature, and these
last are undoubtedly the exclusive cause of the genesis of those
ideas. Geometry ought to refrain from such a course, in order to give
to its structure the largest possible logical unity. The practice, for
example, of seeing in a "distance" two marked positions on a
practically rigid body is something which is lodged deeply in our
habit of thought. We are accustomed further to regard three points as
being situated on a straight line, if their apparent positions can be
made to coincide for observation with one eye, under suitable choice
of our place of observation.

If, in pursuance of our habit of thought, we now supplement the
propositions of Euclidean geometry by the single proposition that two
points on a practically rigid body always correspond to the same
distance lineinterval, independently of any changes in position to
which we may subject the body, the propositions of Euclidean geometry
then resolve themselves into propositions on the possible relative
position of practically rigid bodies. Geometry which has been
supplemented in this way is then to be treated as a branch of physics.
We can now legitimately ask as to the "truth" of geometrical
propositions interpreted in this way, since we are justified in asking
whether these propositions are satisfied for those real things we have
associated with the geometrical ideas. In less exact terms we can
express this by saying that by the "truth" of a geometrical
proposition in this sense we understand its validity for a
construction with rule and compasses.

Of course the conviction of the "truth" of geometrical propositions in
this sense is founded exclusively on rather incomplete experience. For
the present we shall assume the "truth" of the geometrical
propositions, then at a later stage in the general theory of
relativity we shall see that this "truth" is limited, and we shall
consider the extent of its limitation.


  Notes

 It follows that a natural object is associated also with a
straight line. Three points A, B and C on a rigid body thus lie in a
straight line when the points A and C being given, B is chosen such
that the sum of the distances AB and BC is as short as possible. This
incomplete suggestion will suffice for the present purpose.



THE SYSTEM OF COORDINATES


On the basis of the physical interpretation of distance which has been
indicated, we are also in a position to establish the distance between
two points on a rigid body by means of measurements. For this purpose
we require a " distance " rod S which is to be used once and for
all, and which we employ as a standard measure. If, now, A and B are
two points on a rigid body, we can construct the line joining them
according to the rules of geometry  then, starting from A, we can
mark off the distance S time after time until we reach B. The number
of these operations required is the numerical measure of the distance
AB. This is the basis of all measurement of length. 

Every description of the scene of an event or of the position of an
object in space is based on the specification of the point on a rigid
body body of reference with which that event or object coincides.
This applies not only to scientific description, but also to everyday
life. If I analyse the place specification " Times Square, New York,"
A I arrive at the following result. The earth is the rigid body
to which the specification of place refers " Times Square, New York,"
is a welldefined point, to which a name has been assigned, and with
which the event coincides in space.B

This primitive method of place specification deals only with places on
the surface of rigid bodies, and is dependent on the existence of
points on this surface which are distinguishable from each other. But
we can free ourselves from both of these limitations without altering
the nature of our specification of position. If, for instance, a cloud
is hovering over Times Square, then we can determine its position
relative to the surface of the earth by erecting a pole
perpendicularly on the Square, so that it reaches the cloud. The
length of the pole measured with the standard measuringrod, combined
with the specification of the position of the foot of the pole,
supplies us with a complete place specification. On the basis of this
illustration, we are able to see the manner in which a refinement of
the conception of position has been developed.

a We imagine the rigid body, to which the place specification is
referred, supplemented in such a manner that the object whose position
we require is reached by. the completed rigid body.

b In locating the position of the object, we make use of a number
here the length of the pole measured with the measuringrod instead
of designated points of reference.

c We speak of the height of the cloud even when the pole which
reaches the cloud has not been erected. By means of optical
observations of the cloud from different positions on the ground, and
taking into account the properties of the propagation of light, we
determine the length of the pole we should have required in order to
reach the cloud.

From this consideration we see that it will be advantageous if, in the
description of position, it should be possible by means of numerical
measures to make ourselves independent of the existence of marked
positions possessing names on the rigid body of reference. In the
physics of measurement this is attained by the application of the
Cartesian system of coordinates.

This consists of three plane surfaces perpendicular to each other and
rigidly attached to a rigid body. Referred to a system of
coordinates, the scene of any event will be determined for the main
part by the specification of the lengths of the three perpendiculars
or coordinates x, y, z which can be dropped from the scene of the
event to those three plane surfaces. The lengths of these three
perpendiculars can be determined by a series of manipulations with
rigid measuringrods performed according to the rules and methods laid
down by Euclidean geometry.

In practice, the rigid surfaces which constitute the system of
coordinates are generally not available  furthermore, the magnitudes
of the coordinates are not actually determined by constructions with
rigid rods, but by indirect means. If the results of physics and
astronomy are to maintain their clearness, the physical meaning of
specifications of position must always be sought in accordance with
the above considerations. 

We thus obtain the following result Every description of events in
space involves the use of a rigid body to which such events have to be
referred. The resulting relationship takes for granted that the laws
of Euclidean geometry hold for "distances" the "distance" being
represented physically by means of the convention of two marks on a
rigid body.


  Notes

 Here we have assumed that there is nothing left over i.e. that
the measurement gives a whole number. This difficulty is got over by
the use of divided measuringrods, the introduction of which does not
demand any fundamentally new method.

A Einstein used "Potsdamer Platz, Berlin" in the original text.
In the authorised translation this was supplemented with "Tranfalgar
Square, London". We have changed this to "Times Square, New York", as
this is the most well knownidentifiable location to English speakers
in the present day. Note by the janitor.

B It is not necessary here to investigate further the significance
of the expression "coincidence in space." This conception is
sufficiently obvious to ensure that differences of opinion are
scarcely likely to arise as to its applicability in practice.

 A refinement and modification of these views does not become
necessary until we come to deal with the general theory of relativity,
treated in the second part of this book.



SPACE AND TIME IN CLASSICAL MECHANICS


The purpose of mechanics is to describe how bodies change their
position in space with "time." I should load my conscience with grave
sins against the sacred spirit of lucidity were I to formulate the
aims of mechanics in this way, without serious reflection and detailed
explanations. Let us proceed to disclose these sins.

It is not clear what is to be understood here by "position" and
"space." I stand at the window of a railway carriage which is
travelling uniformly, and drop a stone on the embankment, without
throwing it. Then, disregarding the influence of the air resistance, I
see the stone descend in a straight line. A pedestrian who observes
the misdeed from the footpath notices that the stone falls to earth in
a parabolic curve. I now ask Do the "positions" traversed by the
stone lie "in reality" on a straight line or on a parabola? Moreover,
what is meant here by motion "in space" ? From the considerations of
the previous section the answer is selfevident. In the first place we
entirely shun the vague word "space," of which, we must honestly
acknowledge, we cannot form the slightest conception, and we replace
it by "motion relative to a practically rigid body of reference." The
positions relative to the body of reference railway carriage or
embankment have already been defined in detail in the preceding
section. If instead of " body of reference " we insert " system of
coordinates," which is a useful idea for mathematical description, we
are in a position to say  The stone traverses a straight line
relative to a system of coordinates rigidly attached to the carriage,
but relative to a system of coordinates rigidly attached to the
ground embankment it describes a parabola. With the aid of this
example it is clearly seen that there is no such thing as an
independently existing trajectory lit. "pathcurve", but only
a trajectory relative to a particular body of reference.

In order to have a complete description of the motion, we must specify
how the body alters its position with time  i.e. for every point on
the trajectory it must be stated at what time the body is situated
there. These data must be supplemented by such a definition of time
that, in virtue of this definition, these timevalues can be regarded
essentially as magnitudes results of measurements capable of
observation. If we take our stand on the ground of classical
mechanics, we can satisfy this requirement for our illustration in the
following manner. We imagine two clocks of identical construction 
the man at the railwaycarriage window is holding one of them, and the
man on the footpath the other. Each of the observers determines the
position on his own referencebody occupied by the stone at each tick
of the clock he is holding in his hand. In this connection we have not
taken account of the inaccuracy involved by the finiteness of the
velocity of propagation of light. With this and with a second
difficulty prevailing here we shall have to deal in detail later.


  Notes

 That is, a curve along which the body moves.



THE GALILEIAN SYSTEM OF COORDINATES


As is well known, the fundamental law of the mechanics of
GalileiNewton, which is known as the law of inertia, can be stated
thus A body removed sufficiently far from other bodies continues in a
state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line. This law not
only says something about the motion of the bodies, but it also
indicates the referencebodies or systems of coordinates, permissible
in mechanics, which can be used in mechanical description. The visible
fixed stars are bodies for which the law of inertia certainly holds to
a high degree of approximation. Now if we use a system of coordinates
which is rigidly attached to the earth, then, relative to this system,
every fixed star describes a circle of immense radius in the course of
an astronomical day, a result which is opposed to the statement of the
law of inertia. So that if we adhere to this law we must refer these
motions only to systems of coordinates relative to which the fixed
stars do not move in a circle. A system of coordinates of which the
state of motion is such that the law of inertia holds relative to it
is called a " Galileian system of coordinates." The laws of the
mechanics of GalfleiNewton can be regarded as valid only for a
Galileian system of coordinates.



THE PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY
IN THE RESTRICTED SENSE


In order to attain the greatest possible clearness, let us return to
our example of the railway carriage supposed to be travelling
uniformly. We call its motion a uniform translation "uniform" because
it is of constant velocity and direction, " translation " because
although the carriage changes its position relative to the embankment
yet it does not rotate in so doing. Let us imagine a raven flying
through the air in such a manner that its motion, as observed from the
embankment, is uniform and in a straight line. If we were to observe
the flying raven from the moving railway carriage. we should find that
the motion of the raven would be one of different velocity and
direction, but that it would still be uniform and in a straight line.
Expressed in an abstract manner we may say  If a mass m is moving
uniformly in a straight line with respect to a coordinate system K,
then it will also be moving uniformly and in a straight line relative
to a second coordinate system K1 provided that the latter is
executing a uniform translatory motion with respect to K. In
accordance with the discussion contained in the preceding section, it
follows that

If K is a Galileian coordinate system. then every other coordinate
system K is a Galileian one, when, in relation to K, it is in a
condition of uniform motion of translation. Relative to K1 the
mechanical laws of GalileiNewton hold good exactly as they do with
respect to K.

We advance a step farther in our generalisation when we express the
tenet thus If, relative to K, K1 is a uniformly moving coordinate
system devoid of rotation, then natural phenomena run their course
with respect to K1 according to exactly the same general laws as with
respect to K. This statement is called the principle of relativity in
the restricted sense.

As long as one was convinced that all natural phenomena were capable
of representation with the help of classical mechanics, there was no
need to doubt the validity of this principle of relativity. But in
view of the more recent development of electrodynamics and optics it
became more and more evident that classical mechanics affords an
insufficient foundation for the physical description of all natural
phenomena. At this juncture the question of the validity of the
principle of relativity became ripe for discussion, and it did not
appear impossible that the answer to this question might be in the
negative.

Nevertheless, there are two general facts which at the outset speak
very much in favour of the validity of the principle of relativity.
Even though classical mechanics does not supply us with a sufficiently
broad basis for the theoretical presentation of all physical
phenomena, still we must grant it a considerable measure of " truth,"
since it supplies us with the actual motions of the heavenly bodies
with a delicacy of detail little short of wonderful. The principle of
relativity must therefore apply with great accuracy in the domain of
mechanics. But that a principle of such broad generality should hold
with such exactness in one domain of phenomena, and yet should be
invalid for another, is a priori not very probable.

We now proceed to the second argument, to which, moreover, we shall
return later. If the principle of relativity in the restricted sense
does not hold, then the Galileian coordinate systems K, K1, K2, etc.,
which are moving uniformly relative to each other, will not be
equivalent for the description of natural phenomena. In this case we
should be constrained to believe that natural laws are capable of
being formulated in a particularly simple manner, and of course only
on condition that, from amongst all possible Galileian coordinate
systems, we should have chosen one K0 of a particular state of
motion as our body of reference. We should then be justified because
of its merits for the description of natural phenomena in calling
this system " absolutely at rest," and all other Galileian systems K "
in motion." If, for instance, our embankment were the system K0 then
our railway carriage would be a system K, relative to which less
simple laws would hold than with respect to K0. This diminished
simplicity would be due to the fact that the carriage K would be in
motion i.e."really"with respect to K0. In the general laws of
nature which have been formulated with reference to K, the magnitude
and direction of the velocity of the carriage would necessarily play a
part. We should expect, for instance, that the note emitted by an
organpipe placed with its axis parallel to the direction of travel
would be different from that emitted if the axis of the pipe were
placed perpendicular to this direction.

Now in virtue of its motion in an orbit round the sun, our earth is
comparable with a railway carriage travelling with a velocity of about
30 kilometres per second. If the principle of relativity were not
valid we should therefore expect that the direction of motion of the
earth at any moment would enter into the laws of nature, and also that
physical systems in their behaviour would be dependent on the
orientation in space with respect to the earth. For owing to the
alteration in direction of the velocity of revolution of the earth in
the course of a year, the earth cannot be at rest relative to the
hypothetical system K0 throughout the whole year. However, the most
careful observations have never revealed such anisotropic properties
in terrestrial physical space, i.e. a physical nonequivalence of
different directions. This is very powerful argument in favour of the
principle of relativity.



THE THEOREM OF THE
ADDITION OF VELOCITIES
EMPLOYED IN CLASSICAL MECHANICS


Let us suppose our old friend the railway carriage to be travelling
along the rails with a constant velocity v, and that a man traverses
the length of the carriage in the direction of travel with a velocity
w. How quickly or, in other words, with what velocity W does the man
advance relative to the embankment during the process ? The only
possible answer seems to result from the following consideration If
the man were to stand still for a second, he would advance relative to
the embankment through a distance v equal numerically to the velocity
of the carriage. As a consequence of his walking, however, he
traverses an additional distance w relative to the carriage, and hence
also relative to the embankment, in this second, the distance w being
numerically equal to the velocity with which he is walking. Thus in
total be covers the distance Wvw relative to the embankment in the
second considered. We shall see later that this result, which
expresses the theorem of the addition of velocities employed in
classical mechanics, cannot be maintained  in other words, the law
that we have just written down does not hold in reality. For the time
being, however, we shall assume its correctness.



THE APPARENT INCOMPATIBILITY OF THE
LAW OF PROPAGATION OF LIGHT WITH THE
PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY


There is hardly a simpler law in physics than that according to which
light is propagated in empty space. Every child at school knows, or
believes he knows, that this propagation takes place in straight lines
with a velocity c 300,000 km.sec. At all events we know with great
exactness that this velocity is the same for all colours, because if
this were not the case, the minimum of emission would not be observed
simultaneously for different colours during the eclipse of a fixed
star by its dark neighbour. By means of similar considerations based
on observa tions of double stars, the Dutch astronomer De Sitter was
also able to show that the velocity of propagation of light cannot
depend on the velocity of motion of the body emitting the light. The
assumption that this velocity of propagation is dependent on the
direction "in space" is in itself improbable.

In short, let us assume that the simple law of the constancy of the
velocity of light c in vacuum is justifiably believed by the child
at school. Who would imagine that this simple law has plunged the
conscientiously thoughtful physicist into the greatest intellectual
difficulties? Let us consider how these difficulties arise.

Of course we must refer the process of the propagation of light and
indeed every other process to a rigid referencebody coordinate
system. As such a system let us again choose our embankment. We shall
imagine the air above it to have been removed. If a ray of light be
sent along the embankment, we see from the above that the tip of the
ray will be transmitted with the velocity c relative to the
embankment. Now let us suppose that our railway carriage is again
travelling along the railway lines with the velocity v, and that its
direction is the same as that of the ray of light, but its velocity of
course much less. Let us inquire about the velocity of propagation of
the ray of light relative to the carriage. It is obvious that we can
here apply the consideration of the previous section, since the ray of
light plays the part of the man walking along relatively to the
carriage. The velocity w of the man relative to the embankment is here
replaced by the velocity of light relative to the embankment. w is the
required velocity of light with respect to the carriage, and we have

                               w  cv.

The velocity of propagation ot a ray of light relative to the carriage
thus comes cut smaller than c.

But this result comes into conflict with the principle of relativity
set forth in Section V. For, like every other general law of
nature, the law of the transmission of light in vacuo in vacuum
must, according to the principle of relativity, be the same for the
railway carriage as referencebody as when the rails are the body of
reference. But, from our above consideration, this would appear to be
impossible. If every ray of light is propagated relative to the
embankment with the velocity c, then for this reason it would appear
that another law of propagation of light must necessarily hold with
respect to the carriage  a result contradictory to the principle of
relativity.

In view of this dilemma there appears to be nothing else for it than
to abandon either the principle of relativity or the simple law of the
propagation of light in vacuo. Those of you who have carefully
followed the preceding discussion are almost sure to expect that we
should retain the principle of relativity, which appeals so
convincingly to the intellect because it is so natural and simple. The
law of the propagation of light in vacuo would then have to be
replaced by a more complicated law conformable to the principle of
relativity. The development of theoretical physics shows, however,
that we cannot pursue this course. The epochmaking theoretical
investigations of H. A. Lorentz on the electrodynamical and optical
phenomena connected with moving bodies show that experience in this
domain leads conclusively to a theory of electromagnetic phenomena, of
which the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo is a
necessary consequence. Prominent theoretical physicists were theref
ore more inclined to reject the principle of relativity, in spite of
the fact that no empirical data had been found which were
contradictory to this principle.

At this juncture the theory of relativity entered the arena. As a
result of an analysis of the physical conceptions of time and space,
it became evident that in realily there is not the least
incompatibilitiy between the principle of relativity and the law of
propagation of light, and that by systematically holding fast to both
these laws a logically rigid theory could be arrived at. This theory
has been called the special theory of relativity to distinguish it
from the extended theory, with which we shall deal later. In the
following pages we shall present the fundamental ideas of the special
theory of relativity.



ON THE IDEA OF TIME IN PHYSICS


Lightning has struck the rails on our railway embankment at two places
A and B far distant from each other. I make the additional assertion
that these two lightning flashes occurred simultaneously. If I ask you
whether there is sense in this statement, you will answer my question
with a decided "Yes." But if I now approach you with the request to
explain to me the sense of the statement more precisely, you find
after some consideration that the answer to this question is not so
easy as it appears at first sight.

After some time perhaps the following answer would occur to you "The
significance of the statement is clear in itself and needs no further
explanation of course it would require some consideration if I were
to be commissioned to determine by observations whether in the actual
case the two events took place simultaneously or not." I cannot be
satisfied with this answer for the following reason. Supposing that as
a result of ingenious considerations an able meteorologist were to
discover that the lightning must always strike the places A and B
simultaneously, then we should be faced with the task of testing
whether or not this theoretical result is in accordance with the
reality. We encounter the same difficulty with all physical statements
in which the conception " simultaneous " plays a part. The concept
does not exist for the physicist until he has the possibility of
discovering whether or not it is fulfilled in an actual case. We thus
require a definition of simultaneity such that this definition
supplies us with the method by means of which, in the present case, he
can decide by experiment whether or not both the lightning strokes
occurred simultaneously. As long as this requirement is not satisfied,
I allow myself to be deceived as a physicist and of course the same
applies if I am not a physicist, when I imagine that I am able to
attach a meaning to the statement of simultaneity. I would ask the
reader not to proceed farther until he is fully convinced on this
point.

After thinking the matter over for some time you then offer the
following suggestion with which to test simultaneity. By measuring
along the rails, the connecting line AB should be measured up and an
observer placed at the midpoint M of the distance AB. This observer
should be supplied with an arrangement e.g. two mirrors inclined at
900 which allows him visually to observe both places A and B at the
same time. If the observer perceives the two flashes of lightning at
the same time, then they are simultaneous.

I am very pleased with this suggestion, but for all that I cannot
regard the matter as quite settled, because I feel constrained to
raise the following objection

"Your definition would certainly be right, if only I knew that the
light by means of which the observer at M perceives the lightning
flashes travels along the length A arrow M with the same velocity as
along the length B arrow M. But an examination of this supposition
would only be possible if we already had at our disposal the means of
measuring time. It would thus appear as though we were moving here in
a logical circle."

After further consideration you cast a somewhat disdainful glance at
me  and rightly so  and you declare

"I maintain my previous definition nevertheless, because in reality it
assumes absolutely nothing about light. There is only one demand to be
made of the definition of simultaneity, namely, that in every real
case it must supply us with an empirical decision as to whether or not
the conception that has to be defined is fulfilled. That my definition
satisfies this demand is indisputable. That light requires the same
time to traverse the path A arrow M as for the path B arrow M is in
reality neither a supposition nor a hypothesis about the physical
nature of light, but a stipulation which I can make of my own freewill
in order to arrive at a definition of simultaneity."

It is clear that this definition can be used to give an exact meaning
not only to two events, but to as many events as we care to choose,
and independently of the positions of the scenes of the events with
respect to the body of reference  here the railway embankment.
We are thus led also to a definition of " time " in physics. For this
purpose we suppose that clocks of identical construction are placed at
the points A, B and C of the railway line coordinate system and
that they are set in such a manner that the positions of their
pointers are simultaneously in the above sense the same. Under these
conditions we understand by the " time " of an event the reading
position of the hands of that one of these clocks which is in the
immediate vicinity in space of the event. In this manner a
timevalue is associated with every event which is essentially capable
of observation.

This stipulation contains a further physical hypothesis, the validity
of which will hardly be doubted without empirical evidence to the
contrary. It has been assumed that all these clocks go at the same
rate if they are of identical construction. Stated more exactly When
two clocks arranged at rest in different places of a referencebody
are set in such a manner that a particular position of the pointers of
the one clock is simultaneous in the above sense with the same
position, of the pointers of the other clock, then identical "
settings " are always simultaneous in the sense of the above
definition.


  Notes

 We suppose further, that, when three events A, B and C occur in
different places in such a manner that A is simultaneous with B and B
is simultaneous with C simultaneous in the sense of the above
definition, then the criterion for the simultaneity of the pair of
events A, C is also satisfied. This assumption is a physical
hypothesis about the the of propagation of light it must certainly be
fulfilled if we are to maintain the law of the constancy of the
velocity of light in vacuo.



THE RELATIVITY OF SIMULATNEITY


Up to now our considerations have been referred to a particular body
of reference, which we have styled a " railway embankment." We suppose
a very long train travelling along the rails with the constant
velocity v and in the direction indicated in Fig 1. People travelling
in this train will with a vantage view the train as a rigid
referencebody coordinate system they regard all events in

                       Fig. 01 file fig01.gif


reference to the train. Then every event which takes place along the
line also takes place at a particular point of the train. Also the
definition of simultaneity can be given relative to the train in
exactly the same way as with respect to the embankment. As a natural
consequence, however, the following question arises 

Are two events e.g. the two strokes of lightning A and B which are
simultaneous with reference to the railway embankment also
simultaneous relatively to the train? We shall show directly that the
answer must be in the negative.

When we say that the lightning strokes A and B are simultaneous with
respect to be embankment, we mean the rays of light emitted at the
places A and B, where the lightning occurs, meet each other at the
midpoint M of the length A arrow B of the embankment. But the events
A and B also correspond to positions A and B on the train. Let M1 be
the midpoint of the distance A arrow B on the travelling train. Just
when the flashes as judged from the embankment of lightning occur,
this point M1 naturally coincides with the point M but it moves
towards the right in the diagram with the velocity v of the train. If
an observer sitting in the position M1 in the train did not possess
this velocity, then he would remain permanently at M, and the light
rays emitted by the flashes of lightning A and B would reach him
simultaneously, i.e. they would meet just where he is situated. Now in
reality considered with reference to the railway embankment he is
hastening towards the beam of light coming from B, whilst he is riding
on ahead of the beam of light coming from A. Hence the observer will
see the beam of light emitted from B earlier than he will see that
emitted from A. Observers who take the railway train as their
referencebody must therefore come to the conclusion that the
lightning flash B took place earlier than the lightning flash A. We
thus arrive at the important result

Events which are simultaneous with reference to the embankment are not
simultaneous with respect to the train, and vice versa relativity of
simultaneity. Every referencebody coordinate system has its own
particular time  unless we are told the referencebody to which the
statement of time refers, there is no meaning in a statement of the
time of an event.

Now before the advent of the theory of relativity it had always
tacitly been assumed in physics that the statement of time had an
absolute significance, i.e. that it is independent of the state of
motion of the body of reference. But we have just seen that this
assumption is incompatible with the most natural definition of
simultaneity if we discard this assumption, then the conflict between
the law of the propagation of light in vacuo and the principle of
relativity developed in Section 7 disappears.

We were led to that conflict by the considerations of Section 6,
which are now no longer tenable. In that section we concluded that the
man in the carriage, who traverses the distance w per second relative
to the carriage, traverses the same distance also with respect to the
embankment in each second of time. But, according to the foregoing
considerations, the time required by a particular occurrence with
respect to the carriage must not be considered equal to the duration
of the same occurrence as judged from the embankment as
referencebody. Hence it cannot be contended that the man in walking
travels the distance w relative to the railway line in a time which is
equal to one second as judged from the embankment.

Moreover, the considerations of Section 6 are based on yet a second
assumption, which, in the light of a strict consideration, appears to
be arbitrary, although it was always tacitly made even before the
introduction of the theory of relativity.



ON THE RELATIVITY OF THE CONCEPTION OF DISTANCE


Let us consider two particular points on the train  travelling
along the embankment with the velocity v, and inquire as to their
distance apart. We already know that it is necessary to have a body of
reference for the measurement of a distance, with respect to which
body the distance can be measured up. It is the simplest plan to use
the train itself as referencebody coordinate system. An observer
in the train measures the interval by marking off his measuringrod in
a straight line e.g. along the floor of the carriage as many times
as is necessary to take him from the one marked point to the other.
Then the number which tells us how often the rod has to be laid down
is the required distance.

It is a different matter when the distance has to be judged from the
railway line. Here the following method suggests itself. If we call
A1 and B1 the two points on the train whose distance apart is
required, then both of these points are moving with the velocity v
along the embankment. In the first place we require to determine the
points A and B of the embankment which are just being passed by the
two points A1 and B1 at a particular time t  judged from the
embankment. These points A and B of the embankment can be determined
by applying the definition of time given in Section 8. The distance
between these points A and B is then measured by repeated application
of thee measuringrod along the embankment.

A priori it is by no means certain that this last measurement will
supply us with the same result as the first. Thus the length of the
train as measured from the embankment may be different from that
obtained by measuring in the train itself. This circumstance leads us
to a second objection which must be raised against the apparently
obvious consideration of Section 6. Namely, if the man in the
carriage covers the distance w in a unit of time  measured from the
train,  then this distance  as measured from the embankment  is
not necessarily also equal to w.


  Notes

 e.g. the middle of the first and of the hundredth carriage.



THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION


The results of the last three sections show that the apparent
incompatibility of the law of propagation of light with the principle
of relativity Section 7 has been derived by means of a
consideration which borrowed two unjustifiable hypotheses from
classical mechanics these are as follows

1 The timeinterval time between two events is independent of the
condition of motion of the body of reference.

2 The spaceinterval distance between two points of a rigid body
is independent of the condition of motion of the body of reference.

If we drop these hypotheses, then the dilemma of Section 7
disappears, because the theorem of the addition of velocities derived
in Section 6 becomes invalid. The possibility presents itself that
the law of the propagation of light in vacuo may be compatible with
the principle of relativity, and the question arises How have we to
modify the considerations of Section 6 in order to remove the
apparent disagreement between these two fundamental results of
experience? This question leads to a general one. In the discussion of
Section 6 we have to do with places and times relative both to the
train and to the embankment. How are we to find the place and time of
an event in relation to the train, when we know the place and time of
the event with respect to the railway embankment ? Is there a
thinkable answer to this question of such a nature that the law of
transmission of light in vacuo does not contradict the principle of
relativity ? In other words  Can we conceive of a relation between
place and time of the individual events relative to both
referencebodies, such that every ray of light possesses the velocity
of transmission c relative to the embankment and relative to the train
? This question leads to a quite definite positive answer, and to a
perfectly definite transformation law for the spacetime magnitudes of
an event when changing over from one body of reference to another.

Before we deal with this, we shall introduce the following incidental
consideration. Up to the present we have only considered events taking
place along the embankment, which had mathematically to assume the
function of a straight line. In the manner indicated in Section 2
we can imagine this referencebody supplemented laterally and in a
vertical direction by means of a framework of rods, so that an event
which takes place anywhere can be localised with reference to this
framework. Fig. 2 Similarly, we can imagine the train travelling with
the velocity v to be continued across the whole of space, so that
every event, no matter how far off it may be, could also be localised
with respect to the second framework. Without committing any
fundamental error, we can disregard the fact that in reality these
frameworks would continually interfere with each other, owing to the
impenetrability of solid bodies. In every such framework we imagine
three surfaces perpendicular to each other marked out, and designated
as " coordinate planes " " coordinate system ". A coordinate
system K then corresponds to the embankment, and a coordinate system
K to the train. An event, wherever it may have taken place, would be
fixed in space with respect to K by the three perpendiculars x, y, z
on the coordinate planes, and with regard to time by a time value t.
Relative to K1, the same event would be fixed in respect of space and
time by corresponding values x1, y1, z1, t1, which of course are not
identical with x, y, z, t. It has already been set forth in detail how
these magnitudes are to be regarded as results of physical
measurements.

Obviously our problem can be exactly formulated in the following
manner. What are the values x1, y1, z1, t1, of an event with respect
to K1, when the magnitudes x, y, z, t, of the same event with respect
to K are given ? The relations must be so chosen that the law of the
transmission of light in vacuo is satisfied for one and the same ray
of light and of course for every ray with respect to K and K1. For
the relative orientation in space of the coordinate systems indicated
in the diagram 7Fig. 2, this problem is solved by means of the
equations 

                         eq. 1 file eq01.gif

                                y1  y
                                z1  z

                         eq. 2 file eq02.gif

This system of equations is known as the " Lorentz transformation." 

If in place of the law of transmission of light we had taken as our
basis the tacit assumptions of the older mechanics as to the absolute
character of times and lengths, then instead of the above we should
have obtained the following equations

                             x1  x  vt
                                y1  y
                                z1  z
                                t1  t

This system of equations is often termed the " Galilei
transformation." The Galilei transformation can be obtained from the
Lorentz transformation by substituting an infinitely large value for
the velocity of light c in the latter transformation.

Aided by the following illustration, we can readily see that, in
accordance with the Lorentz transformation, the law of the
transmission of light in vacuo is satisfied both for the
referencebody K and for the referencebody K1. A lightsignal is sent
along the positive xaxis, and this lightstimulus advances in
accordance with the equation

                               x  ct,

i.e. with the velocity c. According to the equations of the Lorentz
transformation, this simple relation between x and t involves a
relation between x1 and t1. In point of fact, if we substitute for x
the value ct in the first and fourth equations of the Lorentz
transformation, we obtain

                         eq. 3 file eq03.gif


                         eq. 4 file eq04.gif

from which, by division, the expression

                               x1  ct1

immediately follows. If referred to the system K1, the propagation of
light takes place according to this equation. We thus see that the
velocity of transmission relative to the referencebody K1 is also
equal to c. The same result is obtained for rays of light advancing in
any other direction whatsoever. Of cause this is not surprising, since
the equations of the Lorentz transformation were derived conformably
to this point of view.


  Notes

 A simple derivation of the Lorentz transformation is given in
Appendix I.



THE BEHAVIOUR OF MEASURINGRODS AND CLOCKS IN MOTION


Place a metrerod in the x1axis of K1 in such a manner that one end
the beginning coincides with the point x10 whilst the other end
the end of the rod coincides with the point x1I. What is the length
of the metrerod relatively to the system K? In order to learn this,
we need only ask where the beginning of the rod and the end of the rod
lie with respect to K at a particular time t of the system K. By means
of the first equation of the Lorentz transformation the values of
these two points at the time t  0 can be shown to be

                       eq. 05a file eq05a.gif


                       eq. 05b file eq05b.gif


the distance between the points being eq. 06 .

But the metrerod is moving with the velocity v relative to K. It
therefore follows that the length of a rigid metrerod moving in the
direction of its length with a velocity v is eq. 06 of a metre.

The rigid rod is thus shorter when in motion than when at rest, and
the more quickly it is moving, the shorter is the rod. For the
velocity vc we should have eq. 06a ,

and for stiII greater velocities the squareroot becomes imaginary.
From this we conclude that in the theory of relativity the velocity c
plays the part of a limiting velocity, which can neither be reached
nor exceeded by any real body.

Of course this feature of the velocity c as a limiting velocity also
clearly follows from the equations of the Lorentz transformation, for
these became meaningless if we choose values of v greater than c.

If, on the contrary, we had considered a metrerod at rest in the
xaxis with respect to K, then we should have found that the length of
the rod as judged from K1 would have been eq. 06 

this is quite in accordance with the principle of relativity which
forms the basis of our considerations.

A Priori it is quite clear that we must be able to learn something
about the physical behaviour of measuringrods and clocks from the
equations of transformation, for the magnitudes z, y, x, t, are
nothing more nor less than the results of measurements obtainable by
means of measuringrods and clocks. If we had based our considerations
on the Galileian transformation we should not have obtained a
contraction of the rod as a consequence of its motion.

Let us now consider a secondsclock which is permanently situated at
the origin x10 of K1. t10 and t1I are two successive ticks of
this clock. The first and fourth equations of the Lorentz
transformation give for these two ticks 

                                t  0

and

                        eq. 07 file eq07.gif

As judged from K, the clock is moving with the velocity v as judged
from this referencebody, the time which elapses between two strokes
of the clock is not one second, but

                        eq. 08 file eq08.gif

seconds, i.e. a somewhat larger time. As a consequence of its motion
the clock goes more slowly than when at rest. Here also the velocity c
plays the part of an unattainable limiting velocity.



THEOREM OF THE ADDITION OF VELOCITIES.
THE EXPERIMENT OF FIZEAU


Now in practice we can move clocks and measuringrods only with
velocities that are small compared with the velocity of light hence
we shall hardly be able to compare the results of the previous section
directly with the reality. But, on the other hand, these results must
strike you as being very singular, and for that reason I shall now
draw another conclusion from the theory, one which can easily be
derived from the foregoing considerations, and which has been most
elegantly confirmed by experiment.

In Section 6 we derived the theorem of the addition of velocities
in one direction in the form which also results from the hypotheses of
classical mechanics This theorem can also be deduced readily horn the
Galilei transformation Section 11. In place of the man walking
inside the carriage, we introduce a point moving relatively to the
coordinate system K1 in accordance with the equation

                               x1  wt1

By means of the first and fourth equations of the Galilei
transformation we can express x1 and t1 in terms of x and t, and we
then obtain

                             x  v  wt

This equation expresses nothing else than the law of motion of the
point with reference to the system K of the man with reference to the
embankment. We denote this velocity by the symbol W, and we then
obtain, as in Section 6,

                           Wvw         A

But we can carry out this consideration just as well on the basis of
the theory of relativity. In the equation

                         x1  wt1         B

we must then express x1and t1 in terms of x and t, making use of the
first and fourth equations of the Lorentz transformation. Instead of
the equation A we then obtain the equation

                        eq. 09 file eq09.gif


which corresponds to the theorem of addition for velocities in one
direction according to the theory of relativity. The question now
arises as to which of these two theorems is the better in accord with
experience. On this point we axe enlightened by a most important
experiment which the brilliant physicist Fizeau performed more than
half a century ago, and which has been repeated since then by some of
the best experimental physicists, so that there can be no doubt about
its result. The experiment is concerned with the following question.
Light travels in a motionless liquid with a particular velocity w. How
quickly does it travel in the direction of the arrow in the tube T
see the accompanying diagram, Fig. 3 when the liquid above
mentioned is flowing through the tube with a velocity v ?

In accordance with the principle of relativity we shall certainly have
to take for granted that the propagation of light always takes place
with the same velocity w with respect to the liquid, whether the
latter is in motion with reference to other bodies or not. The
velocity of light relative to the liquid and the velocity of the
latter relative to the tube are thus known, and we require the
velocity of light relative to the tube.

It is clear that we have the problem of Section 6 again before us. The
tube plays the part of the railway embankment or of the coordinate
system K, the liquid plays the part of the carriage or of the
coordinate system K1, and finally, the light plays the part of the

                      Figure 03 file fig03.gif


man walking along the carriage, or of the moving point in the present
section. If we denote the velocity of the light relative to the tube
by W, then this is given by the equation A or B, according as the
Galilei transformation or the Lorentz transformation corresponds to
the facts. Experiment  decides in favour of equation B derived
from the theory of relativity, and the agreement is, indeed, very
exact. According to recent and most excellent measurements by Zeeman,
the influence of the velocity of flow v on the propagation of light is
represented by formula B to within one per cent.

Nevertheless we must now draw attention to the fact that a theory of
this phenomenon was given by H. A. Lorentz long before the statement
of the theory of relativity. This theory was of a purely
electrodynamical nature, and was obtained by the use of particular
hypotheses as to the electromagnetic structure of matter. This
circumstance, however, does not in the least diminish the
conclusiveness of the experiment as a crucial test in favour of the
theory of relativity, for the electrodynamics of MaxwellLorentz, on
which the original theory was based, in no way opposes the theory of
relativity. Rather has the latter been developed trom electrodynamics
as an astoundingly simple combination and generalisation of the
hypotheses, formerly independent of each other, on which
electrodynamics was built.


  Notes

 Fizeau found eq. 10 , where eq. 11

is the index of refraction of the liquid. On the other hand, owing to
the smallness of eq. 12 as compared with I,

we can replace B in the first place by eq. 13 , or to the same order
of approximation by

eq. 14 , which agrees with Fizeaus result.



THE HEURISTIC VALUE OF THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY


Our train of thought in the foregoing pages can be epitomised in the
following manner. Experience has led to the conviction that, on the
one hand, the principle of relativity holds true and that on the other
hand the velocity of transmission of light in vacuo has to be
considered equal to a constant c. By uniting these two postulates we
obtained the law of transformation for the rectangular coordinates x,
y, z and the time t of the events which constitute the processes of
nature. In this connection we did not obtain the Galilei
transformation, but, differing from classical mechanics, the Lorentz
transformation.

The law of transmission of light, the acceptance of which is justified
by our actual knowledge, played an important part in this process of
thought. Once in possession of the Lorentz transformation, however, we
can combine this with the principle of relativity, and sum up the
theory thus

Every general law of nature must be so constituted that it is
transformed into a law of exactly the same form when, instead of the
spacetime variables x, y, z, t of the original coordinate system K,
we introduce new spacetime variables x1, y1, z1, t1 of a coordinate
system K1. In this connection the relation between the ordinary and
the accented magnitudes is given by the Lorentz transformation. Or in
brief  General laws of nature are covariant with respect to Lorentz
transformations.

This is a definite mathematical condition that the theory of
relativity demands of a natural law, and in virtue of this, the theory
becomes a valuable heuristic aid in the search for general laws of
nature. If a general law of nature were to be found which did not
satisfy this condition, then at least one of the two fundamental
assumptions of the theory would have been disproved. Let us now
examine what general results the latter theory has hitherto evinced.



GENERAL RESULTS OF THE THEORY


It is clear from our previous considerations that the special theory
of relativity has grown out of electrodynamics and optics. In these
fields it has not appreciably altered the predictions of theory, but
it has considerably simplified the theoretical structure, i.e. the
derivation of laws, and  what is incomparably more important  it
has considerably reduced the number of independent hypothese forming
the basis of theory. The special theory of relativity has rendered the
MaxwellLorentz theory so plausible, that the latter would have been
generally accepted by physicists even if experiment had decided less
unequivocally in its favour.

Classical mechanics required to be modified before it could come into
line with the demands of the special theory of relativity. For the
main part, however, this modification affects only the laws for rapid
motions, in which the velocities of matter v are not very small as
compared with the velocity of light. We have experience of such rapid
motions only in the case of electrons and ions for other motions the
variations from the laws of classical mechanics are too small to make
themselves evident in practice. We shall not consider the motion of
stars until we come to speak of the general theory of relativity. In
accordance with the theory of relativity the kinetic energy of a
material point of mass m is no longer given by the wellknown
expression

                        eq. 15 file eq15.gif

but by the expression

                        eq. 16 file eq16.gif


This expression approaches infinity as the velocity v approaches the
velocity of light c. The velocity must therefore always remain less
than c, however great may be the energies used to produce the
acceleration. If we develop the expression for the kinetic energy in
the form of a series, we obtain

                        eq. 17 file eq17.gif


When eq. 18 is small compared with unity, the third of these terms is
always small in comparison with the second,

which last is alone considered in classical mechanics. The first term
mc2 does not contain the velocity, and requires no consideration if
we are only dealing with the question as to how the energy of a
pointmass depends on the velocity. We shall speak of its essential
significance later.

The most important result of a general character to which the special
theory of relativity has led is concerned with the conception of mass.
Before the advent of relativity, physics recognised two conservation
laws of fundamental importance, namely, the law of the canservation of
energy and the law of the conservation of mass these two fundamental
laws appeared to be quite independent of each other. By means of the
theory of relativity they have been united into one law. We shall now
briefly consider how this unification came about, and what meaning is
to be attached to it.

The principle of relativity requires that the law of the concervation
of energy should hold not only with reference to a coordinate system
K, but also with respect to every coordinate system K1 which is in a
state of uniform motion of translation relative to K, or, briefly,
relative to every " Galileian " system of coordinates. In contrast to
classical mechanics the Lorentz transformation is the deciding factor
in the transition from one such system to another.

By means of comparatively simple considerations we are led to draw the
following conclusion from these premises, in conjunction with the
fundamental equations of the electrodynamics of Maxwell A body moving
with the velocity v, which absorbs  an amount of energy E0 in
the form of radiation without suffering an alteration in velocity in
the process, has, as a consequence, its energy increased by an amount

                        eq. 19 file eq19.gif

In consideration of the expression given above for the kinetic energy
of the body, the required energy of the body comes out to be

                        eq. 20 file eq20.gif


Thus the body has the same energy as a body of mass

                         eq.21 file eq21.gif

moving with the velocity v. Hence we can say If a body takes up an
amount of energy E0, then its inertial mass increases by an amount

                        eq. 22 file eq22.gif


the inertial mass of a body is not a constant but varies according to
the change in the energy of the body. The inertial mass of a system of
bodies can even be regarded as a measure of its energy. The law of the
conservation of the mass of a system becomes identical with the law of
the conservation of energy, and is only valid provided that the system
neither takes up nor sends out energy. Writing the expression for the
energy in the form

                        eq. 23 file eq23.gif

we see that the term mc2, which has hitherto attracted our attention,
is nothing else than the energy possessed by the body  before it
absorbed the energy E0.

A direct comparison of this relation with experiment is not possible
at the present time 1920 see  Note, p. 48, owing to the fact that
the changes in energy E0 to which we can Subject a system are not
large enough to make themselves perceptible as a change in the
inertial mass of the system.

                                eq. 22 file eq22.gif


is too small in comparison with the mass m, which was present before
the alteration of the energy. It is owing to this circumstance that
classical mechanics was able to establish successfully the
conservation of mass as a law of independent validity.

Let me add a final remark of a fundamental nature. The success of the
FaradayMaxwell interpretation of electromagnetic action at a distance
resulted in physicists becoming convinced that there are no such
things as instantaneous actions at a distance not involving an
intermediary medium of the type of Newtons law of gravitation.
According to the theory of relativity, action at a distance with the
velocity of light always takes the place of instantaneous action at a
distance or of action at a distance with an infinite velocity of
transmission. This is connected with the fact that the velocity c
plays a fundamental role in this theory. In Part II we shall see in
what way this result becomes modified in the general theory of
relativity.


  Notes

 E0 is the energy taken up, as judged from a coordinate system
moving with the body.

Note The equation E  mc2 has been thoroughly proved time and
again since this time.



EXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY


To what extent is the special theory of relativity supported by
experience?  This question is not easily answered for the reason
already mentioned in connection with the fundamental experiment of
Fizeau. The special theory of relativity has crystallised out from the
MaxwellLorentz theory of electromagnetic phenomena. Thus all facts of
experience which support the electromagnetic theory also support the
theory of relativity. As being of particular importance, I mention
here the fact that the theory of relativity enables us to predict the
effects produced on the light reaching us from the fixed stars. These
results are obtained in an exceedingly simple manner, and the effects
indicated, which are due to the relative motion of the earth with
reference to those fixed stars are found to be in accord with
experience. We refer to the yearly movement of the apparent position
of the fixed stars resulting from the motion of the earth round the
sun aberration, and to the influence of the radial components of the
relative motions of the fixed stars with respect to the earth on the
colour of the light reaching us from them. The latter effect manifests
itself in a slight displacement of the spectral lines of the light
transmitted to us from a fixed star, as compared with the position of
the same spectral lines when they are produced by a terrestrial source
of light Doppler principle. The experimental arguments in favour of
the MaxwellLorentz theory, which are at the same time arguments in
favour of the theory of relativity, are too numerous to be set forth
here. In reality they limit the theoretical possibilities to such an
extent, that no other theory than that of Maxwell and Lorentz has been
able to hold its own when tested by experience.

But there are two classes of experimental facts hitherto obtained
which can be represented in the MaxwellLorentz theory only by the
introduction of an auxiliary hypothesis, which in itself  i.e.
without making use of the theory of relativity  appears extraneous.

It is known that cathode rays and the socalled brays emitted by
radioactive substances consist of negatively electrified particles
electrons of very small inertia and large velocity. By examining the
deflection of these rays under the influence of electric and magnetic
fields, we can study the law of motion of these particles very
exactly.

In the theoretical treatment of these electrons, we are faced with the
difficulty that electrodynamic theory of itself is unable to give an
account of their nature. For since electrical masses of one sign repel
each other, the negative electrical masses constituting the electron
would necessarily be scattered under the influence of their mutual
repulsions, unless there are forces of another kind operating between
them, the nature of which has hitherto remained obscure to us.   If
we now assume that the relative distances between the electrical
masses constituting the electron remain unchanged during the motion of
the electron rigid connection in the sense of classical mechanics,
we arrive at a law of motion of the electron which does not agree with
experience. Guided by purely formal points of view, H. A. Lorentz was
the first to introduce the hypothesis that the form of the electron
experiences a contraction in the direction of motion in consequence of
that motion. the contracted length being proportional to the
expression

                        eq. 05 file eq05.gif

This, hypothesis, which is not justifiable by any electrodynamical
facts, supplies us then with that particular law of motion which has
been confirmed with great precision in recent years.

The theory of relativity leads to the same law of motion, without
requiring any special hypothesis whatsoever as to the structure and
the behaviour of the electron. We arrived at a similar conclusion in
Section 13 in connection with the experiment of Fizeau, the result
of which is foretold by the theory of relativity without the necessity
of drawing on hypotheses as to the physical nature of the liquid.

The second class of facts to which we have alluded has reference to
the question whether or not the motion of the earth in space can be
made perceptible in terrestrial experiments. We have already remarked
in Section 5 that all attempts of this nature led to a negative
result. Before the theory of relativity was put forward, it was
difficult to become reconciled to this negative result, for reasons
now to be discussed. The inherited prejudices about time and space did
not allow any doubt to arise as to the prime importance of the
Galileian transformation for changing over from one body of reference
to another. Now assuming that the MaxwellLorentz equations hold for a
referencebody K, we then find that they do not hold for a
referencebody K1 moving uniformly with respect to K, if we assume
that the relations of the Galileian transformstion exist between the
coordinates of K and K1. It thus appears that, of all Galileian
coordinate systems, one K corresponding to a particular state of
motion is physically unique. This result was interpreted physically by
regarding K as at rest with respect to a hypothetical æther of space.
On the other hand, all coordinate systems K1 moving relatively to K
were to be regarded as in motion with respect to the æther. To this
motion of K1 against the æther "ætherdrift " relative to K1 were
attributed the more complicated laws which were supposed to hold
relative to K1. Strictly speaking, such an ætherdrift ought also to
be assumed relative to the earth, and for a long time the efforts of
physicists were devoted to attempts to detect the existence of an
ætherdrift at the earths surface.

In one of the most notable of these attempts Michelson devised a
method which appears as though it must be decisive. Imagine two
mirrors so arranged on a rigid body that the reflecting surfaces face
each other. A ray of light requires a perfectly definite time T to
pass from one mirror to the other and back again, if the whole system
be at rest with respect to the æther. It is found by calculation,
however, that a slightly different time T1 is required for this
process, if the body, together with the mirrors, be moving relatively
to the æther. And yet another point it is shown by calculation that
for a given velocity v with reference to the æther, this time T1 is
different when the body is moving perpendicularly to the planes of the
mirrors from that resulting when the motion is parallel to these
planes. Although the estimated difference between these two times is
exceedingly small, Michelson and Morley performed an experiment
involving interference in which this difference should have been
clearly detectable. But the experiment gave a negative result  a
fact very perplexing to physicists. Lorentz and FitzGerald rescued the
theory from this difficulty by assuming that the motion of the body
relative to the æther produces a contraction of the body in the
direction of motion, the amount of contraction being just sufficient
to compensate for the differeace in time mentioned above. Comparison
with the discussion in Section 11 shows that also from the
standpoint of the theory of relativity this solution of the difficulty
was the right one. But on the basis of the theory of relativity the
method of interpretation is incomparably more satisfactory. According
to this theory there is no such thing as a " specially favoured "
unique coordinate system to occasion the introduction of the
ætheridea, and hence there can be no ætherdrift, nor any experiment
with which to demonstrate it. Here the contraction of moving bodies
follows from the two fundamental principles of the theory, without the
introduction of particular hypotheses  and as the prime factor
involved in this contraction we find, not the motion in itself, to
which we cannot attach any meaning, but the motion with respect to the
body of reference chosen in the particular case in point. Thus for a
coordinate system moving with the earth the mirror system of
Michelson and Morley is not shortened, but it is shortened for a
coordinate system which is at rest relatively to the sun.


  Notes

 The general theory of relativity renders it likely that the
electrical masses of an electron are held together by gravitational
forces.



MINKOWSKIS FOURDIMENSIONAL SPACE


The nonmathematician is seized by a mysterious shuddering when he
hears of "fourdimensional" things, by a feeling not unlike that
awakened by thoughts of the occult. And yet there is no more
commonplace statement than that the world in which we live is a
fourdimensional spacetime continuum.

Space is a threedimensional continuum. By this we mean that it is
possible to describe the position of a point at rest by means of
three numbers coordinales x, y, z, and that there is an indefinite
number of points in the neighbourhood of this one, the position of
which can be described by coordinates such as x1, y1, z1, which
may be as near as we choose to the respective values of the
coordinates x, y, z, of the first point. In virtue of the latter
property we speak of a " continuum," and owing to the fact that there
are three coordinates we speak of it as being " threedimensional."

Similarly, the world of physical phenomena which was briefly called "
world " by Minkowski is naturally four dimensional in the spacetime
sense. For it is composed of individual events, each of which is
described by four numbers, namely, three space coordinates x, y, z,
and a time coordinate, the time value t. The" world" is in this sense
also a continuum for to every event there are as many "neighbouring"
events realised or at least thinkable as we care to choose, the
coordinates x1, y1, z1, t1 of which differ by an indefinitely
small amount from those of the event x, y, z, t originally considered.
That we have not been accustomed to regard the world in this sense as
a fourdimensional continuum is due to the fact that in physics,
before the advent of the theory of relativity, time played a different
and more independent role, as compared with the space coordinates. It
is for this reason that we have been in the habit of treating time as
an independent continuum. As a matter of fact, according to classical
mechanics, time is absolute, i.e. it is independent of the position
and the condition of motion of the system of coordinates. We see this
expressed in the last equation of the Galileian transformation t1 
t

The fourdimensional mode of consideration of the "world" is natural
on the theory of relativity, since according to this theory time is
robbed of its independence. This is shown by the fourth equation of
the Lorentz transformation

                        eq. 24 file eq24.gif


Moreover, according to this equation the time difference Dt1 of two
events with respect to K1 does not in general vanish, even when the
time difference Dt1 of the same events with reference to K vanishes.
Pure " spacedistance " of two events with respect to K results in "
timedistance " of the same events with respect to K. But the
discovery of Minkowski, which was of importance for the formal
development of the theory of relativity, does not lie here. It is to
be found rather in the fact of his recognition that the
fourdimensional spacetime continuum of the theory of relativity, in
its most essential formal properties, shows a pronounced relationship
to the threedimensional continuum of Euclidean geometrical
space.  In order to give due prominence to this relationship,
however, we must replace the usual time coordinate t by an imaginary
magnitude eq. 25 proportional to it. Under these conditions, the
natural laws satisfying the demands of the special theory of
relativity assume mathematical forms, in which the time coordinate
plays exactly the same role as the three space coordinates. Formally,
these four coordinates correspond exactly to the three space
coordinates in Euclidean geometry. It must be clear even to the
nonmathematician that, as a consequence of this purely formal
addition to our knowledge, the theory perforce gained clearness in no
mean measure.

These inadequate remarks can give the reader only a vague notion of
the important idea contributed by Minkowski. Without it the general
theory of relativity, of which the fundamental ideas are developed in
the following pages, would perhaps have got no farther than its long
clothes. Minkowskis work is doubtless difficult of access to anyone
inexperienced in mathematics, but since it is not necessary to have a
very exact grasp of this work in order to understand the fundamental
ideas of either the special or the general theory of relativity, I
shall leave it here at present, and revert to it only towards the end
of Part 2.

PART II

THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY


SPECIAL AND GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY


The basal principle, which was the pivot of all our previous
considerations, was the special principle of relativity, i.e. the
principle of the physical relativity of all uniform motion. Let as
once more analyse its meaning carefully.

It was at all times clear that, from the point of view of the idea it
conveys to us, every motion must be considered only as a relative
motion. Returning to the illustration we have frequently used of the
embankment and the railway carriage, we can express the fact of the
motion here taking place in the following two forms, both of which are
equally justifiable 

a The carriage is in motion relative to the embankment,
b The embankment is in motion relative to the carriage.

In a the embankment, in b the carriage, serves as the body of
reference in our statement of the motion taking place. If it is simply
a question of detecting or of describing the motion involved, it is in
principle immaterial to what referencebody we refer the motion. As
already mentioned, this is selfevident, but it must not be confused
with the much more comprehensive statement called "the principle of
relativity," which we have taken as the basis of our investigations.

The principle we have made use of not only maintains that we may
equally well choose the carriage or the embankment as our
referencebody for the description of any event for this, too, is
selfevident. Our principle rather asserts what follows  If we
formulate the general laws of nature as they are obtained from
experience, by making use of

a the embankment as referencebody,
b the railway carriage as referencebody,

then these general laws of nature e.g. the laws of mechanics or the
law of the propagation of light in vacuo have exactly the same form
in both cases. This can also be expressed as follows  For the
physical description of natural processes, neither of the reference
bodies K, K1 is unique lit. " specially marked out " as compared
with the other. Unlike the first, this latter statement need not of
necessity hold a priori it is not contained in the conceptions of "
motion" and " referencebody " and derivable from them only
experience can decide as to its correctness or incorrectness.

Up to the present, however, we have by no means maintained the
equivalence of all bodies of reference K in connection with the
formulation of natural laws. Our course was more on the following
Iines. In the first place, we started out from the assumption that
there exists a referencebody K, whose condition of motion is such
that the Galileian law holds with respect to it  A particle left to
itself and sufficiently far removed from all other particles moves
uniformly in a straight line. With reference to K Galileian
referencebody the laws of nature were to be as simple as possible.
But in addition to K, all bodies of reference K1 should be given
preference in this sense, and they should be exactly equivalent to K
for the formulation of natural laws, provided that they are in a state
of uniform rectilinear and nonrotary motion with respect to K  all
these bodies of reference are to be regarded as Galileian
referencebodies. The validity of the principle of relativity was
assumed only for these referencebodies, but not for others e.g.
those possessing motion of a different kind. In this sense we speak
of the special principle of relativity, or special theory of
relativity.

In contrast to this we wish to understand by the "general principle of
relativity" the following statement  All bodies of reference K, K1,
etc., are equivalent for the description of natural phenomena
formulation of the general laws of nature, whatever may be their
state of motion. But before proceeding farther, it ought to be pointed
out that this formulation must be replaced later by a more abstract
one, for reasons which will become evident at a later stage.

Since the introduction of the special principle of relativity has been
justified, every intellect which strives after generalisation must
feel the temptation to venture the step towards the general principle
of relativity. But a simple and apparently quite reliable
consideration seems to suggest that, for the present at any rate,
there is little hope of success in such an attempt Let us imagine
ourselves transferred to our old friend the railway carriage, which is
travelling at a uniform rate. As long as it is moving unifromly, the
occupant of the carriage is not sensible of its motion, and it is for
this reason that he can without reluctance interpret the facts of the
case as indicating that the carriage is at rest, but the embankment in
motion. Moreover, according to the special principle of relativity,
this interpretation is quite justified also from a physical point of
view.

If the motion of the carriage is now changed into a nonuniform
motion, as for instance by a powerful application of the brakes, then
the occupant of the carriage experiences a correspondingly powerful
jerk forwards. The retarded motion is manifested in the mechanical
behaviour of bodies relative to the person in the railway carriage.
The mechanical behaviour is different from that of the case previously
considered, and for this reason it would appear to be impossible that
the same mechanical laws hold relatively to the nonuniformly moving
carriage, as hold with reference to the carriage when at rest or in
uniform motion. At all events it is clear that the Galileian law does
not hold with respect to the nonuniformly moving carriage. Because of
this, we feel compelled at the present juncture to grant a kind of
absolute physical reality to nonuniform motion, in opposition to the
general principle of relatvity. But in what follows we shall soon see
that this conclusion cannot be maintained.



THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD


"If we pick up a stone and then let it go, why does it fall to the
ground ?" The usual answer to this question is "Because it is
attracted by the earth." Modern physics formulates the answer rather
differently for the following reason. As a result of the more careful
study of electromagnetic phenomena, we have come to regard action at a
distance as a process impossible without the intervention of some
intermediary medium. If, for instance, a magnet attracts a piece of
iron, we cannot be content to regard this as meaning that the magnet
acts directly on the iron through the intermediate empty space, but we
are constrained to imagine  after the manner of Faraday  that the
magnet always calls into being something physically real in the space
around it, that something being what we call a "magnetic field." In
its turn this magnetic field operates on the piece of iron, so that
the latter strives to move towards the magnet. We shall not discuss
here the justification for this incidental conception, which is indeed
a somewhat arbitrary one. We shall only mention that with its aid
electromagnetic phenomena can be theoretically represented much more
satisfactorily than without it, and this applies particularly to the
transmission of electromagnetic waves. The effects of gravitation also
are regarded in an analogous manner.

The action of the earth on the stone takes place indirectly. The earth
produces in its surrounding a gravitational field, which acts on the
stone and produces its motion of fall. As we know from experience, the
intensity of the action on a body dimishes according to a quite
definite law, as we proceed farther and farther away from the earth.
From our point of view this means  The law governing the properties
of the gravitational field in space must be a perfectly definite one,
in order correctly to represent the diminution of gravitational action
with the distance from operative bodies. It is something like this
The body e.g. the earth produces a field in its immediate
neighbourhood directly the intensity and direction of the field at
points farther removed from the body are thence determined by the law
which governs the properties in space of the gravitational fields
themselves.

In contrast to electric and magnetic fields, the gravitational field
exhibits a most remarkable property, which is of fundamental
importance for what follows. Bodies which are moving under the sole
influence of a gravitational field receive an acceleration, which does
not in the least depend either on the material or on the physical
state of the body. For instance, a piece of lead and a piece of wood
fall in exactly the same manner in a gravitational field in vacuo,
when they start off from rest or with the same initial velocity. This
law, which holds most accurately, can be expressed in a different form
in the light of the following consideration.

According to Newtons law of motion, we have

Force  inertial mass x acceleration,

where the "inertial mass" is a characteristic constant of the
accelerated body. If now gravitation is the cause of the acceleration,
we then have

Force  gravitational mass x intensity of the gravitational
field,

where the "gravitational mass" is likewise a characteristic constant
for the body. From these two relations follows

                                eq. 26 file eq26.gif


If now, as we find from experience, the acceleration is to be
independent of the nature and the condition of the body and always the
same for a given gravitational field, then the ratio of the
gravitational to the inertial mass must likewise be the same for all
bodies. By a suitable choice of units we can thus make this ratio
equal to unity. We then have the following law The gravitational mass
of a body is equal to its inertial law.

It is true that this important law had hitherto been recorded in
mechanics, but it had not been interpreted. A satisfactory
interpretation can be obtained only if we recognise the following fact
 The same quality of a body manifests itself according to
circumstances as " inertia " or as " weight " lit. " heaviness . In
the following section we shall show to what extent this is actually
the case, and how this question is connected with the general
postulate of relativity.




THE EQUALITY OF INERTIAL AND GRAVITATIONAL MASS
AS AN ARGUMENT FOR THE GENERAL POSTULE OF RELATIVITY


We imagine a large portion of empty space, so far removed from stars
and other appreciable masses, that we have before us approximately the
conditions required by the fundamental law of Galilei. It is then
possible to choose a Galileian referencebody for this part of space
world, relative to which points at rest remain at rest and points in
motion continue permanently in uniform rectilinear motion. As
referencebody let us imagine a spacious chest resembling a room with
an observer inside who is equipped with apparatus. Gravitation
naturally does not exist for this observer. He must fasten himself
with strings to the floor, otherwise the slightest impact against the
floor will cause him to rise slowly towards the ceiling of the room.

To the middle of the lid of the chest is fixed externally a hook with
rope attached, and now a " being " what kind of a being is immaterial
to us begins pulling at this with a constant force. The chest
together with the observer then begin to move "upwards" with a
uniformly accelerated motion. In course of time their velocity will
reach unheardof values  provided that we are viewing all this from
another referencebody which is not being pulled with a rope.

But how does the man in the chest regard the Process ? The
acceleration of the chest will be transmitted to him by the reaction
of the floor of the chest. He must therefore take up this pressure by
means of his legs if he does not wish to be laid out full length on
the floor. He is then standing in the chest in exactly the same way as
anyone stands in a room of a home on our earth. If he releases a body
which he previously had in his land, the accelertion of the chest will
no longer be transmitted to this body, and for this reason the body
will approach the floor of the chest with an accelerated relative
motion. The observer will further convince himself that the
acceleration of the body towards the floor of the chest is always of
the same magnitude, whatever kind of body he may happen to use for the
experiment.

Relying on his knowledge of the gravitational field as it was
discussed in the preceding section, the man in the chest will thus
come to the conclusion that he and the chest are in a gravitational
field which is constant with regard to time. Of course he will be
puzzled for a moment as to why the chest does not fall in this
gravitational field. just then, however, he discovers the hook in the
middle of the lid of the chest and the rope which is attached to it,
and he consequently comes to the conclusion that the chest is
suspended at rest in the gravitational field.

Ought we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his conclusion ?
I do not believe we ought to if we wish to remain consistent  we must
rather admit that his mode of grasping the situation violates neither
reason nor known mechanical laws. Even though it is being accelerated
with respect to the "Galileian space" first considered, we can
nevertheless regard the chest as being at rest. We have thus good
grounds for extending the principle of relativity to include bodies of
reference which are accelerated with respect to each other, and as a
result we have gained a powerful argument for a generalised postulate
of relativity.

We must note carefully that the possibility of this mode of
interpretation rests on the fundamental property of the gravitational
field of giving all bodies the same acceleration, or, what comes to
the same thing, on the law of the equality of inertial and
gravitational mass. If this natural law did not exist, the man in the
accelerated chest would not be able to interpret the behaviour of the
bodies around him on the supposition of a gravitational field, and he
would not be justified on the grounds of experience in supposing his
referencebody to be " at rest."

Suppose that the man in the chest fixes a rope to the inner side of
the lid, and that he attaches a body to the free end of the rope. The
result of this will be to strech the rope so that it will hang "
vertically " downwards. If we ask for an opinion of the cause of
tension in the rope, the man in the chest will say "The suspended
body experiences a downward force in the gravitational field, and this
is neutralised by the tension of the rope  what determines the
magnitude of the tension of the rope is the gravitational mass of the
suspended body." On the other hand, an observer who is poised freely
in space will interpret the condition of things thus  " The rope must
perforce take part in the accelerated motion of the chest, and it
transmits this motion to the body attached to it. The tension of the
rope is just large enough to effect the acceleration of the body. That
which determines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is the
inertial mass of the body." Guided by this example, we see that our
extension of the principle of relativity implies the necessity of the
law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass. Thus we have
obtained a physical interpretation of this law.

From our consideration of the accelerated chest we see that a general
theory of relativity must yield important results on the laws of
gravitation. In point of fact, the systematic pursuit of the general
idea of relativity has supplied the laws satisfied by the
gravitational field. Before proceeding farther, however, I must warn
the reader against a misconception suggested by these considerations.
A gravitational field exists for the man in the chest, despite the
fact that there was no such field for the coordinate system first
chosen. Now we might easily suppose that the existence of a
gravitational field is always only an apparent one. We might also
think that, regardless of the kind of gravitational field which may be
present, we could always choose another referencebody such that no
gravitational field exists with reference to it. This is by no means
true for all gravitational fields, but only for those of quite special
form. It is, for instance, impossible to choose a body of reference
such that, as judged from it, the gravitational field of the earth in
its entirety vanishes.

We can now appreciate why that argument is not convincing, which we
brought forward against the general principle of relativity at theend
of Section 18. It is certainly true that the observer in the
railway carriage experiences a jerk forwards as a result of the
application of the brake, and that he recognises, in this the
nonuniformity of motion retardation of the carriage. But he is
compelled by nobody to refer this jerk to a " real " acceleration
retardation of the carriage. He might also interpret his experience
thus " My body of reference the carriage remains permanently at
rest. With reference to it, however, there exists during the period
of application of the brakes a gravitational field which is directed
forwards and which is variable with respect to time. Under the
influence of this field, the embankment together with the earth moves
nonuniformly in such a manner that their original velocity in the
backwards direction is continuously reduced."



IN WHAT RESPECTS ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND OF THE
SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY UNSATISFACTORY?


We have already stated several times that classical mechanics starts
out from the following law Material particles sufficiently far
removed from other material particles continue to move uniformly in a
straight line or continue in a state of rest. We have also repeatedly
emphasised that this fundamental law can only be valid for bodies of
reference K which possess certain unique states of motion, and which
are in uniform translational motion relative to each other. Relative
to other referencebodies K the law is not valid. Both in classical
mechanics and in the special theory of relativity we therefore
differentiate between referencebodies K relative to which the
recognised " laws of nature " can be said to hold, and
referencebodies K relative to which these laws do not hold.

But no person whose mode of thought is logical can rest satisfied with
this condition of things. He asks  " How does it come that certain
referencebodies or their states of motion are given priority over
other referencebodies or their states of motion ? What is the
reason for this Preference? In order to show clearly what I mean by
this question, I shall make use of a comparison.

I am standing in front of a gas range. Standing alongside of each
other on the range are two pans so much alike that one may be mistaken
for the other. Both are half full of water. I notice that steam is
being emitted continuously from the one pan, but not from the other. I
am surprised at this, even if I have never seen either a gas range or
a pan before. But if I now notice a luminous something of bluish
colour under the first pan but not under the other, I cease to be
astonished, even if I have never before seen a gas flame. For I can
only say that this bluish something will cause the emission of the
steam, or at least possibly it may do so. If, however, I notice the
bluish something in neither case, and if I observe that the one
continuously emits steam whilst the other does not, then I shall
remain astonished and dissatisfied until I have discovered some
circumstance to which I can attribute the different behaviour of the
two pans.

Analogously, I seek in vain for a real something in classical
mechanics or in the special theory of relativity to which I can
attribute the different behaviour of bodies considered with respect to
the reference systems K and K1.  Newton saw this objection and
attempted to invalidate it, but without success. But E. Mach recognsed
it most clearly of all, and because of this objection he claimed that
mechanics must be placed on a new basis. It can only be got rid of by
means of a physics which is conformable to the general principle of
relativity, since the equations of such a theory hold for every body
of reference, whatever may be its state of motion.


  Notes

 The objection is of importance more especially when the state of
motion of the referencebody is of such a nature that it does not
require any external agency for its maintenance, e.g. in the case when
the referencebody is rotating uniformly.



A FEW INFERENCES FROM THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY


The considerations of Section 20 show that the general principle of
relativity puts us in a position to derive properties of the
gravitational field in a purely theoretical manner. Let us suppose,
for instance, that we know the spacetime " course " for any natural
process whatsoever, as regards the manner in which it takes place in
the Galileian domain relative to a Galileian body of reference K. By
means of purely theoretical operations i.e. simply by calculation we
are then able to find how this known natural process appears, as seen
from a referencebody K1 which is accelerated relatively to K. But
since a gravitational field exists with respect to this new body of
reference K1, our consideration also teaches us how the gravitational
field influences the process studied.

For example, we learn that a body which is in a state of uniform
rectilinear motion with respect to K in accordance with the law of
Galilei is executing an accelerated and in general curvilinear motion
with respect to the accelerated referencebody K1 chest. This
acceleration or curvature corresponds to the influence on the moving
body of the gravitational field prevailing relatively to K. It is
known that a gravitational field influences the movement of bodies in
this way, so that our consideration supplies us with nothing
essentially new.

However, we obtain a new result of fundamental importance when we
carry out the analogous consideration for a ray of light. With respect
to the Galileian referencebody K, such a ray of light is transmitted
rectilinearly with the velocity c. It can easily be shown that the
path of the same ray of light is no longer a straight line when we
consider it with reference to the accelerated chest referencebody
K1. From this we conclude, that, in general, rays of light are
propagated curvilinearly in gravitational fields. In two respects this
result is of great importance.

In the first place, it can be compared with the reality. Although a
detailed examination of the question shows that the curvature of light
rays required by the general theory of relativity is only exceedingly
small for the gravitational fields at our disposal in practice, its
estimated magnitude for light rays passing the sun at grazing
incidence is nevertheless 1.7 seconds of arc. This ought to manifest
itself in the following way. As seen from the earth, certain fixed
stars appear to be in the neighbourhood of the sun, and are thus
capable of observation during a total eclipse of the sun. At such
times, these stars ought to appear to be displaced outwards from the
sun by an amount indicated above, as compared with their apparent
position in the sky when the sun is situated at another part of the
heavens. The examination of the correctness or otherwise of this
deduction is a problem of the greatest importance, the early solution
of which is to be expected of astronomers.2

In the second place our result shows that, according to the general
theory of relativity, the law of the constancy of the velocity of
light in vacuo, which constitutes one of the two fundamental
assumptions in the special theory of relativity and to which we have
already frequently referred, cannot claim any unlimited validity. A
curvature of rays of light can only take place when the velocity of
propagation of light varies with position. Now we might think that as
a consequence of this, the special theory of relativity and with it
the whole theory of relativity would be laid in the dust. But in
reality this is not the case. We can only conclude that the special
theory of relativity cannot claim an unlinlited domain of validity 
its results hold only so long as we are able to disregard the
influences of gravitational fields on the phenomena e.g. of light.

Since it has often been contended by opponents of the theory of
relativity that the special theory of relativity is overthrown by the
general theory of relativity, it is perhaps advisable to make the
facts of the case clearer by means of an appropriate comparison.
Before the development of electrodynamics the laws of electrostatics
were looked upon as the laws of electricity. At the present time we
know that electric fields can be derived correctly from electrostatic
considerations only for the case, which is never strictly realised, in
which the electrical masses are quite at rest relatively to each
other, and to the coordinate system. Should we be justified in saying
that for this reason electrostatics is overthrown by the
fieldequations of Maxwell in electrodynamics ? Not in the least.
Electrostatics is contained in electrodynamics as a limiting case 
the laws of the latter lead directly to those of the former for the
case in which the fields are invariable with regard to time. No fairer
destiny could be allotted to any physical theory, than that it should
of itself point out the way to the introduction of a more
comprehensive theory, in which it lives on as a limiting case.

In the example of the transmission of light just dealt with, we have
seen that the general theory of relativity enables us to derive
theoretically the influence of a gravitational field on the course of
natural processes, the Iaws of which are already known when a
gravitational field is absent. But the most attractive problem, to the
solution of which the general theory of relativity supplies the key,
concerns the investigation of the laws satisfied by the gravitational
field itself. Let us consider this for a moment.

We are acquainted with spacetime domains which behave approximately
in a " Galileian " fashion under suitable choice of referencebody,
i.e. domains in which gravitational fields are absent. If we now refer
such a domain to a referencebody K1 possessing any kind of motion,
then relative to K1 there exists a gravitational field which is
variable with respect to space and time.3  The character of this
field will of course depend on the motion chosen for K1. According to
the general theory of relativity, the general law of the gravitational
field must be satisfied for all gravitational fields obtainable in
this way. Even though by no means all gravitationial fields can be
produced in this way, yet we may entertain the hope that the general
law of gravitation will be derivable from such gravitational fields of
a special kind. This hope has been realised in the most beautiful
manner. But between the clear vision of this goal and its actual
realisation it was necessary to surmount a serious difficulty, and as
this lies deep at the root of things, I dare not withhold it from the
reader. We require to extend our ideas of the spacetime continuum
still farther.


  Notes

 By means of the star photographs of two expeditions equipped by
a Joint Committee of the Royal and Royal Astronomical Societies, the
existence of the deflection of light demanded by theory was first
confirmed during the solar eclipse of 29th May, 1919. Cf. Appendix
III.

 This follows from a generalisation of the discussion in
Section 20



BEHAVIOUR OF CLOCKS AND MEASURINGRODS ON A ROTATING BODY OF REFERENCE


Hitherto I have purposely refrained from speaking about the physical
interpretation of space and timedata in the case of the general
theory of relativity. As a consequence, I am guilty of a certain
slovenliness of treatment, which, as we know from the special theory
of relativity, is far from being unimportant and pardonable. It is now
high time that we remedy this defect but I would mention at the
outset, that this matter lays no small claims on the patience and on
the power of abstraction of the reader.

We start off again from quite special cases, which we have frequently
used before. Let us consider a space time domain in which no
gravitational field exists relative to a referencebody K whose state
of motion has been suitably chosen. K is then a Galileian
referencebody as regards the domain considered, and the results of
the special theory of relativity hold relative to K. Let us supposse
the same domain referred to a second body of reference K1, which is
rotating uniformly with respect to K. In order to fix our ideas, we
shall imagine K1 to be in the form of a plane circular disc, which
rotates uniformly in its own plane about its centre. An observer who
is sitting eccentrically on the disc K1 is sensible of a force which
acts outwards in a radial direction, and which would be interpreted as
an effect of inertia centrifugal force by an observer who was at
rest with respect to the original referencebody K. But the observer
on the disc may regard his disc as a referencebody which is " at rest
"  on the basis of the general principle of relativity he is
justified in doing this. The force acting on himself, and in fact on
all other bodies which are at rest relative to the disc, he regards as
the effect of a gravitational field. Nevertheless, the
spacedistribution of this gravitational field is of a kind that would
not be possible on Newtons theory of gravitation. But since the
observer believes in the general theory of relativity, this does not
disturb him he is quite in the right when he believes that a general
law of gravitation can be formulated a law which not only explains
the motion of the stars correctly, but also the field of force
experienced by himself.

The observer performs experiments on his circular disc with clocks and
measuringrods. In doing so, it is his intention to arrive at exact
definitions for the signification of time and spacedata with
reference to the circular disc K1, these definitions being based on
his observations. What will be his experience in this enterprise ?

To start with, he places one of two identically constructed clocks at
the centre of the circular disc, and the other on the edge of the
disc, so that they are at rest relative to it. We now ask ourselves
whether both clocks go at the same rate from the standpoint of the
nonrotating Galileian referencebody K. As judged from this body, the
clock at the centre of the disc has no velocity, whereas the clock at
the edge of the disc is in motion relative to K in consequence of the
rotation. According to a result obtained in Section 12, it follows
that the latter clock goes at a rate permanently slower than that of
the clock at the centre of the circular disc, i.e. as observed from K.
It is obvious that the same effect would be noted by an observer whom
we will imagine sitting alongside his clock at the centre of the
circular disc. Thus on our circular disc, or, to make the case more
general, in every gravitational field, a clock will go more quickly or
less quickly, according to the position in which the clock is situated
at rest. For this reason it is not possible to obtain a reasonable
definition of time with the aid of clocks which are arranged at rest
with respect to the body of reference. A similar difficulty presents
itself when we attempt to apply our earlier definition of simultaneity
in such a case, but I do not wish to go any farther into this
question.

Moreover, at this stage the definition of the space coordinates also
presents insurmountable difficulties. If the observer applies his
standard measuringrod a rod which is short as compared with the
radius of the disc tangentially to the edge of the disc, then, as
judged from the Galileian system, the length of this rod will be less
than I, since, according to Section 12, moving bodies suffer a
shortening in the direction of the motion. On the other hand, the
measaringrod will not experience a shortening in length, as judged
from K, if it is applied to the disc in the direction of the radius.
If, then, the observer first measures the circumference of the disc
with his measuringrod and then the diameter of the disc, on dividing
the one by the other, he will not obtain as quotient the familiar
number p  3.14 . . ., but a larger number,4 whereas of course,
for a disc which is at rest with respect to K, this operation would
yield p exactly. This proves that the propositions of Euclidean
geometry cannot hold exactly on the rotating disc, nor in general in a
gravitational field, at least if we attribute the length I to the rod
in all positions and in every orientation. Hence the idea of a
straight line also loses its meaning. We are therefore not in a
position to define exactly the coordinates x, y, z relative to the
disc by means of the method used in discussing the special theory, and
as long as the co ordinates and times of events have not been
defined, we cannot assign an exact meaning to the natural laws in
which these occur.

Thus all our previous conclusions based on general relativity would
appear to be called in question. In reality we must make a subtle
detour in order to be able to apply the postulate of general
relativity exactly. I shall prepare the reader for this in the
following paragraphs.


  Notes

 The field disappears at the centre of the disc and increases
proportionally to the distance from the centre as we proceed outwards.

 Throughout this consideration we have to use the Galileian
nonrotating system K as referencebody, since we may only assume
the validity of the results of the special theory of relativity
relative to K relative to K1 a gravitational field prevails.



EUCLIDEAN AND NONEUCLIDEAN CONTINUUM


The surface of a marble table is spread out in front of me. I can get
from any one point on this table to any other point by passing
continuously from one point to a " neighbouring " one, and repeating
this process a large number of times, or, in other words, by going
from point to point without executing "jumps." I am sure the reader
will appreciate with sufficient clearness what I mean here by "
neighbouring " and by " jumps " if he is not too pedantic. We
express this property of the surface by describing the latter as a
continuum.

Let us now imagine that a large number of little rods of equal length
have been made, their lengths being small compared with the dimensions
of the marble slab. When I say they are of equal length, I mean that
one can be laid on any other without the ends overlapping. We next lay
four of these little rods on the marble slab so that they constitute a
quadrilateral figure a square, the diagonals of which are equally
long. To ensure the equality of the diagonals, we make use of a little
testingrod. To this square we add similar ones, each of which has one
rod in common with the first. We proceed in like manner with each of
these squares until finally the whole marble slab is laid out with
squares. The arrangement is such, that each side of a square belongs
to two squares and each corner to four squares.

It is a veritable wonder that we can carry out this business without
getting into the greatest difficulties. We only need to think of the
following. If at any moment three squares meet at a corner, then two
sides of the fourth square are already laid, and, as a consequence,
the arrangement of the remaining two sides of the square is already
completely determined. But I am now no longer able to adjust the
quadrilateral so that its diagonals may be equal. If they are equal of
their own accord, then this is an especial favour of the marble slab
and of the little rods, about which I can only be thankfully
surprised. We must experience many such surprises if the construction
is to be successful.

If everything has really gone smoothly, then I say that the points of
the marble slab constitute a Euclidean continuum with respect to the
little rod, which has been used as a " distance " lineinterval. By
choosing one corner of a square as " origin" I can characterise every
other corner of a square with reference to this origin by means of two
numbers. I only need state how many rods I must pass over when,
starting from the origin, I proceed towards the " right " and then "
upwards," in order to arrive at the corner of the square under
consideration. These two numbers are then the " Cartesian coordinates
" of this corner with reference to the " Cartesian coordinate system"
which is determined by the arrangement of little rods.

By making use of the following modification of this abstract
experiment, we recognise that there must also be cases in which the
experiment would be unsuccessful. We shall suppose that the rods "
expand " by in amount proportional to the increase of temperature. We
heat the central part of the marble slab, but not the periphery, in
which case two of our little rods can still be brought into
coincidence at every position on the table. But our construction of
squares must necessarily come into disorder during the heating,
because the little rods on the central region of the table expand,
whereas those on the outer part do not.

With reference to our little rods  defined as unit lengths  the
marble slab is no longer a Euclidean continuum, and we are also no
longer in the position of defining Cartesian coordinates directly
with their aid, since the above construction can no longer be carried
out. But since there are other things which are not influenced in a
similar manner to the little rods or perhaps not at all by the
temperature of the table, it is possible quite naturally to maintain
the point of view that the marble slab is a " Euclidean continuum."
This can be done in a satisfactory manner by making a more subtle
stipulation about the measurement or the comparison of lengths.

But if rods of every kind i.e. of every material were to behave in
the same way as regards the influence of temperature when they are on
the variably heated marble slab, and if we had no other means of
detecting the effect of temperature than the geometrical behaviour of
our rods in experiments analogous to the one described above, then our
best plan would be to assign the distance one to two points on the
slab, provided that the ends of one of our rods could be made to
coincide with these two points  for how else should we define the
distance without our proceeding being in the highest measure grossly
arbitrary ? The method of Cartesian coordinates must then be
discarded, and replaced by another which does not assume the validity
of Euclidean geometry for rigid bodies.  The reader will notice
that the situation depicted here corresponds to the one brought about
by the general postitlate of relativity Section 23.


  Notes

 Mathematicians have been confronted with our problem in the
following form. If we are given a surface e.g. an ellipsoid in
Euclidean threedimensional space, then there exists for this surface
a twodimensional geometry, just as much as for a plane surface. Gauss
undertook the task of treating this twodimensional geometry from
first principles, without making use of the fact that the surface
belongs to a Euclidean continuum of three dimensions. If we imagine
constructions to be made with rigid rods in the surface similar to
that above with the marble slab, we should find that different laws
hold for these from those resulting on the basis of Euclidean plane
geometry. The surface is not a Euclidean continuum with respect to the
rods, and we cannot define Cartesian coordinates in the surface.
Gauss indicated the principles according to which we can treat the
geometrical relationships in the surface, and thus pointed out the way
to the method of Riemman of treating multidimensional, nonEuclidean
continuum. Thus it is that mathematicians long ago solved the formal
problems to which we are led by the general postulate of relativity.



GAUSSIAN COORDINATES


According to Gauss, this combined analytical and geometrical mode of
handling the problem can be arrived at in the following way. We
imagine a system of arbitrary curves see Fig. 4 drawn on the surface
of the table. These we designate as ucurves, and we indicate each of
them by means of a number. The Curves u 1, u 2 and u 3 are drawn in
the diagram. Between the curves u 1 and u 2 we must imagine an
infinitely large number to be drawn, all of which correspond to real
numbers lying between 1 and 2. fig. 04 We have then a system of
ucurves, and this "infinitely dense" system covers the whole surface
of the table. These ucurves must not intersect each other, and
through each point of the surface one and only one curve must pass.
Thus a perfectly definite value of u belongs to every point on the
surface of the marble slab. In like manner we imagine a system of
vcurves drawn on the surface. These satisfy the same conditions as
the ucurves, they are provided with numbers in a corresponding
manner, and they may likewise be of arbitrary shape. It follows that a
value of u and a value of v belong to every point on the surface of
the table. We call these two numbers the coordinates of the surface
of the table Gaussian coordinates. For example, the point P in the
diagram has the Gaussian coordinates u 3, v 1. Two neighbouring
points P and P1 on the surface then correspond to the coordinates

                       P       u,v

                       P1     u  du, v  dv,

where du and dv signify very small numbers. In a similar manner we may
indicate the distance lineinterval between P and P1, as measured
with a little rod, by means of the very small number ds. Then
according to Gauss we have

                ds2  g11du2  2g12dudv  g22dv2

where g11, g12, g22, are magnitudes which depend in a perfectly
definite way on u and v. The magnitudes g11, g12 and g22,
determine the behaviour of the rods relative to the ucurves and
vcurves, and thus also relative to the surface of the table. For the
case in which the points of the surface considered form a Euclidean
continuum with reference to the measuringrods, but only in this case,
it is possible to draw the ucurves and vcurves and to attach numbers
to them, in such a manner, that we simply have 

                           ds2  du2  dv2

Under these conditions, the ucurves and vcurves are straight lines
in the sense of Euclidean geometry, and they are perpendicular to each
other. Here the Gaussian coordinates are samply Cartesian ones. It is
clear that Gauss coordinates are nothing more than an association of
two sets of numbers with the points of the surface considered, of such
a nature that numerical values differing very slightly from each other
are associated with neighbouring points " in space."

So far, these considerations hold for a continuum of two dimensions.
But the Gaussian method can be applied also to a continuum of three,
four or more dimensions. If, for instance, a continuum of four
dimensions be supposed available, we may represent it in the following
way. With every point of the continuum, we associate arbitrarily four
numbers, x1, x2, x3, x4, which are known as " coordinates."
Adjacent points correspond to adjacent values of the coordinates. If a
distance ds is associated with the adjacent points P and P1, this
distance being measurable and well defined from a physical point of
view, then the following formula holds

ds2  g11dx12  2g12dx1dx2 . . . . g44dx42,

where the magnitudes g11, etc., have values which vary with the
position in the continuum. Only when the continuum is a Euclidean one
is it possible to associate the coordinates x1 . . x4. with the
points of the continuum so that we have simply

ds2  dx12  dx22  dx32  dx42.

In this case relations hold in the fourdimensional continuum which
are analogous to those holding in our threedimensional measurements.

However, the Gauss treatment for ds2 which we have given above is not
always possible. It is only possible when sufficiently small regions
of the continuum under consideration may be regarded as Euclidean
continua. For example, this obviously holds in the case of the marble
slab of the table and local variation of temperature. The temperature
is practically constant for a small part of the slab, and thus the
geometrical behaviour of the rods is almost as it ought to be
according to the rules of Euclidean geometry. Hence the imperfections
of the construction of squares in the previous section do not show
themselves clearly until this construction is extended over a
considerable portion of the surface of the table.

We can sum this up as follows Gauss invented a method for the
mathematical treatment of continua in general, in which "
sizerelations " " distances " between neighbouring points are
defined. To every point of a continuum are assigned as many numbers
Gaussian coordinates as the continuum has dimensions. This is done
in such a way, that only one meaning can be attached to the
assignment, and that numbers Gaussian coordinates which differ by an
indefinitely small amount are assigned to adjacent points. The
Gaussian coordinate system is a logical generalisation of the
Cartesian coordinate system. It is also applicable to nonEuclidean
continua, but only when, with respect to the defined "size" or
"distance," small parts of the continuum under consideration behave
more nearly like a Euclidean system, the smaller the part of the
continuum under our notice.



THE SPACETIME CONTINUUM OF THE SPEICAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY CONSIDERED AS A
EUCLIDEAN CONTINUUM


We are now in a position to formulate more exactly the idea of
Minkowski, which was only vaguely indicated in Section 17. In
accordance with the special theory of relativity, certain coordinate
systems are given preference for the description of the
fourdimensional, spacetime continuum. We called these " Galileian
coordinate systems." For these systems, the four coordinates x, y,
z, t, which determine an event or  in other words, a point of the
fourdimensional continuum  are defined physically in a simple
manner, as set forth in detail in the first part of this book. For the
transition from one Galileian system to another, which is moving
uniformly with reference to the first, the equations of the Lorentz
transformation are valid. These last form the basis for the derivation
of deductions from the special theory of relativity, and in themselves
they are nothing more than the expression of the universal validity of
the law of transmission of light for all Galileian systems of
reference.

Minkowski found that the Lorentz transformations satisfy the following
simple conditions. Let us consider two neighbouring events, the
relative position of which in the fourdimensional continuum is given
with respect to a Galileian referencebody K by the space coordinate
differences dx, dy, dz and the timedifference dt. With reference to a
second Galileian system we shall suppose that the corresponding
differences for these two events are dx1, dy1, dz1, dt1. Then these
magnitudes always fulfil the condition

     dx2  dy2  dz2  c2dt2  dx1 2  dy1 2  dz1 2  c2dt1 2.

The validity of the Lorentz transformation follows from this
condition. We can express this as follows The magnitude

                   ds2  dx2  dy2  dz2  c2dt2,

which belongs to two adjacent points of the fourdimensional
spacetime continuum, has the same value for all selected Galileian
referencebodies. If we replace x, y, z, sq. rt. I . ct , by x1,
x2, x3, x4, we also obtaill the result that

             ds2  dx12  dx22  dx32  dx42.

is independent of the choice of the body of reference. We call the
magnitude ds the " distance " apart of the two events or
fourdimensional points.

Thus, if we choose as timevariable the imaginary variable sq. rt. I
. ct instead of the real quantity t, we can regard the spacetime
contintium  accordance with the special theory of relativity  as a
", Euclidean " fourdimensional continuum, a result which follows from
the considerations of the preceding section.

there for the coordlnates themselves are valid also for coordinate
differences, and thus also for coordinate differentials indefinitely
small differences.



THE SPACETIME CONTINUUM OF THE GENERAL THEORY OF REALTIIVTY IS NOT A
ECULIDEAN CONTINUUM


In the first part of this book we were able to make use of spacetime
coordinates which allowed of a simple and direct physical
interpretation, and which, according to Section 26, can be regarded
as fourdimensional Cartesian coordinates. This was possible on the
basis of the law of the constancy of the velocity of tight. But
according to Section 21 the general theory of relativity cannot
retain this law. On the contrary, we arrived at the result that
according to this latter theory the velocity of light must always
depend on the coordinates when a gravitational field is present. In
connection with a specific illustration in Section 23, we found
that the presence of a gravitational field invalidates the definition
of the coordinates and the ifine, which led us to our objective in the
special theory of relativity.

In view of the resuIts of these considerations we are led to the
conviction that, according to the general principle of relativity, the
spacetime continuum cannot be regarded as a Euclidean one, but that
here we have the general case, corresponding to the marble slab with
local variations of temperature, and with which we made acquaintance
as an example of a twodimensional continuum. Just as it was there
impossible to construct a Cartesian coordinate system from equal
rods, so here it is impossible to build up a system referencebody
from rigid bodies and clocks, which shall be of such a nature that
measuringrods and clocks, arranged rigidly with respect to one
another, shaIll indicate position and time directly. Such was the
essence of the difficulty with which we were confronted in Section
23.

But the considerations of Sections 25 and 26 show us the way to
surmount this difficulty. We refer the fourdimensional spacetime
continuum in an arbitrary manner to Gauss coordinates. We assign to
every point of the continuum event four numbers, x1, x2, x3,
x4 coordinates, which have not the least direct physical
significance, but only serve the purpose of numbering the points of
the continuum in a definite but arbitrary manner. This arrangement
does not even need to be of such a kind that we must regard x1,
x2, x3, as "space" coordinates and x4, as a " time "
coordinate.

The reader may think that such a description of the world would be
quite inadequate. What does it mean to assign to an event the
particular coordinates x1, x2, x3, x4, if in themselves these
coordinates have no significance ? More careful consideration shows,
however, that this anxiety is unfounded. Let us consider, for
instance, a material point with any kind of motion. If this point had
only a momentary existence without duration, then it would to
described in spacetime by a single system of values x1, x2, x3,
x4. Thus its permanent existence must be characterised by an
infinitely large number of such systems of values, the coordinate
values of which are so close together as to give continuity
corresponding to the material point, we thus have a unidimensional
line in the fourdimensional continuum. In the same way, any such
lines in our continuum correspond to many points in motion. The only
statements having regard to these points which can claim a physical
existence are in reality the statements about their encounters. In our
mathematical treatment, such an encounter is expressed in the fact
that the two lines which represent the motions of the points in
question have a particular system of coordinate values, x1, x2,
x3, x4, in common. After mature consideration the reader will
doubtless admit that in reality such encounters constitute the only
actual evidence of a timespace nature with which we meet in physical
statements.

When we were describing the motion of a material point relative to a
body of reference, we stated nothing more than the encounters of this
point with particular points of the referencebody. We can also
determine the corresponding values of the time by the observation of
encounters of the body with clocks, in conjunction with the
observation of the encounter of the hands of clocks with particular
points on the dials. It is just the same in the case of
spacemeasurements by means of measuringrods, as a litttle
consideration will show.

The following statements hold generally  Every physical description
resolves itself into a number of statements, each of which refers to
the spacetime coincidence of two events A and B. In terms of Gaussian
coordinates, every such statement is expressed by the agreement of
their four coordinates x1, x2, x3, x4. Thus in reality, the
description of the timespace continuum by means of Gauss coordinates
completely replaces the description with the aid of a body of
reference, without suffering from the defects of the latter mode of
description it is not tied down to the Euclidean character of the
continuum which has to be represented.



EXACT FORMULATION OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY


We are now in a position to replace the pro. visional formulation of
the general principle of relativity given in Section 18 by an exact
formulation. The form there used, "All bodies of reference K, K1,
etc., are equivalent for the description of natural phenomena
formulation of the general laws of nature, whatever may be their
state of motion," cannot be maintained, because the use of rigid
referencebodies, in the sense of the method followed in the special
theory of relativity, is in general not possible in spacetime
description. The Gauss coordinate system has to take the place of the
body of reference. The following statement corresponds to the
fundamental idea of the general principle of relativity "All Gaussian
coordinate systems are essentially equivalent for the formulation of
the general laws of nature."

We can state this general principle of relativity in still another
form, which renders it yet more clearly intelligible than it is when
in the form of the natural extension of the special principle of
relativity. According to the special theory of relativity, the
equations which express the general laws of nature pass over into
equations of the same form when, by making use of the Lorentz
transformation, we replace the spacetime variables x, y, z, t, of a
Galileian referencebody K by the spacetime variables x1, y1, z1,
t1, of a new referencebody K1. According to the general theory of
relativity, on the other hand, by application of arbitrary
substitutions of the Gauss variables x1, x2, x3, x4, the
equations must pass over into equations of the same form for every
transformation not only the Lorentz transformation corresponds to
the transition of one Gauss coordinate system into another.

If we desire to adhere to our "oldtime" threedimensional view of
things, then we can characterise the development which is being
undergone by the fundamental idea of the general theory of relativity
as follows  The special theory of relativity has reference to
Galileian domains, i.e. to those in which no gravitational field
exists. In this connection a Galileian referencebody serves as body
of reference, i.e. a rigid body the state of motion of which is so
chosen that the Galileian law of the uniform rectilinear motion of
"isolated" material points holds relatively to it.

Certain considerations suggest that we should refer the same Galileian
domains to nonGalileian referencebodies also. A gravitational field
of a special kind is then present with respect to these bodies cf.
Sections 20 and 23.

In gravitational fields there are no such things as rigid bodies with
Euclidean properties thus the fictitious rigid body of reference is
of no avail in the general theory of relativity. The motion of clocks
is also influenced by gravitational fields, and in such a way that a
physical definition of time which is made directly with the aid of
clocks has by no means the same degree of plausibility as in the
special theory of relativity.

For this reason nonrigid referencebodies are used, which are as a
whole not only moving in any way whatsoever, but which also suffer
alterations in form ad lib. during their motion. Clocks, for which the
law of motion is of any kind, however irregular, serve for the
definition of time. We have to imagine each of these clocks fixed at a
point on the nonrigid referencebody. These clocks satisfy only the
one condition, that the "readings" which are observed simultaneously
on adjacent clocks in space differ from each other by an
indefinitely small amount. This nonrigid referencebody, which might
appropriately be termed a "referencemollusc", is in the main
equivalent to a Gaussian fourdimensional coordinate system chosen
arbitrarily. That which gives the "mollusc" a certain
comprehensibility as compared with the Gauss coordinate system is the
really unjustified formal retention of the separate existence of the
space coordinates as opposed to the time coordinate. Every point on
the mollusc is treated as a spacepoint, and every material point
which is at rest relatively to it as at rest, so long as the mollusc
is considered as referencebody. The general principle of relativity
requires that all these molluscs can be used as referencebodies with
equal right and equal success in the formulation of the general laws
of nature the laws themselves must be quite independent of the choice
of mollusc.

The great power possessed by the general principle of relativity lies
in the comprehensive limitation which is imposed on the laws of nature
in consequence of what we have seen above.



THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF GRAVITATION ON THE BASIS OF THE GENERAL
PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY


If the reader has followed all our previous considerations, he will
have no further difficulty in understanding the methods leading to the
solution of the problem of gravitation.

We start off on a consideration of a Galileian domain, i.e. a domain
in which there is no gravitational field relative to the Galileian
referencebody K. The behaviour of measuringrods and clocks with
reference to K is known from the special theory of relativity,
likewise the behaviour of "isolated" material points the latter move
uniformly and in straight lines.

Now let us refer this domain to a random Gauss coordinate system or to
a "mollusc" as referencebody K1. Then with respect to K1 there is a
gravitational field G of a particular kind. We learn the behaviour
of measuringrods and clocks and also of freelymoving material points
with reference to K1 simply by mathematical transformation. We
interpret this behaviour as the behaviour of measuringrods, docks and
material points tinder the influence of the gravitational field G.
Hereupon we introduce a hypothesis that the influence of the
gravitational field on measuringrods, clocks and freelymoving
material points continues to take place according to the same laws,
even in the case where the prevailing gravitational field is not
derivable from the Galfleian special care, simply by means of a
transformation of coordinates.

The next step is to investigate the spacetime behaviour of the
gravitational field G, which was derived from the Galileian special
case simply by transformation of the coordinates. This behaviour is
formulated in a law, which is always valid, no matter how the
referencebody mollusc used in the description may be chosen.

This law is not yet the general law of the gravitational field, since
the gravitational field under consideration is of a special kind. In
order to find out the general lawoffield of gravitation we still
require to obtain a generalisation of the law as found above. This can
be obtained without caprice, however, by taking into consideration the
following demands

a The required generalisation must likewise satisfy the general
postulate of relativity.

b If there is any matter in the domain under consideration, only its
inertial mass, and thus according to Section 15 only its energy is
of importance for its etfect in exciting a field.

c Gravitational field and matter together must satisfy the law of
the conservation of energy and of impulse.

Finally, the general principle of relativity permits us to determine
the influence of the gravitational field on the course of all those
processes which take place according to known laws when a
gravitational field is absent i.e. which have already been fitted into
the frame of the special theory of relativity. In this connection we
proceed in principle according to the method which has already been
explained for measuringrods, clocks and freely moving material
points.

The theory of gravitation derived in this way from the general
postulate of relativity excels not only in its beauty  nor in
removing the defect attaching to classical mechanics which was brought
to light in Section 21 nor in interpreting the empirical law of
the equality of inertial and gravitational mass  but it has also
already explained a result of observation in astronomy, against which
classical mechanics is powerless.

If we confine the application of the theory to the case where the
gravitational fields can be regarded as being weak, and in which all
masses move with respect to the coordinate system with velocities
which are small compared with the velocity of light, we then obtain as
a first approximation the Newtonian theory. Thus the latter theory is
obtained here without any particular assumption, whereas Newton had to
introduce the hypothesis that the force of attraction between mutually
attracting material points is inversely proportional to the square of
the distance between them. If we increase the accuracy of the
calculation, deviations from the theory of Newton make their
appearance, practically all of which must nevertheless escape the test
of observation owing to their smallness.

We must draw attention here to one of these deviations. According to
Newtons theory, a planet moves round the sun in an ellipse, which
would permanently maintain its position with respect to the fixed
stars, if we could disregard the motion of the fixed stars themselves
and the action of the other planets under consideration. Thus, if we
correct the observed motion of the planets for these two influences,
and if Newtons theory be strictly correct, we ought to obtain for the
orbit of the planet an ellipse, which is fixed with reference to the
fixed stars. This deduction, which can be tested with great accuracy,
has been confirmed for all the planets save one, with the precision
that is capable of being obtained by the delicacy of observation
attainable at the present time. The sole exception is Mercury, the
planet which lies nearest the sun. Since the time of Leverrier, it has
been known that the ellipse corresponding to the orbit of Mercury,
after it has been corrected for the influences mentioned above, is not
stationary with respect to the fixed stars, but that it rotates
exceedingly slowly in the plane of the orbit and in the sense of the
orbital motion. The value obtained for this rotary movement of the
orbital ellipse was 43 seconds of arc per century, an amount ensured
to be correct to within a few seconds of arc. This effect can be
explained by means of classical mechanics only on the assumption of
hypotheses which have little probability, and which were devised
solely for this purponse.

On the basis of the general theory of relativity, it is found that the
ellipse of every planet round the sun must necessarily rotate in the
manner indicated above  that for all the planets, with the exception
of Mercury, this rotation is too small to be detected with the
delicacy of observation possible at the present time  but that in the
case of Mercury it must amount to 43 seconds of arc per century, a
result which is strictly in agreement with observation.

Apart from this one, it has hitherto been possible to make only two
deductions from the theory which admit of being tested by observation,
to wit, the curvature of light rays by the gravitational field of the
sun,x and a displacement of the spectral lines of light reaching
us from large stars, as compared with the corresponding lines for
light produced in an analogous manner terrestrially i.e. by the same
kind of atom.  These two deductions from the theory have both
been confirmed.

PART III

CONSIDERATIONS ON THE UNIVERSE AS A WHOLE


COSMOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES OF NEWTONS THEORY


Part from the difficulty discussed in Section 21, there is a second
fundamental difficulty attending classical celestial mechanics, which,
to the best of my knowledge, was first discussed in detail by the
astronomer Seeliger. If we ponder over the question as to how the
universe, considered as a whole, is to be regarded, the first answer
that suggests itself to us is surely this As regards space and time
the universe is infinite. There are stars everywhere, so that the
density of matter, although very variable in detail, is nevertheless
on the average everywhere the same. In other words However far we
might travel through space, we should find everywhere an attenuated
swarm of fixed stars of approrimately the same kind and density.

This view is not in harmony with the theory of Newton. The latter
theory rather requires that the universe should have a kind of centre
in which the density of the stars is a maximum, and that as we proceed
outwards from this centre the groupdensity of the stars should
diminish, until finally, at great distances, it is succeeded by an
infinite region of emptiness. The stellar universe ought to be a
finite island in the infinite ocean of space.

This conception is in itself not very satisfactory. It is still less
satisfactory because it leads to the result that the light emitted by
the stars and also individual stars of the stellar system are
perpetually passing out into infinite space, never to return, and
without ever again coming into interaction with other objects of
nature. Such a finite material universe would be destined to become
gradually but systematically impoverished.

In order to escape this dilemma, Seeliger suggested a modification of
Newtons law, in which he assumes that for great distances the force
of attraction between two masses diminishes more rapidly than would
result from the inverse square law. In this way it is possible for the
mean density of matter to be constant everywhere, even to infinity,
without infinitely large gravitational fields being produced. We thus
free ourselves from the distasteful conception that the material
universe ought to possess something of the nature of a centre. Of
course we purchase our emancipation from the fundamental difficulties
mentioned, at the cost of a modification and complication of Newtons
law which has neither empirical nor theoretical foundation. We can
imagine innumerable laws which would serve the same purpose, without
our being able to state a reason why one of them is to be preferred to
the others  for any one of these laws would be founded just as little
on more general theoretical principles as is the law of Newton.


  Notes

 Proof  According to the theory of Newton, the number of "lines
of force" which come from infinity and terminate in a mass m is
proportional to the mass m. If, on the average, the Mass density p0
is constant throughout tithe universe, then a sphere of volume V will
enclose the average man p0V. Thus the number of lines of force
passing through the surface F of the sphere into its interior is
proportional to p0 V. For unit area of the surface of the sphere the
number of lines of force which enters the sphere is thus proportional
to p0 VF or to p0R. Hence the intensity of the field at the
surface would ultimately become infinite with increasing radius R of
the sphere, which is impossible.



THE POSSIBILITY OF A "FINITE" AND YET "UNBOUNDED" UNIVERSE


But speculations on the structure of the universe also move in quite
another direction. The development of nonEuclidean geometry led to
the recognition of the fact, that we can cast doubt on the
infiniteness of our space without coming into conflict with the laws
of thought or with experience Riemann, Helmholtz. These questions
have already been treated in detail and with unsurpassable lucidity by
Helmholtz and Poincaré, whereas I can only touch on them briefly here.

In the first place, we imagine an existence in two dimensional space.
Flat beings with flat implements, and in particular flat rigid
measuringrods, are free to move in a plane. For them nothing exists
outside of this plane that which they observe to happen to themselves
and to their flat " things " is the allinclusive reality of their
plane. In particular, the constructions of plane Euclidean geometry
can be carried out by means of the rods e.g. the lattice construction,
considered in Section 24. In contrast to ours, the universe of
these beings is twodimensional but, like ours, it extends to
infinity. In their universe there is room for an infinite number of
identical squares made up of rods, i.e. its volume surface is
infinite. If these beings say their universe is " plane," there is
sense in the statement, because they mean that they can perform the
constructions of plane Euclidean geometry with their rods. In this
connection the individual rods always represent the same distance,
independently of their position.

Let us consider now a second twodimensional existence, but this time
on a spherical surface instead of on a plane. The flat beings with
their measuringrods and other objects fit exactly on this surface and
they are unable to leave it. Their whole universe of observation
extends exclusively over the surface of the sphere. Are these beings
able to regard the geometry of their universe as being plane geometry
and their rods withal as the realisation of " distance " ? They cannot
do this. For if they attempt to realise a straight line, they will
obtain a curve, which we " threedimensional beings " designate as a
great circle, i.e. a selfcontained line of definite finite length,
which can be measured up by means of a measuringrod. Similarly, this
universe has a finite area that can be compared with the area, of a
square constructed with rods. The great charm resulting from this
consideration lies in the recognition of the fact that the universe of
these beings is finite and yet has no limits.

But the sphericalsurface beings do not need to go on a worldtour in
order to perceive that they are not living in a Euclidean universe.
They can convince themselves of this on every part of their " world,"
provided they do not use too small a piece of it. Starting from a
point, they draw " straight lines " arcs of circles as judged in
three dimensional space of equal length in all directions. They will
call the line joining the free ends of these lines a " circle." For a
plane surface, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its
diameter, both lengths being measured with the same rod, is, according
to Euclidean geometry of the plane, equal to a constant value p, which
is independent of the diameter of the circle. On their spherical
surface our flat beings would find for this ratio the value

                        eq. 27 file eq27.gif

i.e. a smaller value than p, the difference being the more
considerable, the greater is the radius of the circle in comparison
with the radius R of the " worldsphere." By means of this relation
the spherical beings can determine the radius of their universe "
world ", even when only a relatively small part of their worldsphere
is available for their measurements. But if this part is very small
indeed, they will no longer be able to demonstrate that they are on a
spherical " world " and not on a Euclidean plane, for a small part of
a spherical surface differs only slightly from a piece of a plane of
the same size.

Thus if the spherical surface beings are living on a planet of which
the solar system occupies only a negligibly small part of the
spherical universe, they have no means of determining whether they are
living in a finite or in an infinite universe, because the " piece of
universe " to which they have access is in both cases practically
plane, or Euclidean. It follows directly from this discussion, that
for our spherebeings the circumference of a circle first increases
with the radius until the " circumference of the universe " is
reached, and that it thenceforward gradually decreases to zero for
still further increasing values of the radius. During this process the
area of the circle continues to increase more and more, until finally
it becomes equal to the total area of the whole " worldsphere."

Perhaps the reader will wonder why we have placed our " beings " on a
sphere rather than on another closed surface. But this choice has its
justification in the fact that, of all closed surfaces, the sphere is
unique in possessing the property that all points on it are
equivalent. I admit that the ratio of the circumference c of a circle
to its radius r depends on r, but for a given value of r it is the
same for all points of the " worldsphere " in other words, the "
worldsphere " is a " surface of constant curvature."

To this twodimensional sphereuniverse there is a threedimensional
analogy, namely, the threedimensional spherical space which was
discovered by Riemann. its points are likewise all equivalent. It
possesses a finite volume, which is determined by its "radius"
2p2R3. Is it possible to imagine a spherical space? To imagine a
space means nothing else than that we imagine an epitome of our "
space " experience, i.e. of experience that we can have in the
movement of " rigid " bodies. In this sense we can imagine a spherical
space.

Suppose we draw lines or stretch strings in all directions from a
point, and mark off from each of these the distance r with a
measuringrod. All the free endpoints of these lengths lie on a
spherical surface. We can specially measure up the area F of this
surface by means of a square made up of measuringrods. If the
universe is Euclidean, then F  4pR2  if it is spherical, then F is
always less than 4pR2. With increasing values of r, F increases from
zero up to a maximum value which is determined by the " worldradius,"
but for still further increasing values of r, the area gradually
diminishes to zero. At first, the straight lines which radiate from
the starting point diverge farther and farther from one another, but
later they approach each other, and finally they run together again at
a "counterpoint" to the starting point. Under such conditions they
have traversed the whole spherical space. It is easily seen that the
threedimensional spherical space is quite analogous to the
twodimensional spherical surface. It is finite i.e. of finite
volume, and has no bounds.

It may be mentioned that there is yet another kind of curved space "
elliptical space." It can be regarded as a curved space in which the
two " counterpoints " are identical indistinguishable from each
other. An elliptical universe can thus be considered to some extent
as a curved universe possessing central symmetry.

It follows from what has been said, that closed spaces without limits
are conceivable. From amongst these, the spherical space and the
elliptical excels in its simplicity, since all points on it are
equivalent. As a result of this discussion, a most interesting
question arises for astronomers and physicists, and that is whether
the universe in which we live is infinite, or whether it is finite in
the manner of the spherical universe. Our experience is far from being
sufficient to enable us to answer this question. But the general
theory of relativity permits of our answering it with a moduate degree
of certainty, and in this connection the difficulty mentioned in
Section 30 finds its solution.



THE STRUCTURE OF SPACE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY


According to the general theory of relativity, the geometrical
properties of space are not independent, but they are determined by
matter. Thus we can draw conclusions about the geometrical structure
of the universe only if we base our considerations on the state of the
matter as being something that is known. We know from experience that,
for a suitably chosen coordinate system, the velocities of the stars
are small as compared with the velocity of transmission of light. We
can thus as a rough approximation arrive at a conclusion as to the
nature of the universe as a whole, if we treat the matter as being at
rest.

We already know from our previous discussion that the behaviour of
measuringrods and clocks is influenced by gravitational fields, i.e.
by the distribution of matter. This in itself is sufficient to exclude
the possibility of the exact validity of Euclidean geometry in our
universe. But it is conceivable that our universe differs only
slightly from a Euclidean one, and this notion seems all the more
probable, since calculations show that the metrics of surrounding
space is influenced only to an exceedingly small extent by masses even
of the magnitude of our sun. We might imagine that, as regards
geometry, our universe behaves analogously to a surface which is
irregularly curved in its individual parts, but which nowhere departs
appreciably from a plane something like the rippled surface of a
lake. Such a universe might fittingly be called a quasiEuclidean
universe. As regards its space it would be infinite. But calculation
shows that in a quasiEuclidean universe the average density of matter
would necessarily be nil. Thus such a universe could not be inhabited
by matter everywhere  it would present to us that unsatisfactory
picture which we portrayed in Section 30.

If we are to have in the universe an average density of matter which
differs from zero, however small may be that difference, then the
universe cannot be quasiEuclidean. On the contrary, the results of
calculation indicate that if matter be distributed uniformly, the
universe would necessarily be spherical or elliptical. Since in
reality the detailed distribution of matter is not uniform, the real
universe will deviate in individual parts from the spherical, i.e. the
universe will be quasispherical. But it will be necessarily finite.
In fact, the theory supplies us with a simple connection   between
the spaceexpanse of the universe and the average density of matter in
it.

 For the radius R of the universe we obtain the equation

                        eq. 28 file eq28.gif

The use of the C.G.S. system in this equation gives 2k  1.08.1027
p is the average density of the matter and k is a constant connected
with the Newtonian constant of gravitation.



APPENDIX I

SIMPLE DERIVATION OF THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION
SUPPLEMENTARY TO SECTION 11


For the relative orientation of the coordinate systems indicated in
Fig. 2, the xaxes of both systems pernumently coincide. In the
present case we can divide the problem into parts by considering first
only events which are localised on the xaxis. Any such event is
represented with respect to the coordinate system K by the abscissa x
and the time t, and with respect to the system K1 by the abscissa x
and the time t. We require to find x and t when x and t are given.

A lightsignal, which is proceeding along the positive axis of x, is
transmitted according to the equation

                                x  ct

or

                 x  ct  0     .     .     .    1.

Since the same lightsignal has to be transmitted relative to K1 with
the velocity c, the propagation relative to the system K1 will be
represented by the analogous formula

                x  ct  O     .     .     .    2

Those spacetime points events which satisfy x must also satisfy
2. Obviously this will be the case when the relation

          x  ct  l x  ct     .     .     .    3.

is fulfilled in general, where l indicates a constant  for, according
to 3, the disappearance of x  ct involves the disappearance of
x  ct.

If we apply quite similar considerations to light rays which are being
transmitted along the negative xaxis, we obtain the condition

           x  ct  µx  ct    .     .     .    4.

By adding or subtracting equations 3 and 4, and introducing for
convenience the constants a and b in place of the constants l and µ,
where

                        eq. 29 file eq29.gif

and

                        eq. 30 file eq30.gif

we obtain the equations

                        eq. 31 file eq31.gif

We should thus have the solution of our problem, if the constants a
and b were known. These result from the following discussion.

For the origin of K1 we have permanently x  0, and hence according
to the first of the equations 5

                        eq. 32 file eq32.gif

If we call v the velocity with which the origin of K1 is moving
relative to K, we then have

                        eq. 33 file eq33.gif

The same value v can be obtained from equations 5, if we calculate
the velocity of another point of K1 relative to K, or the velocity
directed towards the negative xaxis of a point of K with respect to
K. In short, we can designate v as the relative velocity of the two
systems.

Furthermore, the principle of relativity teaches us that, as judged
from K, the length of a unit measuringrod which is at rest with
reference to K1 must be exactly the same as the length, as judged from
K, of a unit measuringrod which is at rest relative to K. In order
to see how the points of the xaxis appear as viewed from K, we only
require to take a " snapshot " of K1 from K this means that we have
to insert a particular value of t time of K, e.g. t  0. For this
value of t we then obtain from the first of the equations 5

                               x  ax

Two points of the xaxis which are separated by the distance Dx  I
when measured in the K1 system are thus separated in our instantaneous
photograph by the distance

                        eq. 34 file eq34.gif

But if the snapshot be taken from Kt  0, and if we eliminate t
from the equations 5, taking into account the expression 6, we
obtain

                        eq. 35 file eq35.gif

From this we conclude that two points on the xaxis separated by the
distance I relative to K will be represented on our snapshot by the
distance

                        eq. 36 file eq36.gif

But from what has been said, the two snapshots must be identical
hence Dx in 7 must be equal to Dx in 7a, so that we obtain

                        eq. 37 file eq37.gif

The equations 6 and 7b determine the constants a and b. By
inserting the values of these constants in 5, we obtain the first
and the fourth of the equations given in Section 11.

                        eq. 38 file eq38.gif

Thus we have obtained the Lorentz transformation for events on the
xaxis. It satisfies the condition

         x2  c2t2  x2  c2t2    .     .     .    8a.

The extension of this result, to include events which take place
outside the xaxis, is obtained by retaining equations 8 and
supplementing them by the relations

                        eq. 39 file eq39.gif

In this way we satisfy the postulate of the constancy of the velocity
of light in vacuo for rays of light of arbitrary direction, both for
the system K and for the system K. This may be shown in the following
manner.

We suppose a lightsignal sent out from the origin of K at the time t
 0. It will be propagated according to the equation

                        eq. 40 file eq40.gif

or, if we square this equation, according to the equation

          x2  y2  z2  c2t2  0    .     .     .    10.

It is required by the law of propagation of light, in conjunction with
the postulate of relativity, that the transmission of the signal in
question should take place  as judged from K1  in accordance with
the corresponding formula

                               r  ct

or,

       x2  y2  z2  c2t2  0    .     .     .    10a.

In order that equation 10a may be a consequence of equation 10, we
must have

   x2  y2  z2  c2t2  s x2  y2  z2  c2t2       11.

Since equation 8a must hold for points on the xaxis, we thus have s
 I. It is easily seen that the Lorentz transformation really
satisfies equation 11 for s  I for 11 is a consequence of 8a
and 9, and hence also of 8 and 9. We have thus derived the
Lorentz transformation.

The Lorentz transformation represented by 8 and 9 still requires
to be generalised. Obviously it is immaterial whether the axes of K1
be chosen so that they are spatially parallel to those of K. It is
also not essential that the velocity of translation of K1 with respect
to K should be in the direction of the xaxis. A simple consideration
shows that we are able to construct the Lorentz transformation in this
general sense from two kinds of transformations, viz. from Lorentz
transformations in the special sense and from purely spatial
transformations. which corresponds to the replacement of the
rectangular coordinate system by a new system with its axes pointing
in other directions.

Mathematically, we can characterise the generalised Lorentz
transformation thus 

It expresses x, y, x, t, in terms of linear homogeneous functions
of x, y, x, t, of such a kind that the relation

     x2  y2  z2  c2t2  x2  y2  z2  c2t2       11a.

is satisficd identically. That is to say If we substitute their
expressions in x, y, x, t, in place of x, y, x, t, on the
lefthand side, then the lefthand side of 11a agrees with the
righthand side.



APPENDIX II

MINKOWSKIS FOURDIMENSIONAL SPACE "WORLD"
SUPPLEMENTARY TO SECTION 17


We can characterise the Lorentz transformation still more simply if we
introduce the imaginary eq. 25 in place of t, as timevariable. If, in
accordance with this, we insert

                              x1  x
                              x2  y
                              x3  z
                              x4  eq. 25

and similarly for the accented system K1, then the condition which is
identically satisfied by the transformation can be expressed thus 

x12  x22  x32  x42  x12  x22  x32  x42
    12.

That is, by the aforementioned choice of " coordinates," 11a see
the end of Appendix II is transformed into this equation.

We see from 12 that the imaginary time coordinate x4, enters into
the condition of transformation in exactly the same way as the space
coordinates x1, x2, x3. It is due to this fact that, according
to the theory of relativity, the " time "x4, enters into natural
laws in the same form as the space co ordinates x1, x2, x3.

A fourdimensional continuum described by the "coordinates" x1,
x2, x3, x4, was called "world" by Minkowski, who also termed a
pointevent a " worldpoint." From a "happening" in threedimensional
space, physics becomes, as it were, an " existence " in the
fourdimensional " world."

This fourdimensional " world " bears a close similarity to the
threedimensional " space " of Euclidean analytical geometry. If we
introduce into the latter a new Cartesian coordinate system x1,
x2, x3 with the same origin, then x1, x2, x3, are
linear homogeneous functions of x1, x2, x3 which identically
satisfy the equation

        x12  x22  x32  x12  x22  x32

The analogy with 12 is a complete one. We can regard Minkowskis "
world " in a formal manner as a fourdimensional Euclidean space with
an imaginary time coordinate  the Lorentz transformation corresponds
to a " rotation " of the coordinate system in the fourdimensional "
world."



APPENDIX III

THE EXPERIMENTAL CONFIRMATION OF THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY


From a systematic theoretical point of view, we may imagine the
process of evolution of an empirical science to be a continuous
process of induction. Theories are evolved and are expressed in short
compass as statements of a large number of individual observations in
the form of empirical laws, from which the general laws can be
ascertained by comparison. Regarded in this way, the development of a
science bears some resemblance to the compilation of a classified
catalogue. It is, as it were, a purely empirical enterprise.

But this point of view by no means embraces the whole of the actual
process  for it slurs over the important part played by intuition and
deductive thought in the development of an exact science. As soon as a
science has emerged from its initial stages, theoretical advances are
no longer achieved merely by a process of arrangement. Guided by
empirical data, the investigator rather develops a system of thought
which, in general, is built up logically from a small number of
fundamental assumptions, the socalled axioms. We call such a system
of thought a theory. The theory finds the justification for its
existence in the fact that it correlates a large number of single
observations, and it is just here that the " truth " of the theory
lies.

Corresponding to the same complex of empirical data, there may be
several theories, which differ from one another to a considerable
extent. But as regards the deductions from the theories which are
capable of being tested, the agreement between the theories may be so
complete that it becomes difficult to find any deductions in which the
two theories differ from each other. As an example, a case of general
interest is available in the province of biology, in the Darwinian
theory of the development of species by selection in the struggle for
existence, and in the theory of development which is based on the
hypothesis of the hereditary transmission of acquired characters.

We have another instance of farreaching agreement between the
deductions from two theories in Newtonian mechanics on the one hand,
and the general theory of relativity on the other. This agreement goes
so far, that up to the preseat we have been able to find only a few
deductions from the general theory of relativity which are capable of
investigation, and to which the physics of prerelativity days does
not also lead, and this despite the profound difference in the
fundamental assumptions of the two theories. In what follows, we shall
again consider these important deductions, and we shall also discuss
the empirical evidence appertaining to them which has hitherto been
obtained.

 a Motion of the Perihelion of Mercury

According to Newtonian mechanics and Newtons law of gravitation, a
planet which is revolving round the sun would describe an ellipse
round the latter, or, more correctly, round the common centre of
gravity of the sun and the planet. In such a system, the sun, or the
common centre of gravity, lies in one of the foci of the orbital
ellipse in such a manner that, in the course of a planetyear, the
distance sunplanet grows from a minimum to a maximum, and then
decreases again to a minimum. If instead of Newtons law we insert a
somewhat different law of attraction into the calculation, we find
that, according to this new law, the motion would still take place in
such a manner that the distance sunplanet exhibits periodic
variations but in this case the angle described by the line joining
sun and planet during such a period from perihelionclosest
proximity to the sunto perihelion would differ from 3600. The line
of the orbit would not then be a closed one but in the course of time
it would fill up an annular part of the orbital plane, viz. between
the circle of least and the circle of greatest distance of the planet
from the sun.

According also to the general theory of relativity, which differs of
course from the theory of Newton, a small variation from the
NewtonKepler motion of a planet in its orbit should take place, and
in such away, that the angle described by the radius sunplanet
between one perhelion and the next should exceed that corresponding to
one complete revolution by an amount given by

                        eq. 41 file eq41.gif

N.B.  One complete revolution corresponds to the angle 2p in the
absolute angular measure customary in physics, and the above
expression giver the amount by which the radius sunplanet exceeds
this angle during the interval between one perihelion and the next.
In this expression a represents the major semiaxis of the ellipse, e
its eccentricity, c the velocity of light, and T the period of
revolution of the planet. Our result may also be stated as follows 
According to the general theory of relativity, the major axis of the
ellipse rotates round the sun in the same sense as the orbital motion
of the planet. Theory requires that this rotation should amount to 43
seconds of arc per century for the planet Mercury, but for the other
Planets of our solar system its magnitude should be so small that it
would necessarily escape detection. 

In point of fact, astronomers have found that the theory of Newton
does not suffice to calculate the observed motion of Mercury with an
exactness corresponding to that of the delicacy of observation
attainable at the present time. After taking account of all the
disturbing influences exerted on Mercury by the remaining planets, it
was found Leverrier 1859 and Newcomb 1895 that an unexplained
perihelial movement of the orbit of Mercury remained over, the amount
of which does not differ sensibly from the above mentioned 43 seconds
of arc per century. The uncertainty of the empirical result amounts to
a few seconds only.

 b Deflection of Light by a Gravitational Field

In Section 22 it has been already mentioned that according to the
general theory of relativity, a ray of light will experience a
curvature of its path when passing through a gravitational field, this
curvature being similar to that experienced by the path of a body
which is projected through a gravitational field. As a result of this
theory, we should expect that a ray of light which is passing close to
a heavenly body would be deviated towards the latter. For a ray of
light which passes the sun at a distance of D sunradii from its
centre, the angle of deflection a should amount to

                        eq. 42 file eq42.gif

It may be added that, according to the theory, half of Figure 05 this
deflection is produced by the Newtonian field of attraction of the
sun, and the other half by the geometrical modification " curvature
" of space caused by the sun.

This result admits of an experimental test by means of the
photographic registration of stars during a total eclipse of the sun.
The only reason why we must wait for a total eclipse is because at
every other time the atmosphere is so strongly illuminated by the
light from the sun that the stars situated near the suns disc are
invisible. The predicted effect can be seen clearly from the
accompanying diagram. If the sun S were not present, a star which is
practically infinitely distant would be seen in the direction D1, as
observed front the earth. But as a consequence of the deflection of
light from the star by the sun, the star will be seen in the direction
D2, i.e. at a somewhat greater distance from the centre of the sun
than corresponds to its real position.

In practice, the question is tested in the following way. The stars in
the neighbourhood of the sun are photographed during a solar eclipse.
In addition, a second photograph of the same stars is taken when the
sun is situated at another position in the sky, i.e. a few months
earlier or later. As compared whh the standard photograph, the
positions of the stars on the eclipsephotograph ought to appear
displaced radially outwards away from the centre of the sun by an
amount corresponding to the angle a.

We are indebted to the British Royal Society and to the Royal
Astronomical Society for the investigation of this important
deduction. Undaunted by the first world war and by difficulties of
both a material and a psychological nature aroused by the war, these
societies equipped two expeditions  to Sobral Brazil, and to the
island of Principe West Africa  and sent several of Britains most
celebrated astronomers Eddington, Cottingham, Crommelin, Davidson,
in order to obtain photographs of the solar eclipse of 29th May, 1919.
The relative discrepancies to be expected between the stellar
photographs obtained during the eclipse and the comparison photographs
amounted to a few hundredths of a millimetre only. Thus great accuracy
was necessary in making the adjustments required for the taking of the
photographs, and in their subsequent measurement.

The results of the measurements confirmed the theory in a thoroughly
satisfactory manner. The rectangular components of the observed and of
the calculated deviations of the stars in seconds of arc are set
forth in the following table of results 

                      Table 01 file table01.gif

 c Displacement of Spectral Lines Towards the Red

In Section 23 it has been shown that in a system K1 which is in
rotation with regard to a Galileian system K, clocks of identical
construction, and which are considered at rest with respect to the
rotating referencebody, go at rates which are dependent on the
positions of the clocks. We shall now examine this dependence
quantitatively. A clock, which is situated at a distance r from the
centre of the disc, has a velocity relative to K which is given by

                                V  wr

where w represents the angular velocity of rotation of the disc K1
with respect to K. If v0, represents the number of ticks of the
clock per unit time " rate " of the clock relative to K when the
clock is at rest, then the " rate " of the clock v when it is moving
relative to K with a velocity V, but at rest with respect to the disc,
will, in accordance with Section 12, be given by

                        eq. 43 file eq43.gif

or with sufficient accuracy by

                        eq. 44 file eq44.gif

This expression may also be stated in the following form

                        eq. 45 file eq45.gif

If we represent the difference of potential of the centrifugal force
between the position of the clock and the centre of the disc by f,
i.e. the work, considered negatively, which must be performed on the
unit of mass against the centrifugal force in order to transport it
from the position of the clock on the rotating disc to the centre of
the disc, then we have

                        eq. 46 file eq46.gif

From this it follows that

                        eq. 47 file eq47.gif

In the first place, we see from this expression that two clocks of
identical construction will go at different rates when situated at
different distances from the centre of the disc. This result is aiso
valid from the standpoint of an observer who is rotating with the
disc.

Now, as judged from the disc, the latter is in a gravititional field
of potential f, hence the result we have obtained will hold quite
generally for gravitational fields. Furthermore, we can regard an atom
which is emitting spectral lines as a clock, so that the following
statement will hold

An atom absorbs or emits light of a frequency which is dependent on
the potential of the gravitational field in which it is situated.

The frequency of an atom situated on the surface of a heavenly body
will be somewhat less than the frequency of an atom of the same
element which is situated in free space or on the surface of a
smaller celestial body.

Now f   K Mr, where K is Newtons constant of gravitation, and M
is the mass of the heavenly body. Thus a displacement towards the red
ought to take place for spectral lines produced at the surface of
stars as compared with the spectral lines of the same element produced
at the surface of the earth, the amount of this displacement being

                        eq. 48 file eq48.gif

For the sun, the displacement towards the red predicted by theory
amounts to about two millionths of the wavelength. A trustworthy
calculation is not possible in the case of the stars, because in
general neither the mass M nor the radius r are known.

It is an open question whether or not this effect exists, and at the
present time 1920 astronomers are working with great zeal towards
the solution. Owing to the smallness of the effect in the case of the
sun, it is difficult to form an opinion as to its existence. Whereas
Grebe and Bachem Bonn, as a result of their own measurements and
those of Evershed and Schwarzschild on the cyanogen bands, have placed
the existence of the effect almost beyond doubt, while other
investigators, particularly St. John, have been led to the opposite
opinion in consequence of their measurements.

Mean displacements of lines towards the less refrangible end of the
spectrum are certainly revealed by statistical investigations of the
fixed stars  but up to the present the examination of the available
data does not allow of any definite decision being arrived at, as to
whether or not these displacements are to be referred in reality to
the effect of gravitation. The results of observation have been
collected together, and discussed in detail from the standpoint of the
question which has been engaging our attention here, in a paper by E.
Freundlich entitled "Zur Prüfung der allgemeinen
RelativitumlauttsTheorie" Die Naturwissenschaften, 1919, No. 35,
p. 520 Julius Springer, Berlin.

At all events, a definite decision will be reached during the next few
years. If the displacement of spectral lines towards the red by the
gravitational potential does not exist, then the general theory of
relativity will be untenable. On the other hand, if the cause of the
displacement of spectral lines be definitely traced to the
gravitational potential, then the study of this displacement will
furnish us with important information as to the mass of the heavenly
bodies. 5A


  Notes

 Especially since the next planet Venus has an orbit that is
almost an exact circle, which makes it more difficult to locate the
perihelion with precision.

The displacentent of spectral lines towards the red end of the
spectrum was definitely established by Adams in 1924, by observations
on the dense companion of Sirius, for which the effect is about thirty
times greater than for the Sun. R.W.L.  translator



APPENDIX IV

THE STRUCTURE OF SPACE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY
SUPPLEMENTARY TO SECTION 32


Since the publication of the first edition of this little book, our
knowledge about the structure of space in the large " cosmological
problem " has had an important development, which ought to be
mentioned even in a popular presentation of the subject.

My original considerations on the subject were based on two
hypotheses

1 There exists an average density of matter in the whole of space
which is everywhere the same and different from zero.

2 The magnitude " radius " of space is independent of time.

Both these hypotheses proved to be consistent, according to the
general theory of relativity, but only after a hypothetical term was
added to the field equations, a term which was not required by the
theory as such nor did it seem natural from a theoretical point of
view " cosmological term of the field equations ".

Hypothesis 2 appeared unavoidable to me at the time, since I thought
that one would get into bottomless speculations if one departed from
it.

However, already in the twenties, the Russian mathematician Friedman
showed that a different hypothesis was natural from a purely
theoretical point of view. He realized that it was possible to
preserve hypothesis 1 without introducing the less natural
cosmological term into the field equations of gravitation, if one was
ready to drop hypothesis 2. Namely, the original field equations
admit a solution in which the " world radius " depends on time
expanding space. In that sense one can say, according to Friedman,
that the theory demands an expansion of space.

A few years later Hubble showed, by a special investigation of the
extragalactic nebulae " milky ways ", that the spectral lines
emitted showed a red shift which increased regularly with the distance
of the nebulae. This can be interpreted in regard to our present
knowledge only in the sense of Dopplers principle, as an expansive
motion of the system of stars in the large  as required, according
to Friedman, by the field equations of gravitation. Hubbles discovery
can, therefore, be considered to some extent as a confirmation of the
theory.

There does arise, however, a strange difficulty. The interpretation of
the galactic lineshift discovered by Hubble as an expansion which
can hardly be doubted from a theoretical point of view, leads to an
origin of this expansion which lies " only " about 109 years ago,
while physical astronomy makes it appear likely that the development
of individual stars and systems of stars takes considerably longer. It
is in no way known how this incongruity is to be overcome.

I further want to rernark that the theory of expanding space, together
with the empirical data of astronomy, permit no decision to be reached
about the finite or infinite character of threedimensional space,
while the original " static " hypothesis of space yielded the closure
finiteness of space.
